Carlson, 84, Founder Of Trading Stamp Conglomerate","Curtis L. Carlson, 84, Founder Of Trading Stamp Conglomerate"," **********Curtis L. Carlson, who borrowed $55 from his landlord in 1938 and didn't look back until he had turned a fledgling grocery store trading stamp company into one of the world's largest private businesses,  died on Friday at a hospital near his home in Minneapolis. He was 84 and had been the sole owner of the Carlson Companies, an international conglomerate with 150,000 employees and $20 billion in annual revenue. **********For a corporation whose more than 100 separate companies include the Radisson and Regent International hotel chains, T.G.I. Friday's and half a dozen other restaurant chains, several travel agencies, a cruise line, the nation's largest marketing services company, vast real estate holdings and a host of other operations in 140 countries, the Carlson Companies had distinctly humble beginnings. So did Mr. Carlson. **********Mr. Carlson, the son of a Swedish immigrant who became a neighborhood grocer, had a childhood worthy of a Norman Rockwell painting with highlights by John D. Rockefeller. **********He was a golf caddy at 9, had his first newspaper route at 11 and  quickly added two others. He also operated a newsstand at a busy intersection, worked his way through college driving a soft-drink truck and engaged in a little light loansharking. **********In an exercise worthy of selling refrigerators to Eskimos, Mr. Carlson as an 18-year-old summertime bank messenger would lend cash-strapped tellers $5 on a Friday and collect $6 on payday the following Monday, transactions whose three-day interest works out to an annual percentage rate exceeding 2,400 percent. **********Somewhat redundantly studying economics at the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson graduated in 1937 and went to work as a $110-a-month soap salesman for Procter & Gamble. But he did not stay there for long. **********At a time when some local department stores were seeking to assure repeat business by giving customers Security Red trading stamps, exchangeable for premiums, Mr. Carlson realized that such stamps would be ideal for grocery stores, whose identical products left them little room to distinguish themselves from the pack. **********Acting on his vision, Mr. Carlson created the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938, with a $55 loan -- and a bit of skulduggery: He paid a department store secretary $10 for a copy of the Security Red Stamp master contract, which became his blueprint. **********The idea was that a grocer would pay Mr. Carlson $14.50 for stamps that could be exchanged for products that cost $10 wholesale but had a much higher retail value. That made the stamps attractive to the grocer and to the store's customers, but not at first glance to Mr. Carlson, whose $4.50 spread would barely cover costs and overhead. **********The magic of the business was that while the grocer would pay for the stamps as they were issued, it might be months before customers accumulated enough stamps to redeem them (a four-slice toaster proved to be the most popular premium) and some would not be redeemed at all, leaving Mr. Carlson with the float -- the use of the money -- for other investments. **********The trick was to sell the program to enough stores to create a sizable float. But as a salesman, Mr. Carlson -- who married his college sweetheart, Arlene Martin about the time he started the business -- was shameless. To draw attention to his program he had his wife dress up in an eye-catching drum majorette uniform and march through prospective stores extolling the glories of Gold Bond stamps. **********By 1941, he had signed up 200 accounts, but shortages created by World War II made sales incentives superfluous, and for a while he had to take a job with his father-in-law's clothing business. **********Once the war was over in 1945, expansion came steadily. Indeed,  Gold Bond did well enough to finance a series of important acquisitions. By 1962, the company had major investments in suburban Minneapolis real estate, including the site of what became its $300 million headquarters in Minnetonka, and acquired the downtown Radisson Hotel, which rapidly expanded into a 350-hotel chain. **********As a result of the diversification, when the stamp business began to decline in 1968, the company continued to thrive. It changed its name to the Carlson Companies in 1973. **********According to company figures, annual revenue, which did not reach $1 million until 1952, had climbed to $100 million by 1968, reached $1 billion in 1976 and topped $10 billion in 1993, with most of the growth resulting from a blistering pace of diversification. **********Although he acquired an 85-foot yacht, a luxurious hunting lodge, a family compound at Lake Minnetonka and other trappings of wealth, Mr. Carlson found nothing quite so much fun as business. **********Accordingly, he became known as such a hands-on boss that his executives made few major decisions, though they rarely complained. He paid them so well (the top 25 getting new luxury cars every year) that they were said to be bound to the company by golden handcuffs. **********Never tempted to sell stock to the public, Mr. Carlson took pains a decade ago to keep his company private -- and in family hands -- after his death by placing all his businesses in a holding company, which his two daughters, Marilyn Nelson and Barbara Gage, will now jointly own. He also set up trusts to hold nonvoting stock for his 8 grandchildren, 6 great grandchildren and other relatives. **********Mr. Carlson, who is also survived by his wife, Arlene, and by a brother, Warren, was so devoted to his business that after a brief retirement and quadruple bypass heart surgery, he resumed control in 1991 and continued to run the business until retiring again last year in favor of his elder daughter, Marilyn. **********A man who gave millions to the University of Minnesota and other charities, Mr. Carlson insisted the lure of money was not what drove him. ''You keep score with the money you make,'' he once said, ''but you've got to get a thrill out of doing something that works.''"

The rate reductions were not coordinated but reflected growing alarm that economies are stalling and need a boost that would come from lowered borrowing costs. **********There had been some expectations that rates would be lowered. But the European Central Bank's cut was twice as deep as had been anticipated. The announcement -- which came after European financial markets had closed but with nearly four hours of trading remaining on Wall Street -- ignited a broad rally in American stocks, and major market indexes all closed at record highs.  Even as they reduced borrowing costs, the European central bankers said such a step was not a real solution to Europe's high unemployment.  Business Day, page C1."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/14/business/patents-vegetable-oil-lubricant-biodegradable-said-be-more-efficient-than.html,Sabra Chartrand,1999-06-14,James Lambert and Duane Johnson receive patent for vegetable oil lubricant that is cleaner and more efficient than petroleum-based motor oils; William Hayday and Stephen Bates receive patent for dry-cleaning solvent that is biodegradable and nonto...,754,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Patents; Vegetable oil lubricant is biodegradable and said to be more efficient than petroleum-based oils.,Patents; Vegetable oil lubricant is biodegradable and said to be more efficient than petroleum-based oils.," **********EFFORTS to make cars more environmentally sound have centered on designing cleaner-running engines, and eliminating the need for gasoline in favor of electricity. But presumably any car will still have an engine made up of some moving metal parts, and that requires lubricants. Cars, like trains, lawn mowers or chain saws, rely on petroleum-based motor oils. And that brings those concerned about the environment right back to the drawing board. Even an electric car may produce toxic waste from motor oil. **********But James Lambert and Duane Johnson have developed an alternative. They have patented a vegetable oil lubricant. Their invention can be circulated in internal combustion engines, or sprayed in one-time applications like those necessary for lubricating train rails. **********The inventors, from Colorado Springs, plan for their lubricant to be ''a total replacement for current petroleum and vegetable-based additives to petroleum.'' **********Years ago, car owners who changed their own oil could just dump a pan of dirty black oil into the nearest sewer drain. Now that people understand how toxic oil waste can be to soil, water, plants, animals and people, used motor oil must be discarded carefully. **********But other petroleum-based lubricants are still regularly dumped in the open. **********Some lubricants are also used in what the inventors identify as ''total loss applications,'' in which oils are  applied only once and then thrown away. Trains use such oils, spewing huge amounts of petroleum waste onto the ground. **********''A train alone may consume five gallons of oil per 1,000 miles as the oil is sprayed on the track to lubricate the wheels,'' the inventors write in their patent. ''This amounts to a total of 300,000 gallons annually being discarded along railings within the U.S. alone.'' **********Since the oils used in cars and on train rails are petroleum based, they are not biodegradable. In addition, chemicals are usually added to improve the oil's consistency and performance. And of course, these oils are distilled from crude petroleum, a nonrenewable natural resource. **********Mr. Lambert and Mr. Johnson hope to eliminate concerns over motor oils altogether. Their patent covers a vegetable oil lubricant they say is biodegradable as well as more efficient at lubrication and heat transfer than petroleum-based oils. Their lubricant uses three elements: a base oil, an oil made up of hydroxy fatty acids and an oil made up of vegetable or animal waxes. **********The patent stipulates that the base oil come from unrefined vegetable oils like soybean, canola, rapeseed, crambe, safflower or sunflower. The inventors prefer to get their hydroxy fatty acids from castor, and their waxes from jojoba, meadowfoam or lanolin. Natural antioxidants are also present in the lubricant, and the inventors say that synthetic antioxidants may also be added. **********The patent, which belongs to the Agro Management Group of Colorado Springs, is 5,888,947. **********Cleaning Up The Dry Cleaners **********The dry-cleaning industry has also been plagued with the environmental, health and occupational hazards of the solvent usually used to clean clothes, pechloroethylene. Researchers have worked for years to find an alternative to the chemical known commonly as Perc. **********William Hayday, from Woodbury, N.Y., and Stephen Bates, from Huntington, N.Y., have won a patent for an alternative they say cleans clothes better than Perc without any of Perc's drawbacks. **********Perc became popular in dry-cleaning because it does not ruin dyes, damage or shrink fabrics, and is nonflammable and easily distilled. **********But its uses are far more extensive than clothes cleaning. Perc is also a popular industrial degreasing agent. **********''The industrial uses of Perc are approximately tenfold greater than its use as a solvent for dry cleaning,'' the inventors state in their patent. **********But Perc is also damages water supplies, soil and the ozone layer. Any substitutes must prove as effective at dry cleaning and degreasing, while also being biodegradable and nontoxic. **********To that end, the inventors have discovered that ''a particular propylene glycol ether, when mixed with certain weight percentages of water to form an azeotropic mixture'' creates a solvent that cleans clothes better than Perc. (In an azeotropic mixture the vapor composition is identical to that of the liquid, the inventors explained, so the liquid and vapor act as one substance). **********The inventors say their patented solvent also degreases metals, cleans electronic components and scours and mills woolens better than Perc. It also weighs less than water, making it easier to dispose of, since unlike Perc, it will not sink to the bottom of a water supply. **********Mr. Hayday and Mr. Bates received patent 5,888,250. **********Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231."

It amounts to about $5,000 for each of the 9,200 members of the Allied Pilots Association, the independent union that represents the pilots. It is also more than the union's $38 million cash reserves, raising the issue of whether the union will survive and whether individual pilots will have to write out checks to meet the union's obligation. **********The union has 15 days to appeal the judge's decision, and it said it planned to do so. Some labor lawyers said the union had a strong case for either reducing the damage award or having it overthrown. But others suggested that they might have a difficult time on appeal. **********In either case, the process will take months, if not years. Meanwhile, American, which is the country's second-largest carrier, and its pilots still have to work out their differences or the airline could face more disruption. **********''Unfortunately, this fine does not put us one step closer to what both A.P.A. and management need,'' said Richard T. Lavoy, the union's president. **********That, he added, is a negotiated settlement to the dispute, which began in December after the AMR Corporation, American's parent, bought Reno Air, a small airline in the West. **********The union said the acquisition of Reno Air violated its contract, which guarantees that A.P.A. members will fly all large jets at the company. But what they really want is for the company to acknowledge the violation and agree to a procedure for any future mergers. **********The company countered that it had not violated the contract and that it planned to integrate Reno into American over 18 months. It also said it was eager to conclude an agreement. **********The situation boiled over in early February, when frustrated pilots began to call in sick, crippling American's operations. The airline was forced to cancel more than 6,600 flights over 10 days, inconveniencing more than 600,000 passengers during the busy Presidents' Day holiday. **********At the company's request, Judge Joe Kendall of the Federal District Court in Dallas ordered the pilots back to work. But operations did not return to normal until the judge cited the union and its president and vice president for contempt. Thursday's award was based on his assessment of the damage suffered by American in the three days after he issued his restraining order. **********Since then, the union and American have engaged in several rounds of talks with a Federal mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. But so far the talks have not yielded much. It is hard to imagine that the company's apparent attempt to bankrupt the union is going to help the negotiations. **********Indeed, American's public comments appear designed to drive a wedge between A.P.A. members and their leaders. Chris Chiames, an AMR spokesman, said after the damage award was announced that ''It is a shame that the A.P.A. is dominated by a leadership that is only interested in confrontation.'' **********There is evidence the union is already divided. A vote last month to elect the union chief representing the pilots in Chicago pitted the incumbent, who is sympathetic to the union's current leadership, against a challenger who campaigned for closer relations with management. The incumbent won by just 10 votes. **********''It scared the daylights out of me,'' one pilot who backs the leadership and insisted on anonymity said of the vote. **********Trying to overthrow the union leadership is a risky strategy. It's three top officers still have two years left in their terms. Impeachment requires a majority vote of the pilots. **********Opposing the union's current officers does not necessarily mean that rank-and-file pilots sympathize with management. A second pilot who took part in the sickout and spoke on the condition of anonymity said he believed he had been misled by the union. ''We were led to believe that we had run out of options, that the only thing left to do was vote with our feet,'' he said. Now he is convinced that the leadership should have pursued other, legal alternatives. **********Yet at the same time management's refusal to come around has convinced the pilot that the company is planning to make more acquisitions that will threaten pilot jobs. ''All we really wanted was for the company to acknowledge that they need A.P.A. permission,'' he said, referring to the Reno Air deal. ''That American was prepared to take a major financial hit on this to me means that this is a lot more important to American than we thought.'' **********It is not clear whether the A.P.A. has strike insurance, but Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group, said that because the union was found guilty of breaking the law an insurer would not be required to make a payout. **********But the threat to the union posed by the damage award may not be as dire as it appears. Pilots are highly paid and their union dues are only 1 percent of their salaries, a relatively small figure compared with other unions. An A.P.A. spokesman said the damage award would not affect its daily operations. **********However, some pilots are wondering whether it makes sense for their union to remain independent. When the pilots struck two years ago, President Clinton used his executive powers to order them back to work after only a few minutes. But Mr. Clinton did not intervene last summer when pilots at Northwest Airlines, who are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, which is affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., went on strike. **********Now, American pilots are talking about joining A.L.P.A. or somehow allying with a national union that would give them more clout. ''Crandall always liked the fact that there were no A.F.L.-C.I.O. unions on the property,'' said a labor lawyer active in the airline industry who insisted on anonymity, referring to Robert L. Crandall, AMR's former chief executive. ''I don't know how management would feel about driving the pilots into the arms of A.L.P.A.'' **********Shares of AMR rose $2 yesterday, to $68.25, on the New York Stock Exchange."

Council Shelves Proposal on Upgrading Iraq Oil Industry,U.N. Council Shelves Proposal on Upgrading Iraq Oil Industry," **********A recommendation by Secretary General Kofi Annan that Iraq be allowed to double the amount it may spend on upgrading its oil industry was shelved by the Security Council today, somewhat to the surprise of the United States and Britain, which were prepared for a spirited debate with France and Russia over the request. **********France's representative, Alain Dejammet, said in an interview afterward that his Government still considered it ''quite reasonable'' to allow Iraq to spend an additional $300 million on oil spare parts in the current six-month period of the ''oil for food'' program. But he added that the French did not want to provoke more controversy while the Council was trying to devise a new arms monitoring system for Iraq. **********Other diplomats said the Russians had also agreed to put off consideration of the proposal until next month, when the Security Council will debate the next six-month phase of the program under which Iraq is to sell limited amounts of oil to pay for urgent civilian needs. Iraqis are earning record amounts because of the high price of oil. **********The Council was briefed on the program today by Benon Sevan, the overall director of civilian operations in Iraq, and Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef, the children's fund, who has just returned from a visit to Baghdad. **********Mr. Annan proposed to the Council this month that Iraq be allowed to spend $600 million of the money gained in controlled oil sales. He based his recommendation on advice from independent experts who say Iraq's oil industry is fraught with worker safety and environmental hazards. **********The Iraqis made the same request. **********The United States questions whether the extra money would upgrade equipment strictly related to the permitted pumping programs, or might go to other projects. **********Mr. Annan and his Iraqi experts have criticized holds that Washington and London have placed on other contracts that Iraq presented for buying goods for public utilities and other services to the population. **********Mr. Sevan said today that many of those holds occur because not enough technical information accompanies applications to the Council's Iraqi sanctions committee, or because some companies have a track record of trying to help Iraq evade restrictions in the past. **********Peter Burleigh, who has managed the Iraq issue for the United States on the Security Council this week while Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American representative, has been in Washington fighting for Congressional action on American dues to the United Nations, told reporters after the Council meeting today that ''the world knows that Iraq has a demonstrated commitment to both sustaining and possibly rebuilding their weapons of mass destruction.'' **********''I went into some detail about the reasons why the U.S. puts a hold on various contracts,'' Mr. Burleigh said. ''There are a variety of reasons, first and foremost concern about potential dual-use items -- dual use in having both a civilian and a military potential use.'' **********''We go over every contract with that question in mind,'' he added. American diplomats have in effect made the contract review process a partial replacement for monitoring the disposition of certain flagged imports on the ground by weapons inspectors, who have not worked in Iraq since December. **********Ms. Bellamy said that on her trip to Iraq, she saw great hardships, ''but I didn't view a country about to collapse.''"

Like similar vehicles planned for next year by the General Motors Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company, the Sport Trac has the passenger compartment of a four-door sport utility vehicle but also has a short, open truck bed in back. **********New classes of automobiles come along rarely, and it is a particularly unusual example of parallel automotive evolution for three companies to try to create the same new market at the same time. The coming proliferation of sport utility pickups is a sign that the light truck market is starting to resemble the car market, in which auto makers are forced to bear the cost of designing dozens of vehicles of various shapes and sizes to compete in ever-smaller market niches. **********Joseph C. Collins Jr., Ford's brand manager for sport utility vehicles and minivans, said that 21 new sport utility vehicle models would be reaching the market in the next year and a half, so Ford had to come up with new designs like the Sport Trac to distinguish itself. ''We're going to have a plethora of S.U.V.'s in the marketplace, and that's a problem and a challenge,'' he said. **********Ford dealers here were enthusiastic about the new vehicle, saying it would appeal to people who perceived pickup trucks as too plain but still wanted to be able to carry big objects like chairs or camping equipment. ''I can name 10 customers off the top of my head who are willing to buy this truck,'' said Laura Martin, a Ford dealer from Bremen, Ind., who attended the convention. **********But auto analysts say that sport utility pickups are not different enough from sport utility vehicles and pickups to prompt Americans to flock to dealerships. ''It isn't going to expand the market the way the Explorer did'' when Ford introduced it in 1990, said James Hall, the president of industry analysis at Auto Pacific Inc., a market research firm based in Santa Ana, Calif. ''It'll parasite sales from compact pickups and sport utilities.'' **********Sport utility vehicles have become the lifeblood of the auto industry in recent years, with profits of $5,000 to $15,000 each, because they can be built cheaply like pickups but are in such demand that they can be sold with big markups. As more models crowd the market, these margins are starting to fall but remain far higher than for any other types of automobiles. The auto industry hopes that it can charge the same markups on sport utility pickups as on sport utility vehicles, in which case profit margins would actually improve for customers who switch to the new vehicles from pickups. **********Sport utility pickups, like normal pickups and sport utility vehicles, will be regulated as light trucks, so they will be subject to more lenient fuel economy, pollution, safety and tax rules than cars. As is the case for many sport utility vehicles, Ford decided to produce the vehicle in 1996, before criticism of sport utility vehicles over safety and pollution concerns began to emerge. **********Because most sport utility vehicles are essentially pickup trucks with fancy interiors and more sporty exteriors, the new sport utility pickups are not as expensive to design as new vehicles would be. The Sport Trac, for example, combines two Ford vehicles that already share a common underbody: the Explorer sport utility vehicle and the Ranger pickup. **********The Sport Trac has more rear seat room than a Ranger, but only a four and a half foot bed, not the Ranger's six-foot bed. **********The Sport Trac will be the first high-volume sport utility pickup on the market. Nissan has been working on a similarly sized sport utility pickup that will combine two of its vehicles that also have a common underbody, the Xterra sport utility vehicle and the Frontier pickup. According to industry consultants, G.M.'s Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac units are  working on combinations of a Suburban sport utility vehicle and a Silverado pickup. G.M. refuses to discuss the vehicles yet for competitive reasons. **********The first sport utility pickup to reach the market will be yet another Ford Motor product, the Lincoln Blackwood, a combination of a Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle and an F-150 pickup. The Blackwood, which will come with a wood-lined bed and is expected to sell for $40,000 or more, is scheduled to go on sale later this autumn but is purely a niche vehicle, with Ford only planning to build a few thousand each year. **********By contrast, the Sport Trac is likely to cost closer to $23,000, although no price has been set yet. Ford will market the Sport Trac to men and women in their 30's with outdoor life styles, said Jan Klug, Ford's marketing and advertising manager for Ford brand cars and light trucks, people who, ''want to be able to throw all the stinky stuff in the back and have the people in the front.''"

But it said it had chosen not to disclose the problem until a remedy was ready. **********The Office 2000 flaw is not identical to the one in Office 97 and cannot be exploited in precisely the same way. But as with the Office 97 flaw, an attack could be started using a software component called Jet to execute arbitrary commands hidden in an Office document. **********Separately, Microsoft acknowledged today that there was a bug in its new Internet chat software, ''MSN Messenger,'' that would allow co-workers and others who had access to a person's computer to see a person's E-mail password for the Microsoft's Web-based ''Hotmail'' service. It promised to fix the flaw by week's end. **********Microsoft security bulletins on the Office 97 flaw had explicitly said that Office 2000 users were not vulnerable. Microsoft said it had been concerned about publicizing a security hole that it could not yet plug. **********''Our policy is not to arm malicious coders until a solution is in place,'' said Andrew Dixon, group product manager for Office at Microsoft. ''We wanted to make sure that the information is there before we announced the vulnerability.'' **********While the Jet component is most commonly associated with Office, it is also installed in conjunction with hundreds of other programs written by other companies for Microsoft operating systems, Mr. Dixon said. **********The repair, or patch, which Microsoft said would be released by Friday, is intended to protect users against vulnerabilities in Office 97, Office 2000 or other programs using the Jet component. **********Mr. Dixon said Microsoft would send a security bulletin disclosing the details of both problems to 1.5 million Office users as well as issuing articles with technical details of the problems. The security bulletin and patch will also be posted on the Web at http://officeupdate.microsoft.com. **********Juan Carlos Garcia Cuartango, an engineer in Spain, said he discovered both flaws late last month and immediately informed Microsoft. While Mr. Cuartango decided to post a notice about the Office 97 flaw to an Internet mailing list, he did not publicly disclose the Office 2000 flaw until today, and Microsoft then acknowledged it. **********''I decided to keep this confidential until the patch is published,'' he said today in an interview. **********The flaws are particularly dangerous because Microsoft's Web browser ordinarily ''trusts'' documents from Microsoft Office programs like Word or Excel and opens them without warning the user. Since the security flaws can be exploited from an Office document hidden in an E-mail message, a user reading E-mail on line can inadvertently unleash rogue programs or viruses. **********Two weeks ago, Microsoft addressed the problem by making available a tool that configures the browser to alert the user before opening such documents. **********It has taken the Office team several weeks to come up with a more fundamental solution because the company was concerned that non-Microsoft programs that use the Jet component might no longer work once the patch was installed. **********''We wanted to make sure it didn't produce incompatibilities,'' Mr. Dixon said. ''We wanted to make sure it's rock solid before introducing it this week.'' **********The Jet component is represented by a Windows file named odbcjt32.dll. Since so many users are vulnerable, experts are advising Microsoft users to download the patch as soon as it is available and to exercise caution when opening unknown Word or Excel documents."

""We will continue to monitor developments in this case closely,"" he said. **********The Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, was quoted by Reuters as saying that Canada would be ""looking very seriously about what kind of action we can take."" **********""The decision of the Malaysian courts is outrageous,"" Mr. Axworthy said. **********Asked about Mr. Clinton's comments, the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad, said that the president was ""entitled to his opinion"" but that he objected to some ""American habits."" **********""I think he is entitled to his opinion,"" he said. ""I'm entitled to mine, and I don't think that arresting Noriega in Panama and bringing him back to trial, by law that Noriega is not normally subject to, is fair either."" General Manuel Antonio Noriega was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 and taken to Florida, where he was tried and convicted in 1992 of drug charges and is serving a 40-year term. **********""I think American habits of arresting other citizens in other countries and bringing them back to trial in America is contrary to international law,"" Mr. Mahathir said, adding, ""I also dislike the continuous bombing of Iraq."" **********Mr. Hiebert's conviction stemmed from an article he wrote about a woman who sued the International School of Kuala Lumpur after her son was kicked off the debating team. The suit was brought by Chandra Sri Ram, the wife of Judge Gopal Sri Ram of the Court of Appeal. **********A judge ruled that Mr. Hiebert's article, which dealt with the growing number of suits in Malaysia, had ""scandalized"" the court and was ""calculated to excite prejudice against the plaintiff."" **********Lawyers for Mr. Hiebert say it is the first time in 50 years that a journalist has been jailed for contempt in any Commonwealth country for press coverage."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/03/technology/state-of-the-art-listening-to-sounds-of-a-wave.html,Joel Brinkley,1999-06-03,"State of the Art column by Joel Brinkley appraises Bose Wave Radio, advertised as 'world's best-sounding radio' and costing from $349 and up, far more than cost of average radio; says nearly all radios Americans purchase now are capable of reprodu...",1234,,The New York Times,Technology,News,article,Listening To Sounds Of a Wave,STATE OF THE ART; Listening To Sounds Of a Wave," **********AMERICANS bought more than 58 million radios for the home last year. In fact, the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association reports that most homes have at least eight of them. If car radios are included, that number rises to 9 or 10 per home,  making radios easily the most ubiquitous consumer electronics device in the nation. **********The average price for the home radios purchased last year was about $17. So  why on earth is the Bose Corporation selling a clock radio for $349 -- or $499 for the model with an integrated CD player? The answer, Bose says, is that it sounds better than other radios -- lots better. In fact, Bose calls it ''the world's best-sounding radio.'' **********It's hard to escape advertisements for the Bose Wave Radio, in magazines and newspapers and on local television -- and of course on the radio, where  Paul Harvey, the pitchman, croons appreciatively about the wonders of this little device. The basic clock radio has been on sale since the summer of 1993; the new version with CD player has been available only since February. **********Curious about whether the Wave Radio sounds good enough to be worth an extra $332 (or an extra $482 for the CD model)? Bose more or less requires you to take it on faith, because for people who do not live near one of the 57 Bose company stores nationwide, the only way to buy a Wave Radio is by phone, mail or over the Internet -- direct from the company. **********''You have to have confidence,'' acknowledged Steve Kingsbury, general manager of direct marketing for Bose. If you're not satisfied, the company allows you to send it back within 30 days. But buying direct from the company insures that the price will really be $349. No Fourth of July discounts, no special deals from mail-order houses. **********Amar Bose, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is the founder and president of the company, said he chose to sell the radio directly because he was certain that high-end audio-video stores would see it as a threat. ''Who wants to show something like this -- a $300 hi-fi system?'' he asked. **********The sale of home radios actually increased by 5 percent last year, suggesting that Americans, by and large, were not convulsed with concern about the quality of the sound pouring forth from the little speakers. **********The explanation seems to be that Americans generally are inured to radios and put them in the same class as refrigerators -- something so taken for granted that you seldom think about it any longer. **********As a result, most people have forgotten, or never knew, that FM radio can actually be a high-fidelity source, capable of reproducing music with nearly the sonic range, or frequency response, of a compact disk. They have forgotten, or never knew, because nearly all of the radios Americans purchased last year and over the previous few decades were capable of reproducing only a narrow slice of this musical range. So to many people, the Bose Wave Radio seems like a new product category: a radio that sounds good. And while the Bose radio is not the only one -- Cambridge Soundworks, among others, sells a similar product -- the Wave Radio is probably the best known. **********The Bose Corporation makes high-fidelity speakers, and the company has reveled in producing unconventional products ever since introducing its first product, the Bose 901 speakers in 1968 -- the first successful speaker that projected the music both forward, as traditional speakers do, and against the rear wall to expand the sound field, producing room-filling sound. **********Dr. Bose, an engineer and inventor, has also from the beginning pursued a quest to produce rich, deep bass through engineering, obviating the need for the 12-inch woofers that have traditionally been the minimum prerequisite for satisfying, full-range bass. That has made Bose speakers easier to place in the living room. And that helped lead to the Bose Wave Radio. It produces far deeper bass than its tiny, 2.5-inch speakers ought to be capable of. **********But Dr. Bose said that when he introduced the product, ''I just went on a hunch that people would want something that gives you the full benefits of a hi-fi but be as simple as a refrigerator.'' And in fact, Bose is selling as many of these $349 radios as it can make, hundreds of thousands of them a year. **********Normally speakers that size are able to produce only a narrow swath of sound in the middle of the frequency range, where human voice falls. If voices sound nasal, or tinny, it is largely because the bass frequencies are missing. **********These frequencies are not missing on the Bose Wave Radio. Bose says it has solved the problem by designing a complex, twisting sound baffle that wends around for 27 inches, back and forth, through the body of the small tabletop radio, whose exterior measurements are only about 14 inches wide by 9 inches deep by 4 inches high. Looking at a diagram of this ''wave guide,'' as Bose calls it, brings to mind high-school biology class diagrams of the inner ear. **********The wave guide works the same way a pipe organ does, noted William R. Short, a Bose fellow. It uses a precise volume of air to amplify the vibrations of the speaker cone. The vibrations of the cone vibrate the air in the baffle, too. ''It matches the motion of the air with the motion of the speaker,'' Mr. Short said. **********In practice, the wave guide seems to work. I've had a Wave Radio for review for several weeks, and I've listened to FM radio and to a variety of CD's I already knew to be sonically (as well as musically) pleasing. And the clear, visceral impression is that the music is richer and fuller than anyone would normally expect from a radio, of all things -- especially one this size. **********No, the Wave Radio does not produce thunderous bass that shakes the cabinet doors. On the top end of the spectrum, the high treble that comes from cymbals, bells, triangles and some strings sounds a bit muted. But the truth is, on most home radios you probably wouldn't even know that the high treble was there. And the bass would be a mere suggestion, not an appreciable part of the music. **********Accurate music production is not the result just of frequency response. Most full-range audio systems also play certain frequencies at higher volumes than others, leading to overblown bass or harsh, strident treble. But the Bose radio manages to reproduce fairly smooth sound across the spectrum. I was not able to measure it, but the music sounded relatively uniform -- or ''flat,'' using the jargon of the trade -- from low bass to high treble. **********The result is a radio that sounds quite pleasing -- surprisingly, given its size. It was also able to play at higher volumes than most other small radios, without distortion, or ''clipping,'' from the speakers. **********The Bose Wave radio cannot compete with any serious stereo system with separate speakers and an FM tuner: housing both speakers in one 14-inch cabinet greatly diminishes the stereo effect. But this is a clock radio with all the functions of one, including a snooze button. It is intended primarily for use in the bedroom or the kitchen, where high-quality sound is not usually found. For that, the Wave Radio is quite expensive. But it is also unique and adept."

W. Scripps  & Company, reaped better-than-expected first-quarter profits as advertising revenue grew robustly and newsprint prices fell, the companies said yesterday. **********Scripps, the nation's oldest newspaper chain, led the group with a 28 percent gain on higher ad sales and growth at its cable television channels, Home and Garden TV and the Food Network. Gannett's earnings rose 12 percent, and Dow Jones's advanced 4 percent. **********Newspaper publishers are benefiting as the economy shows no signs of slowing, keeping ad sales strong. A drop in newsprint prices, typically their biggest expense other than labor, also helped. Newsprint prices are expected to drop even more this year, analysts said. **********As recently as the end of last year, publishing companies and analysts expected newsprint prices to remain steady in 1999. Instead, prices fell because of settled labor strikes and excess supply. Prices are down almost 20 percent, to less than $500 a ton, from about $590 in March 1998. **********Still, newspaper publishers' shares have lagged over the last six months on concern about competition from the Internet and that the economy was headed into a slowdown. **********Scripps, based in Cincinnati, said its net income rose to $32 million, or 40 cents a diluted share, compared with $25.1 million, or 31 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Per-share earnings would have been 36 cents with a change in accounting method, the company said. It had been expected to earn 33 cents a share on that basis, according to a poll of seven analysts. **********Scripps, which owns 19 daily newspapers, 9 TV stations and the 2 cable TV networks, said growth was fueled by improved advertising at its newspapers and strength in its cable operations. **********Revenue rose 7.7 percent, to $373.4 million from $346.8 million. **********Shares of Scripps were unchanged at $43.50. **********Gannett, based in Arlington, Va., said net income rose to $178.9 million, or 64 cents a diluted share, compared with profit from operations of $159.2 million, or 56 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Gannett beat the 62-cent average forecast of analysts surveyed by First Call. **********Gannett, which publishes 74 daily newspapers, including USA Today, and operates 21 television stations,  saw strong advertising growth at its newspapers, where profit grew on rising demand for national and classified ads. Ad sales rose 16 percent at USA Today. **********Revenue rose 4 percent, to $1.25 billion from $1.2 billion. **********In the period a year earlier, a gain of $183.6 million, or about 64 cents a share, from the sale of radio stations and its former Multimedia Security Services Inc. unit resulted in net income of $342.8 million, or $1.20 a share. **********Shares of Gannett rose $1.5625, to $64.75. **********Dow Jones said first-quarter profit from operations rose to $40.9 million, or 44 cents a diluted share, compared with a pro-forma $39.5 million, or 40 cents, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. It had been expected to earn 38 cents. **********Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's, said advertising revenue exceeded expectations last month at The Journal. **********Revenue rose 2.7 percent, to $462 million from a pro-forma $449.9 million. **********A gain of $10.6 million, or 12 cents a share, on the sale of part of its minority stake in Optimark Technologies resulted in net income of $51.5 million, or 56 cents a share. **********In the quarter a year earlier, special items resulted in net income of $34.7 million, or 35 cents a share. **********Shares of Dow Jones rose $2.75, to $50.875."

Shareholders of Hoechst will receive 53 percent of Aventis, with the rest going to Rhone-Poulenc's shareholders, the two companies said last month in a statement setting forth their plans. The stock swap will result in one of the world's largest companies engaged in life sciences, a term encompassing drugmaking and biotechnology. Aventis's stock will trade in Frankfurt, Paris and New York. **********Before the merger is completed, Hoechst is expected to spin off Celanese AG, its industrial-chemical operations, by offering Hoechst shareholders one share in Celanese for 10 Hoechst shares. Other planned perks to Hoechst shareholders include a repurchase of 5 percent of its stock and payment of a special dividend. **********Unloading Celanese to concentrate on pharmaceutical and related businesses will make Aventis a more appealing stock to own than the old Hoechst, said Dominic Baker, a manager of European equities at Framlington Group, which has it and Rhone-Poulenc in its portfolios. For one thing, the profitability of the chemical industry rises and falls with the economic cycle, while earnings for drugmakers are generally more stable. **********""The volatility of the chemical side has always been a thorn in their side,"" Mr. Baker said of Hoechst. ""By spinning off the chemical side, they will be much more geared to life sciences."" **********Concentrating on life sciences will also make Aventis more attractive because fund managers tend to look for companies in particular industries, not conglomerates with a range of activities. **********""When I want to buy a pure pharmaceutical company, at the moment I would buy Novartis or Pharmacia & Upjohn,"" he said. ""I wouldn't buy Hoechst."" **********Analysts at Lehman Brothers also believe that Hoechst will be worth more as a drug company and, with the merger almost certain to occur, they have raised their evaluation of the stock from neutral to ""outperform."" Based on valuations of companies with a similar business mix as Aventis will have, the analysts said, Hoechst shares are worth 47 euros, or $50, now and, once Aventis is up and running smoothly, 51 euros. They were trading Friday at 41.70 euros. **********At the start, the running may not be smooth, said David Potts, a fund manager at Investec Guinness Flight, calling the deal ""a marriage made in hell, combining Gallic pride and charm with German efficiency."" He added, ""Given the egos involved, it makes one wonder if they can extract the synergies and value in the company."" **********Aventis will be based in Strasbourg, on the border between the constituent companies' home countries. Even so, it has not been enough of a compromise to keep some German interests from wondering why the base will be in France when Hoechst is the larger partner. **********Having the company on their side of the border apparently is not enough for French officials to give the deal their blessing. They have grumbled menacingly over the possibility of layoffs. **********""One of the key concerns is that a French minister said this is fine as long as there are no job losses in France,"" Mr. Baker said. ""There is still a lot to be finalized. There is a lot of nationalistic pride, and concern that it could get in the way of the merger, but fundamentally it's still an attractive proposition."" **********Mr. Potts is less hopeful. He said that he ""never trusted the management of Rhone-Poulenc."" **********""It was a great fantasy that they would deliver what shareholders want,"" he added."

An elderly man died of exhaustion crossing the border this morning. **********They were the people of Pristina, once an urbane center with a university, coffee houses, cinemas and newspapers. And they told in almost identical accounts -- as other refugees have in previous days -- of the latest Serbian tactics. **********This is what they said. **********In homes throughout the ethnic Albanian neighborhoods that comprised most of the city there was a knock on the door yesterday afternoon. Sometimes it was only one gunman -- from the special police or paramilitary -- with a black ski mask over his face. **********Leave now, they were told. Many were quickly and roughly thrown out of their houses. They were robbed of their money in the process. **********Once in the street, they joined their neighbors in a forced march between lines of masked, uniformed Serbs draped in weaponry. At one point the Serbs videotaped the march. Two days ago, Serbian state television broadcast just such a forced march in Pristina. **********They were split into two groups, one taken to the city's railroad station, the other to a soccer stadium. It was difficult to estimate from the refugees' accounts exactly how many people were involved, but they clearly numbered tens of thousands. One trainload was sent to the Macedonian border. At least three babies were born last night in the railroad station. **********During the night, the refugees said, the Serbs brought in fleets of buses and large trucks, including freezer trucks of the kind used to transport sides of beef. Many refugees spent hours packed into the buses and trucks until they were driven south past burning villages early in the morning and dumped out at the last village, Szhur, to walk the final few miles to the border. **********''You cannot imagine what happened,'' wailed Suzana Krusnigi, collapsing in tears a few steps over the border with her elderly parents. **********''I was watching television, Sky News, and I walked out into the garden and there were three people with black masks and big guns,'' she said. **********''They wanted to kill my mommy,'' she said. ''They said you give me money or I will kill her. I had 550 Deutsche marks hidden in my sock and I gave it to him. **********''They were not policemen. They were criminals Milosevic let out of jail. It is not easy to earn money. But I don't care about the money. They wanted to kill my parents. **********''In every house they broke the doors,'' she said, crying. ''When we went out everyone was in the street walking between men with black masks and big weapons.'' **********She described the forced march and a sleepless night at the railroad station. **********''All Pristina is empty today,'' she said. ''No Albanians. Only Serbs with guns, they all have guns. Can the world see what they are doing?'' **********The long lines of silent, shaken refugees, many crying, stretched all around her. Among the seemingly endless procession of people atop carts pulled by tractors was 98-year-old Shahin Jhabani, stretched motionless on a wheelbarrow, his feet in maroon socks dangling over the wheel. Tucked around him were a few family possessions: a blanket, a pair of women's high heels and a bright child's jacket. **********By 7 o'clock tonight, some 13,000 people had crossed over the border, a process made painfully slow for much of the day by the Albanian authorities' insistence on a new procedure for registering the refugees. **********What they were registering mostly were the refugees' automobiles --  which had been stripped of license plates by the Serbs -- and they issued mimeographed pieces of paper good for a month. **********Late in the afternoon, after pressure from European aid officials and the flood of people on foot, the system quickened somewhat. But in the darkness there were still thousands of people waiting to cross the border,  backed up in a line nearly 10 miles into the Serbian territory. And even as it inched forward, the line lengthened, with people from Pristina and  areas to the north. **********''They exploded something at the main door of our house,'' said one, Ruzhid Morina, 56. ''Four police with masks came in. Their first demand was money. The children were frightened and started to cry. **********''We took only the things we had at hand, two blankets for the kids and a plastic sheet in case it rains,'' he said. ''All this happened in just five minutes, and we were made to leave the house. On both sides of the street were long lines of Serb police in masks and we had to walk between them to the train station.'' **********As the procession passed a movie theater, he said, police officers in a white Opel Cadet cruised alongside, videotaping him. **********After the march and the long night in the train station, Arsim Rahmani, 26, said, he could see from the windows of the bus that there were no ethnic Albanians. ''Our shops were looted,'' he said. ''There were only Serbs, driving our cars.'' **********At the border, many refugees seemed shattered at the thought of all that they had lost. And yet many also experienced a certain relief, like  Mr. Rahmani and his wife, Aferdita, who was three months pregnant. **********''It is not important that now we are poor people,'' she said, leaning close to her husband. ''What is important is now I am not afraid.''"

But this summer, companies have been busy provisioning themselves at the money store. **********Including initial public offerings, common stock issuance between June and the end of August was up 27 percent in dollar terms from the corresponding period last year, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. The amount of debt raised in the last three months is down a bit from a year ago, but the number of issuers is up nearly 5 percent. **********For the next couple of months, chances are that there will still be lots of money-raisers in the public markets. After that, Wall Street expects demand to dry up until sometime after Jan. 1. **********These developments have had an effect on financial markets, and will for the balance of the year. Thomas M. Likovich, managing director and head of United States high-grade credit trading at Merrill Lynch & Company, took some time last week to chat about them. Here are excerpts from the conversation: **********Q. Why have companies been so active in raising money through debt and equity offerings? **********A. There is a decent amount of uncertainty about what is going to happen at year-end, and while we at Merrill Lynch are confident, no one is certain. So it is prudent to minimize the risk, and come to market sooner rather than later. **********By issuing now, companies are hedging against the potential of a lack of liquidity for financings at year-end. If the liquidity isn't there, that could make terms quite punitive. With the millennium coming, satisfying credit and equity needs before year-end is probably a smart thing to do. We have seen quite a bit of supply come to market over the last couple of months. More will be coming over the next two months. **********Q. What sorts of potential horror stories are they trying to avoid? **********A. There are a lot of different scenarios out there, the worst being that there is absolutely no liquidity in the system at all. **********I could see a scenario, unlikely though it may be, where in December a country announces they may have problems with their infrastructure due to Y2K. That sort of an announcement might make people concerned about whether that sort of a shoe could fall over here. **********Now we are not suggesting this is going to happen. But it is prudent to think out all possible scenarios and be prepared for them. **********Over time, we will be getting more and more positive reports that corporations, countries and utilities are in very good shape. The more positive the news is, the greater the confidence in both the equity and fixed-income markets will be. I think that is the likely scenario. **********Q. Have there been any other factors influencing this decision to come to market early? Specifically, has the Fed's decision to raise short-term rates quickened the pace? **********A. Every corporate treasurer has his or her own perspective on what the Fed might or might not do. But I don't see any evidence that people are trying to come through the door to get ahead of further rate increases. **********Q. There have been a number of market participants who have said the heavy issuance of new bonds has put upward pressure on rates, apart from the Fed's actions this year. Do you agree? **********A. The environment has not been terribly friendly for issuers over the last six weeks to two months. It is more expensive to issue debt now than it was two months ago, and the increase in the credit spread is due almost exclusively to the increase of supply. **********Interest rates have moved up because of what the Fed has done already. But due to the heavy supply, rates are one-quarter to one-half a percentage point higher than they would have been otherwise. The supply has had a material impact. **********Q. If debt issuance remains heavy, all other things being equal, will there continue to be upward pressure on interest rates for the next couple of months? And will rates trend lower after that? **********A. It is possible that market interest rates will go up. But we know the supply of new issues will start to slow as the fourth quarter progresses. That bodes well for a much better technical picture as we go forward. **********I think a large segment of investors have raised more cash than normal. As we go through year-end, a lot of that cash will be converted into new investments. **********Q. What stance should individual investors adopt to take advantage of such anomalies? **********A. Depending on what happens, if the market does cheapen significantly it could represent a pretty good opportunity. There were a number of people who took advantage of the opportunities created by the financial crisis in the fall of 1998."

National had returned to profitability in the previous period after five quarters of losses. **********National's strong showing partly results from its exit from the personal computer microprocessor business, where it had been bloodied in the price wars between the Intel Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. But the results also reflect the large portion of the company's revenues that come from analog devices, which are used in cellular telephones, wireless computers and consumer electronics products of all sorts. Analog sales are growing more rapidly than digital sales. **********National's shares closed up $5, or 11 percent, at $51, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********For the quarter, which ended on Nov. 28, National reported earnings of $92 million, or 49 cents a diluted share, in contrast to a loss of $94.4 million in the period a year earlier. Sales were essentially flat at $513.9 million, compared with $510.1 million in last year's second quarter. **********Earnings in the latest quarter included after-tax gains of $28.4 million from the sale of the Cyrix PC processor business, offset partly by an after-tax extraordinary charge of $6.8 million from the early repayment of $259 million in convertible bonds. Excluding these items, earnings were $70.4 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, in the most recent quarter. **********Wall Street expected National to earn 26 cents in the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings. **********''This quarter gets us off to a good start, not only from the overall market robustness but also as a direct result of our strategic positioning and our solid execution on cost initiatives,'' said Brian L. Halla, National's chairman, president and chief executive. ''Bookings, sales and earnings were well up, led by our analog business.'' **********National said analog chip orders in the quarter were up about 60 percent from last year. Orders were particularly strong for chips to manage power supplies and amplify signals, and for those used in wireless applications. The percentage gain in analog orders from the previous quarter was in the mid-teens, it said. **********Though strong analog sales are helping National at present, for the long term the company is promoting its concept of a PC on a chip, which reduces nearly all of the semiconductor components of a personal computer to one chip. Several high-profile companies, including I.B.M. and America Online, have announced devices using the National chip, which could be used in various information and computing appliances."

But a local court in Munich dismissed that defense, ruling that Compuserve could have done more. It sentenced Mr. Somm to two years of probation and fined him 100,000 marks, or about $180,000. A state court in Munich overturned that verdict. Invoking a new multimedia law passed shortly after Mr. Somm had been convicted, the court ruled that Mr. Somm could not have done much more than he did and could not be held responsible. **********Mr. Somm is ''a slave of the parent company,'' said the court's chief judge, Laszlo Ember. Taking note that Mr. Somm had briefly tried to block access to a number of Internet sites, later giving up because the blockade proved unmanageable, Judge Ember said Mr. Somm had done all he could. **********Lawyers for Compuserve in Germany were ecstatic about today's ruling. ''On the eve of the new millennium, the German judiciary has disposed of another explosive waste product,'' said Ulrich Sieber, a law professor who prepared much of Compuserve's defense. Besides exonerating Compuserve in Germany, he said, the decision eliminated a major source of legal uncertainty for the online industry across Germany. **********Though it came as a relief, legal experts said the decision was not entirely unexpected. At the time Mr. Somm was first convicted, in November 1997, the German Parliament had not yet passed a multimedia law that was intended to shield online services from liability for material that simply traveled over their networks. **********The issue is identical to one that has been at the center of heated political debate in the United States: To what extent should a company that provides access to the Internet be held responsible for material that it does not own or control but which flows over its network? **********Germany has been more aggressive than almost any other Western nation in trying to police the Internet. The federal government maintains lists of illegal Web sites, some of which contain pornography and some of which support violent or neo-Nazi activities. **********Mr. Somm, who is Swiss, has since left Compuserve and now runs a small company of his own."

Soar Under New Law,'Innocent Spouse' Claims to I.R.S. Soar Under New Law," **********Loretta TenPass directs each woman who comes to see her in downtown Des Moines to a private room, puts out a box of tissues and listens as the women ''blow off steam and make comments about their spouse, about what a terrible situation it was or why they did what they did.'' **********Most of the women are divorced and are soon drawn back into the tangle of emotions over their broken bonds, desperate to explain or justify what happened, Mrs. TenPass said. Mrs. TenPass is not a marriage counselor. She is an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service. The people to whom she listens -- virtually all of them women -- are hoping to be excused from  taxes they say they owe because their spouse, or former spouse, secretly cheated on their joint return. **********Last year Congress heard testimony from four women who said that years after their husbands left they discovered that the husbands had been cheating on their taxes and that the I.R.S. expected the women to pay huge bills, including interest. In response, Congress made it easier for them not to pay such taxes, as part of the I.R.S. Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. **********The I.R.S. expected no more than 3,000 new ''innocent spouse'' claims in the year or so since then. But more than 45,000 applications, more than 90 percent of them filed by women, have already been logged, 15 times the anticipated number. **********Hundreds of applications arrive each week. And that number may grow because a growing number of lawyers now file an innocent- spouse claim along with divorce papers, either protectively or as a way to bargain for a better settlement against spouses fearful of an audit. **********What is more, the I.R.S. anticipated that most cases were simple enough to be handled by lower-level auditors like Mrs. TenPass, and Congress gave the agency extra money only for such auditors. But it quickly became clear that highly trained revenue agents would be required to sort out the tax liabilities of couples whose lives were once so entwined that they  presented themselves to the Government as one taxpayer. **********In all, the I.R.S. has pulled about 500 auditors -- more than 3 percent of its auditing force -- mostly from the hunt for tax cheating by businesses and wealthier Americans to dig through the detritus of divorce. **********In each of the 33 I.R.S. districts at least one audit group of 10 to 15 auditors was told to stop hunting for tax cheating by companies and high-income individuals and to deal exclusively with innocent-spouse cases. **********Even that was not enough to handle the work, so other revenue agents now find innocent-spouse cases landing on their desks. ''We are putting our tiptop, most educated people on this, when it was supposed to be a clerical function,'' said one longtime revenue officer on Long Island. **********The complexity of innocent-spouse cases requires expertise on subtle issues, including trying to draw out whether the applicant knew about the cheating and is therefore not entitled to relief, said Steve Pyrek, an I.R.S. spokesman. This is to make sure that a couple, even a divorced couple, is not whipsawing the government to evade taxes. **********He noted that one reason for the high level of staffing is that to help taxpayers each case is reviewed to determine if any of the three forms of relief is available, even if the taxpayer applies for only one. The three forms of relief are separate liability for people who are no longer married, separate liability for those still married and discretionary relief, which is granted by the grace of the I.R.S. **********Mr. Pyrek said that a detailed analysis of 1,000 cases was under way ''to identify the different sources of complexity and develop criteria that will enable us to assign them to employees for the most efficient and effective handling.'' **********This reassignment of auditors is one reason that fewer than one in 300 individual tax returns will be audited in the current fiscal year, down from one in 217 two years ago and one in 63 two decades ago. **********The difficulties in handling innocent-spouse cases illustrate how the I.R.S. is struggling to adjust to new rules imposed by Congress and to a new commissioner who emphasizes customer service. **********Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who was a prime sponsor of innocent-spouse relief, said that ''the fact that the number of innocent-spouse cases has increased so dramatically is a demonstration that the I.R.S. is acknowledging this important classification, and working to see that these innocent women are made whole.'' **********He said that until the new law was put into effect a year ago ''countless individuals who could rightfully claim innocent-spouse protection were not receiving the treatment and relief they deserved.'' He continued, ''While the I.R.S. must continue to properly implement the new innocent-spouse protections, we can see -- even at this early stage -- that the changes we made have been successful in providing relief to those who, through no fault of their own, were being pursued for debts owed by their ex-spouses.'' **********The new law could not have come too soon for Americans like a 57-year-old school administrator in northern New Jersey who agreed to be identified only by her middle name, Ann. She was married for 22 years to a business consultant who filed several business returns for his enterprises as part of their tax returns. **********The couple were audited in 1986 through 1988, the last years they were together, and the I.R.S. determined that they owed a lot of taxes on his business profits. The I.R.S. pursued the husband unsuccessfully for nearly a decade, then, in 1997, turned its sights on Ann. The agency garnisheed the woman's wages for hundreds of dollars a month. ''Suddenly I had less than $1,000 a month to live on and I was putting my daughter through college,'' she said. **********She said the revenue officer assigned to her case had no sympathy ''because I am educated and articulate, but when it comes to tax law and to the details behind how my former husband arrived at the figures on the tax returns for his business I am illiterate.'' **********The Rutgers Law School's tax clinic persuaded the I.R.S. to lift the garnishment in return for $250 monthly payments, which the woman said she feared would continue for the rest of her life. **********When the I.R.S. law was passed last year she applied for relief. And ''a few weeks ago I got back the $3,000 I had paid and I even got interest on my money.'' **********But while taxpayers like Ann are satisfied, many others see problems with the way the I.R.S. is dealing with the innocent-spouse effort. **********Some lawyers who specialize in divorce and tax issues say the agency is spending too much time on such cases, and in some instances making them needlessly complicated. They say the agency is wasting resources that could be better focused on hunting for tax cheats. **********Investigating innocent-spouse cases can entail lengthy interviews and correspondence with both the person seeking relief and the former spouse. **********Marjorie A. O'Connell, a Washington lawyer who for 17 years has published a monthly update on divorce tax issues for lawyers, said the I.R.S. should accept most cases at face value rather than regarding them skeptically, for several reasons. **********First, the new law says a taxpayer can choose to separate her liability from her spouse's. Second, unless the agency can prove that the individual knew that her former spouse was cheating, which is extremely hard, it must excuse her from the taxes.  ''The standard is not that you should have known, but that you had actual knowledge, which is very difficult for the I.R.S. to prove,'' Ms. O'Connell said. **********Third, she said, the agency's own analysis shows that it will collect only about a penny on the dollar of such old tax debts, making it hardly worth much investigative time. **********In some cases the costs of investigation outweigh the dollars involved. The I.R.S. has not disclosed statistics on the average amount involved in innocent-spouse claims, but several agents said they thought that $3,000 was a typical amount of tax before penalties and interest. One Long Island tax auditor said she was working a case valued at $400. **********Ms. O'Connell called formerly married women ''the best customers the I.R.S. has,'' adding that ''They work for wages, keep bank accounts and don't hide from the I.R.S.'' Yet, she said, they are still treated as suspected tax cheats by many revenue agents, a sign, she said, that the drive by Charles O. Rossotti, the  I.R.S. commissioner, to make the tax agency customer friendly has a way to go. **********And the agency's decision thoroughly to investigate innocent-spouse cases has an unintended side effect that undercuts its new focus on customer service, agents say. **********''There was no reduction in my case inventory when they added these innocent-spouse cases,'' said another revenue agent on Long Island, who, like most of those interviewed, insisted on not being identified. ''So that means I have to tell people who are in examination that I will get back to them later. That means you are going to owe more in interest'' if the audit results in a bigger tax bill, as 85 percent do, ''which is going to make some people very unhappy if they figure this out.'' **********The new law also makes life easier for people whose spouses cheated than for people whose spouses merely did not pay taxes owed. Under the law a person whose spouse did not pay the taxes has no specific entitlement for relief and must instead rely on the grace of I.R.S. officials to dismiss the tax. If the spouse cheated on the return, however, then the ex-partner is specifically entitled to get out of the taxes due."

Some of these still use technology developed when Dwight D. Eisenhower was in the White House. The I.R.S. must also process 124 million individual tax returns and millions of corporate and other returns so that it will be ready for the year 2000. **********At the same time, I.R.S. executives are trying to reorganize a bureaucracy with 110,000 employees and change its culture from one of deep suspicion of taxpayers to one dedicated to helping them comply with increasingly complex tax laws. **********If things go badly, Americans can expect all sorts of foul-ups, like lost tax returns or an occasional anticipated refund check emerging from I.R.S. computers as a demand for millions in additional taxes. **********''If there is a bad filing season, it will be the upcoming one, because this is the period when the service has to test whether they are going to be Y2K-compliant,'' said Michael Murphy, a former senior I.R.S. official who is executive director of the Tax Executives Institute, a Washington organization for corporate tax officials. ''If they can't demonstrate it in this filing season, they are going to have difficulties in the next one.'' **********Charles O. Rossotti, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, said, ''Our task is like changing the engines in the plane while you are still flying.'' **********In the real world, such a situation would virtually assure a disastrous crash. But Mr. Rossotti said that while he anticipated there would be some unusual and unexpected problems for taxpayers, there should not be many, and only a few people should be affected. ''It shouldn't be too bad,'' he said, ''but people need to understand that 1999 really is going to be the risky year for us, not the year 2000.'' **********Among Government agencies that could experience disasters because of Year 2000 problems, none faces a bigger challenge than the I.R.S., which still uses huge reels of magnetic tape, rather than modern disk systems, to store and process data. **********Mr. Rossotti likens the main I.R.S. data center in Martinsburg, W. Va., to a living museum of early computer technology. **********Today, the Martinsburg center's relics of data-processing past operate in a tenuous electronic marriage with highly complex data bases that are supposed to link each section of the tax code, each regulation, and each schedule of taxes, penalties and interest to the appropriate lines on thousands of different tax forms -- those completed by taxpayers and those used by the I.R.S. to generate notices. A big concern is that with the complications introduced by reprogramming, this marriage might become a communications problem that would thrust taxpayers into a nightmare of bizarre notices and demands or into a void where their information would vanish. **********Groups like the National Association of Enrolled Agents have alerted their members to be on the watch for bogus notices and to send them on to its national headquarters in Washington. Joseph Lane, an enrolled agent in Bellevue, Wash., who serves on a national advisory panel for the I.R.S., said, ''Tax practitioners are all geared to watch for indications of programming glitches, such as oddball notices saying 'You owe $35 million,' and we have an early warning identification system.'' **********Mr. Lane said he expected few problems, however. ''So far as I know, they have done enough systems-acceptability testing.'' **********To process the torrent of tax returns each spring, the I.R.S. operates 10 paper-pushing factories around the country, commonly known as the Pipeline. In these sprawling complexes, clerks open letters, sort the returns, assign numbers to track the documents, enter most of the data from the returns into computers and then review the results for accuracy before deciding which returns need immediate attention and which can be boxed for storage. **********The Pipeline is from an era when department stores had wooden floors and charge slips were rolled up and put in metal canisters that were moved by wire-and-pulley systems to clerks on other floors. **********In 1985, part of the Pipeline, the I.R.S. Philadelphia Service Center, suffered a breakdown, brought on in part by inadequate computer systems. Some employees ended up shredding some tax returns and putting others in the trash so that they could appear to be meeting work quotas. **********Representative Steve R. Horn, Republican of California, has been holding hearings on the Administration's progress in dealing with Year 2000 issues. He gave the Treasury Department, of which the I.R.S. is part, a grade of C in November, up from D-plus 90 days earlier. The I.R.S. was not among 25 individual departments and agencies given report cards, but Mr. Horn singled out the service for praise in its efforts to deal with the problem, saying that Mr. Rossotti, a former computer systems executive, was ''an outstanding commissioner who understands this problem better than others in the Administration'' and was moving the service to ''the cutting edge of technology.'' **********Mr. Rossotti also said that the complex changes Congress had made to the tax code were creating new difficulties for the service's aging computers. He cited new protections for ''innocent spouses'' as a prime example. ''Innocent-spouse relief requires separating the tax liability of spouses,'' he said, ''but our computers are not equipped to deal with proportionate liability.''"

Composite returns for her growth-stock accounts averaged 31.2 percent annually over the three years ended March 31, according to Strong, compared with 28 percent for the S. & P. 500. **********She calls herself a long-term investor and likes companies with projected earnings growth rates that are greater than the market's over the next three years. And while she is willing to pay more for shares of companies with superior earnings estimates, she shies away from those with what she considers ''inflated'' price-to-earnings ratios -- too far above the market average to be justified by future earnings growth. **********''Since the first of the year, I've sort of taken my foot off the accelerator,'' she said. For example, she has stopped adding to her positions in some high-P/E, high-growth stocks, like Microsoft. ''There are many of them that I like,'' she said, ''but I have been waiting to buy them at somewhat better prices.'' And she is quick to sell if a company's earnings fail to fulfill expectations. **********SINCE the fund's inception, Ms. McGrath has kept a position in Worldcom, now MCI Worldcom, in the concentrated, actively managed portion of the fund. ''This is among the best-positioned companies in the telecommunication services industry,'' she said. ''They have put together their own network for full service of voice, data and Internet, and on a worldwide basis.'' **********She said she expects continuing revenue growth of about 18 percent a year for the company, with net profit margins, which are currently negative, improving. She estimated annual earnings growth of 35 percent over the next three years. **********Her first purchase of Worldcom was at $31 a share in July 1997. MCI Worldcom closed at $89.75 on Friday, and she thinks it could hit $115 within a year. **********Ms. McGrath bought Chase Manhattan shares for the actively managed portion of the fund in October 1997 at $60. Chase now trades at $74.3125, ''and I would think a target of around $100 would be reasonable over the next year,'' she said. **********She expects annual earnings growth of about 13 percent over the next three to five years for Chase, which she praises for concentrating on its core financial services business. ''It's a very strong and conservative management that I like,'' she said. ''They'll be careful and not pay too much for an acquisition, and they'll be sure that they have completed the integration of what they have done in the past, not overwhelm themselves with too many acquisitions.'' **********Ms. McGrath is bullish on technology, too. She bought Texas Instruments, the semiconductor giant, at $64 a share in November. It is now at $118.875; her target is $130 in a year. **********In particular, Ms. McGrath is happy that Texas Instruments is not a major competitor in the hotly contested computer chip market and is instead focused on ''digital signal processors,'' chips used widely in wireless telephones, disk drives and communication equipment. Ms. McGrath says the slump in the semiconductor industry is ending. ''We're coming out of that cycle,'' she said.  She estimates earnings growth of 20 percent a year for Texas Instruments in the next two years."

Carty took over as chairman and chief executive of the AMR Corporation in May, he said that his first priority was to improve the bitter labor relations at American Airlines, the country's second-largest carrier, that had developed under his combative predecessor, Robert L. Crandall. Now, Mr. Carty is learning just how big a challenge that is. **********Yesterday, American was forced to cancel 22 percent, or 500, of its 2,250 daily flights as scores of pilots called in sick for the third day in a row. The pilots are angry about American's plans to integrate Reno Air, a small Western carrier it bought in December, into its larger network. **********The dispute has inconvenienced thousands of passengers and threatens to disrupt the coming Presidents' Day holiday weekend, when flights all over the country will be full. But before that happens, Mr. Carty hinted strongly at a news conference yesterday, American would seek a court injunction ordering the pilots to stop their job action. **********That the airline, the nation's second largest, is facing such difficulty came as a surprise to executives at other carriers and to Wall Street analysts. Shares of AMR, American's parent company, fell $2.9375 yesterday to close at $57 on the first day of trading since the disruption began. **********''This should never have happened,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, an industry analyst with Paine Webber in New York. ''Other airlines in the past have worked out pilot-integration issues on much larger mergers without this unnecessary disruption to operations.'' He estimated the impact on on AMR's earnings this quarter around 5 cents a share. **********Mr. Carty expressed dismay yesterday, asserting: ''It is hard for me to believe that this is really about the Reno acquisition. I wish I knew what it was. But I think it is clearly about more than that.'' **********He said that American was willing to reopen talks at any time with the Allied Pilots Association, the independent union that represents American's 9,200 pilots. The union has said the same thing, though no new talks have been scheduled since negotiations broke off on Friday. **********Gregg Overman, an association spokesman, described the disruption yesterday as a ''grass-roots initiative'' that was not being led by the union. **********For the last two weeks, union leaders had debated asking members to refuse to fly overtime if an agreement with the company could not be reached. That would have taken several days before it began seriously affecting American's operations. But after negotiations ended without a resolution on Friday night, scores of pilots apparently took it upon themselves to call in sick beginning Saturday. ''We would really like to see a more collegial and cooperative atmosphere established at American Airlines,'' Mr. Overman said. ''I guess it is fair to say that we look at this negotiation as an opportunity to see where the rubber meets the road, and it doesn't seem to be happening.'' **********Much of the pilots' anger now can be traced back to their abortive strike two years ago, which was ended minutes after it began when President Clinton, exercising executive powers, ordered the pilots back to work. An agreement was later worked out under the auspices of an emergency board appointed by Mr. Clinton, but even though a majority of the pilots voted in favor of it, many thought that it had been imposed on them. **********''There is a feeling that our pilots didn't have the say that they should have in the process,'' Mr. Overman said. **********Since then, several members of a group of hard-line pilots that was instrumental in the rejection of a tentative contract between American and the union that preceded the strike have been elected to the union's 18-member board. **********Reno Air, which has 300 pilots and 25 jets, has been a sensitive subject with the pilots' union because the carrier was founded soon after American scaled back its operations on the West Coast in 1992 and laid off 610 pilots. Reno Air, which pays its pilots roughly half the average salary at American, picked up many of the abandoned routes and entered into a marketing partnership with American. **********Mr. Carty said yesterday that he decided to buy Reno partly to eliminate the pilots' resentment. The acquisition, he added, would allow American pilots to rise to captain's rank faster and would offer new flying opportunities in the West. **********But the pilots say that Mr. Carty's plan to take up to 18 months to integrate Reno into American's operations violates their contract. And they are eager to set a precedent in case American acquires a much larger carrier such as US Airways or Alaska Airlines. **********Mr. Carty said the union's integration proposal would cost $40 million to $50 million more a year, greatly inflating Reno's $124 million purchase price. **********Under the Railway Labor Act of 1934, which governs labor relations in the airline business, job actions such as a partial strike are severely restricted. Mr. Carty implied that he would seek a court order ending the job action if disruptions continued. But it was not clear whether the pilots would continue to call in sick, citing their right under Federal rules not to fly if they do not feel physically fit. **********That does not bode well for happier relations between labor and management at American, but Mr. Carty is still hopeful. ''Our objective is to be the airline with the best labor relations in the industry,'' he said. ''We obviously have some ways to go.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/business/many-media-voices-of-a-few-merged-masters.html,Stephen Labaton,1999-09-12,,1735,,The New York Times,Business Day,An Analysis; News Analysis,article,Many Media Voices of a Few Merged Masters,Many Media Voices of a Few Merged Masters," **********IF the media and telecommunications giants have their way, decades' worth of Federal rules intended to guard the marketplace of ideas may soon fall, all in the name of the Internet. **********In the last few days, top executives from four of the information industries' largest corporations -- Viacom, CBS, AT&T and Mediaone Group -- have asked the Government to give them a break from tight restrictions intended to prevent cable and broadcast television from falling into too few hands. **********The theory behind the rules is that, in allocating a limited spectrum of communications frequencies, the Government must insure that there are enough different voices, opinions and news gatherers to keep its citizens informed. **********Never before has a corporate merger threatened to exceed the current limits on concentration of media ownership. But two of this year's biggest deals -- Viacom's planned acquisition of CBS, announced Tuesday, and AT&T's pending purchase of Mediaone -- cannot be completed without either changes in the rules or significant divestitures. **********Hoping to avoid selling assets that could be combined profitably, top executives of the companies told the Federal Communications Commission last week that the concentration rules are now archaic -- obsolete in an Internet world that unshackles producers of programming from old economic restraints and assures diverse voices and original content. **********''There is no question that that rule is no longer relevant in a broadband Internet world,'' Mel Karmazin, chairman and chief executive of CBS, said of the regulation that would force Viacom and CBS to sell some stations to stay within rules limiting a company to stations serving 35 percent of the nation's homes. **********A remarkably similar position was articulated to challenge the rules governing cable TV systems. To replace regulations left unenforced after an adverse court decision seven years ago, the F.C.C. had been prepared to issue new rules this week, but postponed them for at least a month after fierce lobbying from AT&T. **********''Very significantly, the market has changed,'' said James Cicconi, general counsel and head of government relations for AT&T, which with the Mediaone acquisition will become the nation's largest cable company. ''The Government should now take a look at whether the original rationale of the rule is still valid -- namely, the ability to bottleneck programming.'' **********What is the answer? Has the Internet indeed promoted new and original voices to the point that traditional concerns about diversity of content can be abandoned? Or, despite the easy, low-cost access it provides to a cybermarketplace of ideas, is the Internet quickly being dominated by a handful of big corporations, just like television, radio, the movies and newspapers before it? **********Some critics are concerned that the arguments in favor of media mergers confuse content with delivery -- that while there are many new channels to deliver information, there is remarkably little original information being gathered or produced. **********At bottom, these analysts say, media companies are making claims for a diversity that simply doesn't exist. **********''The same big players are every bit as keen on swallowing the Internet as they have the traditional media,'' said Mark Crispin Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership and a professor of media studies at New York University. ''The consensus is that the Internet is getting less diverse and more homogenized as it becomes more commercial.'' **********Certainly, trends in the older media are hardly reassuring for the Internet. **********The declining number of American newspapers is an old story. Where a half-century ago there were some 2,200 daily newspapers, there are now about 1,500; most cities have only one. **********Radio has fallen on even harder times. While it used to be that many stations in even midsized cities had their own reporters, that has become the rare exception.  Instead, most stations rely on the same handful of national and local news services. Metro Networks, a Houston-based company that supplies traffic, weather and sports reports to about 1,700 radio stations, has lately become a huge new presence in radio news, often supplying coverage to many stations in one market, sometimes with the same reporters appearing on several stations under different names to give the appearance of competing, exclusive reports. In New York, for example, Metro works for 41 stations. **********While the number of television stations has grown sharply, from 96 in 1950 to 1,216 this year, studies show consistently that they give local news short shrift. ''There is actually more local news than there used to be,'' said Janine Jaquet, research director for the Media Ownership Project. ''The flip side is that a lot of this stuff is coming from fewer sources.'' Many stations rely heavily on wire-service offerings, syndicated features and the kind of crime and violence stories that they -- and their competitors -- can cover easily by listening to a police scanner. Other topics, however, may be neglected. **********''A principal accused of child abuse makes the news; general problems in education don't,'' said Paul Klite, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Media Watch, a Colorado organization that studies news content around the nation. **********The television industry points to cable as evidence that new media give rise to new sources of information. C-Span brings live Congressional proceedings into cable subscribers' living rooms, and three 24-hour news and information channels -- CNN, MSNBC and Fox News -- vie for viewers' attention. Moreover, cable systems in a growing number of cities and regions are now offering 24-hour local news channels that some analysts say are bringing original reporting to their areas. **********STILL, some of cable's early promises of diversity have gone largely unfulfilled. In exchange for their local monopolies, for example, many cable companies vowed to serve the public interest by devoting channels to civic-minded topics like local government, education and the arts. But in many cities, critics say, public access programming is mediocre at best. **********''The public access channels on cable are virtually entirely unused,'' said Lawrence Grossman, the former president of both NBC News and PBS, at a Fordham Law School symposium earlier this year on the impact of large media mergers. ''The last I saw, 18 percent of public access education and government channels were being used. And when they are used, they are virtually unwatchable.'' **********Some viewers prefer a camera's unmediated broadcast of a city council meeting to a reporter's filtered account. But analysts say neither public access programming nor cable TV's heated chat-show debates substitute for original investigative reporting, or even the pedestrian but thorough coverage of public affairs once provided by local and national broadcasters. **********''What you've got is a huge diminution of the number of voices providing information that is necessary for an informed citizenship, and the Internet doesn't change that,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a Washington group that promotes diversity on the airwaves. **********''It certainly reduces the barriers to organizing and to discourse. That's important for democracy,'' Mr. Schwartzman said. ''But it's no replacement for journalism and news gathering.'' **********By all accounts, the Internet was supposed to break the mold of the older technologies by offering a vast new array of voices and opinions. And indeed, a rich cast of original content of varying degrees of usefulness now flows from the Internet, from The Onion and Salon to Matt Drudge. **********But while experts are divided over what the Internet may look like in the future, many agree that the most popular Web sites -- all controlled by commercial interests -- are already beginning to look alike. **********''The notion that technology will create competition and new voices, and so we don't have to worry about these companies getting bigger, is false,'' said Robert W. McChesney, a professor of communications at the University of Illinois and author of a new book, ''Rich Media, Poor Democracy'' (University of Illinois Press). **********Mr. McChesney contends that powerful economic forces will inevitably lead to the domination of information on the Internet by today's media giants. **********First, he said, because they have the newsrooms and production studios, the big media companies already control the means of producing the Internet's content. Even wealthy companies like Microsoft, he noted, have found it difficult to compete. **********Second, Mr. McChesney said, established media companies already have both brand names to attract viewers and relationships with advertisers. **********Finally, it is the established companies, he said, not the start-ups, that have the wherewithal to invest in the Internet for the long term, swallowing heavy losses for a few years in the hope of gaining longer-term profits. **********IN any event, his research shows, about half of the venture capital provided to Internet start-ups is coming from established media companies. So they are likely, he said, to have a big interest in many of the new Internet companies that survive. **********Other experts are more optimistic, seeing the Internet as a powerful forum for diverse and informative voices. **********Andrew L. Shapiro, a senior adviser at the Markle Foundation, has written a book titled ''The Control Revolution: How the Internet Is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know'' (Century Foundation/Public Affairs). **********He points to what happened in December 1996 when Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader, shut down an independent Belgrade radio station, Radio B92, which had regularly broadcast news of protests against his regime. The station rerouted its programming to the Internet, where it was available to computer users in Serbia and around the world. **********''That was an outstanding example of how human rights advocates can use the Internet in ways they could never use television or newspapers to get around a thug like Milosevic,'' Mr. Shapiro said. **********''It's certainly true that a lot of things that happened with cable, television, and radio -- that have led to the dumbing-down of content -- are now happening on the portal sites. But I'm still optimistic. A lot of it will take steering people to the appropriate content: away from the commercial portals to the more diverse sites.'' **********WHILE there will almost certainly be Congressional hearings on the Viacom-CBS merger, there has been far less hand-wringing among lawmakers about the recent information industry deals than there was even just a decade ago, when the trend of big media mergers began to take off. **********Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who was the only Senator to openly criticize the Viacom-CBS deal for its possible effects on public discourse, said the politicians' silence was a clear reflection of both Washington and media economics. There is no lobby these days for media populism. **********''When you look at the mix of money and politics, it's all on one side,'' Mr. Wellstone said. ''The political dialogue and political imagination is set within a narrow parameter.''"

For that reason, Treasuries had their biggest decline in months yesterday as investors grew concerned that the central bank would indeed raise rates to try to brake the economy's growth. **********The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 11/32, to 97 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.30 percent from 6.20 percent on Monday. **********The surge in the yield of the long bond was the largest since August, as buyers moved to the sidelines amid concern that strong holiday retail sales would bolster fourth-quarter growth and help build inflationary pressure, increasing the odds that the Fed would soon raise rates. **********''Clues of budding wage pressures and potential labor strife are beginning to build,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, ''and with gas prices at the pump continuing to rise amid surging economic growth, the specter of rising inflationary expectations down the pike is very likely to translate into higher bond yields.'' **********Mr. Fine said these concerns had not gone unnoticed by the Fed. While the central bank is expected to leave short-term rates alone at its next policy meeting on Dec. 21 to avoid rocking the boat during the Year 2000 transition period, he said, another increase is expected during the first quarter unless there is evidence of a slackening economy. **********In addition, long-term interest rates could come under pressure as the year unfolds, and could weaken stock prices. **********Treasuries fell yesterday after the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in November. Combined with upward revisions in previous months and reports of busy Christmas shopping nationwide, the report suggested that consumer spending remained extremely strong. **********Also leading the bond selloff were investors' liquidating their long positions before the end of the year. Although such selling was relatively small in size, such volume allowed it to cause large swings in prices, traders said. **********Sherry Cooper, chief economist for Nesbitt Burns Securities, said early reports suggested no let-up in personal spending in December. ''The trend in consumer spending remains too hot for the bond market's liking,'' she said. ''Retailers have entered the critical Christmas shopping season with considerable momentum.'' **********''The bottom line,'' Ms. Cooper added, ''is that on balance, the pervasive strength in retail sales outweighs the good news on the C.P.I. for bonds, but the mix of a strong consumer and still-tame inflation is positive for stocks.''"

The ship had been taken over shortly after it left an Indonesian port carrying a cargo of 7,000 metric tons of aluminum ingots. The vessel and its cargo were worth about $20 million **********The tough response by Indian authorities comes as shipping, trading and insurance companies, as well as maritime unions, are becoming increasingly alarmed by a growing number of ship hijackings in the past few years. **********In the past, piracy was largely confined to incidents in which pirates boarded ships, robbing the crew of cash and valuables. There were close to 180 such incidents worldwide in the first nine months of the year, according to the International Maritime Bureau in London. But about 10 outright hijackings have been reported in the Far East and Southeast Asia in the past 18 months, said Pottengal Mukundan, director of the bureau, who estimated the losses at about $100 million **********""Piracy in Southeast Asia is becoming a serious threat to the shipping business,"" said Ryoichi Nakajima, director of Tokyo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd., the shipping company in Tokyo that chartered the Alondra Rainbow. ""Shippers, traders and owners of the goods are all facing a possible increase in transport and insurance costs and, of course, greater risk to the security of crew members."" **********The interception of the hijacked Alondra Rainbow came after the recovery of a Thai tanker, the Siam Xanxai, that was hijacked off the Malaysian coast not far from Singapore on June 8 by 12 armed pirates. **********The Siam Xanxai was found June 17 in the port city of Shantou, in the Chinese province of Guangdong, freshly painted and carrying a cargo of 2,000 metric tons of diesel fuel, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The tanker docked in Bangkok a few days ago after being returned by China. **********The pirates, who set the crew adrift in a small boat, were arrested by Chinese authorities and later identified as Indonesians. The 17 Thai crew members were rescued near the coast of Indonesia. The suspects have been charged with smuggling, which carries the death penalty in China. **********The Alondra Rainbow left the Indonesian port of Kuala Tanjong on the busy Malacca Strait on Oct. 22, bound for Miike in Japan. Shortly after leaving port, the freighter was boarded by masked pirates armed with guns and long-bladed parang knives, crew members said. **********On Oct. 29, after a new name had been painted on the freighter, the hijackers cast the crew of two Japanese officers and 15 Filipino seamen adrift on an open raft, leaving them with basic provisions for survival. Thai fishermen rescued the men off the coast of Thailand on Nov. 8. **********Indian naval officers are now questioning the 15 Indonesians who were taken into custody after they tried, unsuccessfully, to burn and scuttle the Alondra Rainbow as the Indian Coast Guard stormed aboard last week. **********""They are fairly hardened pirates and it will take a while before we get anything from them,"" said Commodore Mahendra Taneja, chief of India's western naval command in Bombay. He made it clear that the Indonesians would be prosecuted. **********In September 1998, another Japanese freighter, the Tenyu, carrying 3,000 tons of aluminum ingots from Kuala Tanjong, went missing with 14 crew members on a voyage to South Korea. **********The Tenyu was found three months later at a Chinese port, repainted and operating under a new name. It took five months of investigation by Chinese authorities before the ship was returned in May. Nothing has since been heard of the crew, and none of the hijackers were reported captured or prosecuted. **********The hunt for the Alondra Rainbow was coordinated by the maritime bureau's Piracy Reporting Center in Kuala Lumpur.

Goodrich, the No. 1 American maker of aircraft landing gear, said it would have per-share earnings this year of $3.20 to $3.30. The company was expected to earn $3.50 a share in 1999. Goodrich's restated 1998 earnings were $346.3 million, or $3.07 a share. The company said in November that it would buy Coltec for $2.2 billion. Allied Signal Inc. sued to block the move, which caused Goodrich to incur unexpected legal fees and delayed the transaction's completion by four months.

The United States and Russia have already taken steps to safeguard Russia's nuclear-weapons material and contain damage from a nuclear accident should one occur. **********The latest agreement was signed  without publicity at a ceremony at the Department of Energy on Wednesday night, just hours after cruise missiles began hitting targets in Yugoslavia. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy, toasted each other with champagne. **********The accord was supposed to have been announced at the end of the planned visit by Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, but he aborted his visit en route to Washington on Tuesday after NATO authorized the attacks on Yugoslavia. **********Secretary Richardson said today that the new agreement put the uranium-conversion deal, which was originally signed in 1993 but quickly ran into trouble, ''on solid ground for years to come.'' **********''Russia benefits and America benefits,'' he added, ''and that, more than anything, symbolizes our new relationship. We seek mutual security, not separate advantage.'' **********Deeply in debt and in desperate need of billions of dollars in Western loans, Russia will now be able to sell 500 metric tons of uranium from its nuclear warheads, worth an estimated $12 billion, to the United States Government and energy companies over the next 20 years. **********An Administration official said that under the 1993 agreement, Russia diluted about 30 tons of weapons-grade uranium that was supposed to be sold to the West. But the deal snagged over disputes about the terms of the sale after uranium prices plunged, and Russia stopped diluting the uranium last year. **********Last fall Congress and the Administration agreed to spend $325 million to buy the natural uranium that had accumulated at market prices. The Administration then helped Russia conclude deals with three energy companies -- Cameco of Canada, Cogema of France, and Nukem of Germany. The contacts were signed two days ago, the Administration official said. **********The second part of the new agreement sets up two centers for enhancing nuclear safety in Russia and the United States. The centers, which will cost Washington about $1 million to open and up to $2 million a year when fully operatings, are supposed to enable Russian and American nuclear experts to cooperate in resolving environmental issues associated with managing radioactive waste and decontaminating plants that are taken out of commission. **********The American center will be located at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory in Idaho Falls, the historical home of research reactors and advanced test reactors. A site for the Russian center has not been determined, but it will be in Moscow. **********The third part provides American assistance to help the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry establish a nuclear crisis center similar to the Department of Energy's Emergency Operations Center in Washington. The goal is to assemble experts and resources quickly to help protect people in the event of an accident at a nuclear plant. **********Discussing the decision by Mr. Adamov, the Russian minister, to stay in Washington despite disagreements over the bombing of Yugoslavia, the senior Administration who described the new accord said: ''We've had a lot of ups and downs, politically and economically in our relationship. But we've both kept our eyes on the importance of the shared goal of helping Russia control its nuclear material and know-how.''"

Michigan State University in East Lansing is embarking on the project -- called the National Gallery of the Spoken Word -- with $3.6 million from the National Science Foundation. The gallery will be an archive of recordings, including Presidential speeches and voices captured on the first Edison cylinders. Nonprofit organizations, museums and universities are helping to stock the archive, which is available at www.ngsw.org. **********The creation of technology and software for searching sounds will underpin the project, said Dr. Mark L.

Deller Jr. at Michigan State University, are leading the effort to create the searching software. The database is expected to contain more than 5,000 hours of recordings. But within the next year or two, Dr. Deller said, visitors to the Web site should be able to type basic words to find specific phrases or words. In four or five years, he added, the database will be able to recognize voices. He said a user might ''come up and ask, Who said 'I am not a crook'?'' **********LISA GUERNSEY"

The two countries' foreign, treasury and defense ministers are to hold parallel talks. **********France and Britain first put forward the notion of a joint defense strategy for the European Union at a summit meeting a year ago in St. Malo, on France's Normandy coast. The war in Kosovo this year, where the United States provided most of the NATO airpower that forced the withdrawal of Serbian forces, only brought the issue more to the fore. **********But the summit meeting follows weeks of tension over France's refusal to lift a ban on British beef imposed in 1996 when bovine spongiform encephalapathy, commonly known as ''mad cow disease,'' was linked to a similar fatal, brain-wasting disease in humans. Some 180,000 British cows were found to be infected with mad cow disease. British ranchers then destroyed thousands of cattle in an effort to eliminate the disease from their herds. **********In August, the European Union lifted the ban, saying British beef was now safe for consumption. But the French refused to accept the meat, saying there was new evidence that it was unsafe. The European Union rejected the charges and began legal action against France this month. But negotiations continued. **********If France's food agency approves the new protocol, the country's Socialist-led government is expected to lift the ban quickly. **********In a statement, Britain's agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said, ''The French government asked for, and was given, more information and assurances about measures being carried out to ensure the safety of British beef.'' **********Of the European Union countries, only France and Germany have balked at lifting the ban on British beef."

""Now our resources are strained, so we want to leverage as much as possible on what we have."" **********Participation in International Monetary Fund-led rescue packages across Asia over the past two years has depleted the bank's resources faster than it expected. The bank, which disbursed loans worth more than $6 billion in each of the past two years, has only about $1 billion now remaining to finance lending this year and about $1 billion for next year, officials said. **********The bank's shareholders โ its 57 member nations โ appear unlikely to vote for a substantial capital increase at the annual board meeting this weekend, so bank officials say they need to make the most of their remaining money. **********On Thursday, officials highlighted ways in which the ADB can lend its name to attract risk-averse commercial banks into deals they might otherwise avoid. **********""We really bring much more than just a name,"" Mr. Hovland said. ""We bring confidence, preferred creditor status, regional expertise, as well as a host of immunities and privileges."" **********Variations on possible deals include one whereby the development bank's name is used on all official documents but most of the money is originated from commercial banks and investors. **********While the bank does not guarantee repayment of funds in such an arrangement, deals made by the ADB in member countries enjoy privileges such as tax-free status, exemption from all foreign-exchange restrictions and no restriction on transfer or remittance of funds. **********Another arrangement calls for the bank to partially guarantee repayment of bonds in local currency. **********These options would allow the bank to encourage development projects while committing only a minimum of funds. **********For commercial banks looking to bring funds back into Asia, the Asian Development Bank is often seen as a safe entrance to crisis-hit countries. **********""Our credit committee much more readily accepts a loan with the ADB name on it,"" said Yoshiyuki Toyoda, managing director and chief executive of DKB Asia Ltd., a Japanese bank. ""Without ADB guarantees, there are many countries where we would not lend money."" **********Private-sector participants in the bank's seminar, however, said that governments sometimes make such deals difficult to strike. **********""We have tried to approach the Asian Development Bank about using co-financing structures in the past,"" said Anita Hellstern, vice president for project and export finance at Siemens AG, a German manufacturer. ""But every time it got stuck on government desks"" waiting for approvals or guarantees. ""It was easier to get direct credits or use another project insurance procedure."" **********Although ADB requires sovereign guarantees only for public-sector projects, the bank has never extended a loan instrument without such backing. **********""Introducing these new formulas to member countries has not been easy,"" Mr. Hovland said."

Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation owns 40 percent of B Sky B, Britain's biggest pay-television company. **********But after some initial excitement, Canal Plus stock actually declined slightly amid doubts that European regulators would ever approve such a merger. The talks were reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. **********B Sky B shares ended with a gain of 18.25 pence, or 3.5 percent, to $:5.37, or about $8.66, in London. On the Paris bourse, Canal Plus shares fell 1.2 euros to 293.8 euros, or $323.20,  after rising as much as 5.5 percent. **********''Nobody in the market seriously expects a full merger,'' said Mark Beilby, a media analyst at Deutsche Bank in London. ''But there could be some kind of joint-venturing, particularly in the area of acquiring key rights.'' **********Canal Plus is Europe's biggest pay-television company, with more than 11 million subscribers in France and nine other countries from Italy to Scandinavia. B Sky B is Britain's biggest pay-television company, with seven million subscribers. **********Mr. Murdoch controls a sprawling array of television, movie and publishing companies in the United States and Britain, and he has made several unsuccessful attempts to expand into Continental Europe's pay-television market. **********Earlier this month, Mr. Murdoch abandoned plans to acquire a controlling stake in Telecom Italia S.p.A.'s pay-television unit, Stream Italia. The deal apparently collapsed after the Italian Government passed legislation that prohibits pay-television companies from acquiring the rights to broadcast more than 60 percent of national soccer games. **********Mr. Murdoch nearly invested two years ago in a German digital pay-television venture controlled by the Kirch Group, but got cold feet and pulled out of the deal. **********Neither the News Corporation nor B Sky B would comment on the question of Canal Plus. Soline Delos, a spokeswoman at Canal Plus in Paris, said her company had talks with Mr. Murdoch's group but said they were nothing unusual. **********''We have had conversations with the Murdoch group, as we have with all major audiovisual groups,'' Ms. Delos said. ''Discussions of this type are part of Canal Plus's normal relations with partners and competitors, and they do not call for any special comment.'' **********Analysts and industry executives said a merger between B Sky B and Canal Plus would face a high chance of opposition from European antitrust regulators, who have the authority to stop such deals. **********Karel van Miert, head of the European Commission's competition ministry, blocked the Kirch Group's plans last year to meld its German digital-television service with the popular satellite service called Premier. **********''If he felt strongly enough to block that plan, he would certainly have trouble with plans to merge two big international companies with operations across Europe,'' said one executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********Beyond that, analysts said it would be extremely difficult to decide who would control a merged company. Both Canal Plus and B Sky B have strong managements, and Canal Plus has a particularly complicated structure as a result of its diverse international holdings. Among other things, Canal Plus owns 90 percent of Telepiu, the Italian pay-tv network; 25 percent of Canal Plus Espana; 50 percent of Canal Digital in Scandinavia, and 33 percent of Canal Plus Polska in Poland. **********Mr. Beilby of Deutsche Bank said the two companies might well reach more limited agreements, such as to avoid attacking each other's markets or to team up in acquiring rights to entertainment and sports programming."

The group's officers said that Microsoft had compromised consumer privacy and trust with an identifying number in its Windows 98 operating system that was surreptitiously collecting consumer data. **********But it found no privacy violations involving information collected through the company's site on the World Wide Web. **********''In this case, Truste's certification process covers data that is collected specifically by microsoft.com, a Truste licensed site,'' Truste said in declining to seek an independent audit of Microsoft's practices or to revoke its seal of approval. **********Privacy advocates heavily criticized the decision and the distinction on which it was based. **********''It illustrates the fact that these seals don't deliver the real privacy protection that people want and deserve, and self-regulation is sham regulation,'' said Jason Catlett, president of the Junkbusters Corporation, who filed the complaint with Truste. **********Mr. Catlett called for an immediate investigation of Microsoft by the Federal Trade Commission, saying the Truste decision showed ''that self-regulation has failed for a systemic reason that we can expect to see repeated.'' **********Indeed, the decision was seen as a sticky one for Truste. Microsoft, a premier corporate partner, contributed $100,000 to the group. **********And it comes at time when the United States is involved in intense negotiations to convince the European Union that self-regulation and self-enforcement of data privacy practices are effective enough to meet a stringent new European privacy law that threatens to disrupt electronic commerce between the United States and Europe. **********A key provision of that law prohibits any company doing business in the European Union from transmitting personal data to any country that does not guarantee comparable privacy protection. **********Last week, while a representative of the European Union was in Washington for negotiations, the Better Business Bureau started its own seal program to monitor the posted privacy practices of Web sites. **********Mr. Catlett's complaint, which was sent to Truste on March 12, stemmed from recent reports that the latest version of Microsoft's Windows generates a unique serial number that can gather private information from users even when they request to remain anonymous. **********''In Truste's opinion, the investigation confirmed that the technology 'bug' already acknowledged by Microsoft did transfer hardware ID's to the Microsoft secure server regardless of whether users chose to send this information or not,'' Truste wrote in a statement posted on its Web site yesterday afternoon. ''While this event does not fall within the boundaries of the Truste License Agreement, it did, in Truste's opinion, compromise consumer trust and privacy. **********''Once the company was made aware of what had occurred, it took the necessary action to remedy the problem.'' Microsoft praised Truste for its investigation. **********''I would say that we believe that the system and process in place by Truste worked well here,'' said Tom Pilla, a spokesman for the company, which is based in Redmond, Wash. ''A watchdog complaint was filed. Truste conducted a thorough investigation in keeping with its standard operating procedure. After a thorough review of the facts, it publicly issued its decision.'' **********Mr. Catlett agreed that Truste ''diligently did what they were constitutionally able to do.'' **********But he added: ''By design, that is very little. They did rebuke Microsoft. But they didn't call in an auditor. They haven't caused any consequences for Microsoft other than this rebuke. It really demonstrates that self-regulation is a toothless tiger.''"

It is promoting these changes to the advertisers in a campaign that has a budget of more than $2 million and will run through November. **********And Red Herring, a six-year-old, privately held magazine that focuses on the venture capital and entrepreneurial side of Silicon Valley, is running a $5 million advertising and promotion campaign to heighten awareness of its brand both in the general business community and among media buyers. Besides the magazine, Red Herring runs a Web site, Redherring.com, and a conference business. Ziff-Davis, whose majority owner is the Softbank Corporation of Japan, has an 11 percent stake in Red Herring. **********The 11-year-old PC Computing, whose readers are mostly executives who make technology purchases, is changing the focus of its coverage from computer products to the effect of technology on business. **********Its new campaign, by Bigmouth, an agency in San Francisco, tries to place PC Computing in the same category as more general interest business magazines like Business Week, Forbes and Fortune. **********Through next month, the advertising is appearing in trade publications like Advertising Age and Adweek and through direct mail to existing and potential advertisers. The campaign also includes what Bigmouth calls ''rich E-mail,'' animated E-mail accompanied by music that presents PC Computing's message to media directors and links them to a special Web site that explains the changes in the magazine. **********The advertising is a bold tomato red, the color of PC Computing's logo, and the copy is somewhat cheeky. A three-page ad running in trade publications, for example, says: ''Like Business Week and Inc. would be, if they offered real business solutions. Like Forbes and Wired would be, if they served some practical purpose. The new PC Computing helps managers boost productivity, increase profits, win new customers and, ultimately, make the cover of one of those fancy coffee-table business books.'' **********Todd Spina, the executive creative director of Bigmouth, said, ''We put up the names of the competition to put PC Computing in the same space as Forbes, Fortune and Fast Company and to move them away from PC World.'' **********The campaign for Red Herring, designed by Swirl, another agency in San Francisco, consists of print and radio advertising that will run through December. Some print ads, geared toward advertisers, are appearing in trade publications. Others, intended to attract new readers and Web site visitors, are running in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Economist, Wired and Forbes. **********In addition, four 30-second radio ads are being broadcast in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. **********One print ad, created for prospective subscribers and Web site visitors, says, ''Now that business has been turned on its head, maybe it's time you used ours.'' Another says: ''Even leaders are led. In today's dynamic business world, no one succeeds alone. You need information and insight that translate into real action. You need Red Herring.'' **********Eric Roos, a partner at Swirl, said, ''Everyone's jumped on the Internet bandwagon, but Red Herring built the bandwagon.'' **********''Red Herring is not trendy,'' he added. ''It's not about hype. It provides high-minded, clear business information as it relates to the world of technology.'' **********Linda Kopp, a senior managing editor of Simba Information, a division of Primedia that tracks computer magazines, suggested that Ziff-Davis was refashioning PC Computing because it had recently lost a significant amount of advertising to general business publications. According to Adscope in Eugene, Ore., which follows advertising for high-technology companies, PC Computing's total ad pages fell to 2,625 last year from 3,056 in 1995. Pages are down almost 20 percent for the first nine months of 1999 compared with those in the corresponding period a year earlier. **********''The traditional computer trade press has had a tough time of late attracting advertising pages,'' Ms. Kopp said. ''It's natural for them to look at how to get a piece of the pie that used to be theirs back again.'' **********Michael Hiatt, who is the vice president for media services at Blain Olsen White Gurr Advertising in Salt Lake City and the publishing director of Mediadirector.com, a Web site for media directors with high-technology clients, called PC Computing's ad campaign ''a bit overstated.'' **********''But there is a story for them to tell,'' he added. ''The proof will be in the execution, and in their ability to transcend gizmos, PC's, how fast PC's are.'' **********Sam Whitmore, editor of Mediasurvey.com, an on-line newsletter that tracks technology publications, said Ziff-Davis had no choice but to refocus PC Computing. ''They don't have a title in the hottest part of the publishing business, which talks about new opportunities in the Internet economy,'' he said. ''They're really late to the game.'' **********He also suggested that Red Herring needed to market itself aggressively. If it does not, he warned, it risks ''getting its lunch eaten by everybody from Upside to the new Time publication on technology.''"

Instead, song files are downloaded from the Internet, then transferred, or ''burned,'' onto a standard recordable CD. **********''Because of the Brujo, MP3's are no longer limited to computer speakers,'' said Jennifer Wolfe, the president of Netdrives. The Brujo comes with a remote control. **********Unlike many commercial CD players, which can hold five or more CD's at once, the Brujo has only one disk tray. But because a standard CD can hold more than 11 hours of MP3 music files there should be no concern about disk swapping unless you are playing a regular CD. **********Of course, if you intend to make MP3 CDs, you will need a CD recording drive for your computer. So Netdrives sells a companion product called the Burner, a retransferable CD recorder that works with Macintosh and Wintel computers. **********The devices cost $300 each or $550 when bought together. They are available on the company's Web site at www.netdrives.com.   TIM HILCHEY"

The bombing is meant to persuade him to sign a peace agreement offering the Albanians autonomy, and to accept the presence of a NATO-led force in Kosovo to police that accord. **********But with reports emerging daily about the execution of prominent Albanians -- including Fehmi Agani, a signatory of the proposed peace deal -- and about the eviction of tens of thousands of Albanians from their homes, it is becoming unclear how the Clinton Administration and its allies would justify any accord with the man behind these acts. **********''If even half of what seems to be going on in Kosovo is in fact going on,'' said one State Department official, ''how could we still do a deal with him, even if he comes around? Our quandary is that the demonization of Milosevic is necessary to maintain the air attacks, but each time we denounce him, it's harder to shake hands with him.'' **********Of course, this is not the first time since Yugoslavia began to disintegrate in 1991 that Serbian forces, regular and paramilitary, under Mr. Milosevic's rule have gone on a rampage. Between April and September 1992, close to one million Muslims were driven from their homes in Bosnia by Serbian militiamen armed and backed by Mr. Milosevic, and many thousands were killed. **********That did not stop the West from doing business with Mr. Milosevic. This time, however, the link between the murder and the man appears more immediate, for Kosovo lies within Serbia, and the link has been spelled out with unusual directness by Western leaders. **********Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, in a briefing yesterday, all but called for Mr. Milosevic to be indicted as a war criminal, saying: ''Anyone who carries out atrocities against the civilian population, anyone who gives orders for them to carry it out, or is complicit in those orders' being given, and anyone who fails to prevent such orders or to prevent those orders' being carried out, anyone in any of those categories, is liable to face indictment before the international war crimes tribunal.'' **********The United States has been a little more reticent but has still made clear that it holds Mr. Milosevic responsible for what is happening in Kosovo today. **********''My sense is that there is not the slightest chance of doing business with Milosevic anymore,'' said a senior American diplomat in Europe, ''but we are desperately hoping that there is some other answer. Because if we can't talk to him, we have to defeat him and remove him.'' **********That has always been the appeal of Mr. Milosevic to Washington and the West in general: however distasteful, he offered a potential way out of a military confrontation for which no Western government had any taste. **********When the Clinton Administration first began to deal with him in earnest in early 1995, it did so precisely because it had determined that he offered potentially the most painless, if not the most edifying, way out of the Bosnian war. **********The policy bore fruit at Dayton, Ohio, where Mr. Milosevic signed a peace accord for Bosnia in late 1995, and engagement with him has been at the heart of America's Balkan policy ever since. **********Now, in the light of a Serbian brutality in Kosovo that has been unexpected in its intensity, that policy looks shaky. But the alternatives, officials said, are also generally unappealing. **********One would be the deployment of ground troops to secure Kosovo, stop the killing there and eventually unseat Mr. Milosevic. But as yet, there appears to be no readiness in the Administration or among the American public for such a risky step. It would appear to run counter to the cautious instincts that President Clinton has shown ever since the debacle in Somalia that took 18 American lives in 1993. **********Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said yesterday that the Administration had no intention of introducing ground forces unless there was a peace settlement. **********Another alternative lies in the possibility that the NATO bombing, if sustained, will have an increasingly destabilizing effect on Serbia, leading disaffected elements in the army and elsewhere to move against Mr. Milosevic. **********But some powerful opposition figures, notably Vojislav Seselj, a lawyer and former paramilitary leader in Bosnia, are more extreme in their views than Mr. Milosevic. The United States has looked long and hard in recent years for credible and moderate opposition figures in Serbia, without unearthing many. **********As one official put it, ''The fact is Milosevic seems to have either destroyed or driven out anyone who could form a credible opposition over the past decade.'' **********Some opposition figures like Vuk Draskovic have been co-opted and are now in the Government; others, particularly in the independent media, have been intimidated and silenced. But there have been moments, as with large-scale demonstrations in winter 1996 and earlier in spring 1992, suggesting that a more open, democratic Serbia could exist after Mr. Milosevic. **********For now the United States and its allies seem ready to persist in the policy of trying to construct a Balkan peace around Mr. Milosevic. Mr. Lockhart said yesterday that a planned Russian delegation to Belgrade this week would be welcome if it could influence Mr. Milosevic to embrace peace. **********But what peace, at this stage, would that be? Russia, presumably, would have to find a face-saver for Mr. Milosevic -- perhaps the suggestion that United Nations troops, rather than NATO troops, would police any accord in Kosovo. **********But last month in Rambouillet, France, the Albanians signed on to an accord that called for several precise things -- among them autonomy and a NATO presence to guarantee it. After what has happened in recent days, it appears inconceivable that the Albanians would accept anything short of the letter of that accord. **********Indeed, many political analysts believe that after the wholesale killing and ''ethnic cleansing'' of the past six days, even the Rambouillet accord may look unacceptable to the outraged Albanian community that backed it. ''It is going to be very, very hard to resurrect the deal,'' said Jonathan Eyal, a British foreign policy analyst. **********But Mr. Eyal argued that it was ''still just about tenable'' to talk to Mr. Milosevic and insist on building an agreement around him. **********That, of course, has been Western policy for some time. It has sought to overlook several basic factors -- among them the question of how any ''autonomy'' can exist under what amounts to Mr. Milosevic's repressive political system in Serbia. It has also repeatedly won time for Western governments, without appearing to bring real Balkan stability any closer. **********''For a long time, in the Balkans,'' the State Department official said, ''we have been driven by the search for the lowest-cost way of buying ourselves another week. But we are now in deeper than ever before, and may have to do some fundamental rethinking.''"

It is not the first time church leaders have called for the resignation of Mr. Milosevic, but the strong language of the statement, and the endorsement by the bishops gathered from all over the country, has put the church in unequivocal opposition to the President. **********''We appeal to the presidents of Serbia and Yugoslavia -- if they genuinely do not want to make hostages of their people and their state and lead them to destruction -- to let others lead the people and the country out of this dead end,'' it said. **********The church was pushed to make its appeal because of the ''tragic state into which our people have been brought, primarily in Kosovo but also in the entire country, especially by the recent war and NATO bombing,'' it said. **********It went on to call for a transitional government and early elections, among other changes. ''We support all democratic and patriotic forces in the country and request that urgent changes in the country begin with an interim government and preparations for preliminary elections,'' the statement said. **********The bishops decided, though, that  the head of the church, Patriarch Pavle, should not attend the opposition rally planned for Aug. 19 in Belgrade. Opposition politicians had pressed the church to show its support by attending the multiparty rally. The decision not to attend may be an attempt to accommodate the positions of some bishops who support the government, but it is more likely that it reflects a concern within the church to maintain a certain distance from politics. **********''The Patriarch will not turn up, because we believe a rally is not the place for the expression of the position of the head of our church, and this appeal is a sufficient message for those who want to listen,'' Bishop Artemije, head of the church in Kosovo, told reporters in the town of Nis after the conference."

Eisner. And it brought to a close the glare of publicity that had both distracted and embarrassed two of the most powerful men in the American entertainment industry. **********The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. In his lawsuit, Mr. Katzenberg initially said that Disney owed him at least $250 million in bonuses, but he later raised the figure to $580 million. Disney had already paid him $117 million. Entertainment industry lawyers said that Mr. Katzenberg could eventually receive at least $200 million, including what had already been paid to him. And the settlement might well be far more than that, they said. But Disney executives, as well as Mr. Katzenberg and his lawyer, Bertram Fields, declined to discuss financial details. **********''I'm relieved to be able to close this chapter and put it behind me,''  Mr. Katzenberg said. **********Similarly, Mr. Eisner called the settlement acceptable and said the ''time has come to put this matter behind us and to focus on our new business initiatives.'' **********The courtroom battle involved combatants who had once been friends and who together had built the Disney empire. By all accounts, the reputation of both moguls, as well as their companies, suffered because of the personal attacks and financial disclosures resulting from the lawsuit. **********Mr. Fields confronted Mr. Eisner on the witness stand with evidence that the Disney chief had once said he hated Mr. Katzenberg and had disparaged him as a ''little midget'' and ''the end of my pom-pom.'' Disney, on the other hand, tried to damage Mr. Katzenberg, contending the live-action films made during his reign had lost $231 million -- a point Mr. Katzenberg disputed. **********Even more significant, the public wrangling underscored Mr. Eisner's apparent inability to groom an heir; it is believed that no successor has yet been selected. **********Mr. Katzenberg left Disney in September 1994 after Mr. Eisner, who had heart surgery, declined to name him Disney's No. 2 executive to replace Frank G. Wells, who had died in a helicopter crash in April of that year. Mr. Eisner, who is 57, named Michael Ovitz, a well-known Hollywood agent, as Disney president in late 1995. But Mr. Ovitz was ousted in December 1996, walking away with about $100 million. He recently began a new talent-management company. **********The fact that Mr. Ovitz earned so much money even though his tenure was considered a debacle left Mr. Katzenberg, who filed his initial suit in Los Angeles Superior Court in April 1996, seething and intensified his efforts against Disney. **********''What does all this say about succession at Disney?'' asked one of Hollywood's top lawyers. ''The fact is, Jeffrey was practically groomed from childhood to take over and didn't get it. It's like 'King Lear.' '' **********The bickering had become so intense that in the end, it required two intermediaries who were not directly involved in the dispute to resolve it. The final agreement was shaped over the Fourth of July weekend by David Geffen, Mr. Katzenberg's partner at Dreamworks SKG, the movie studio they founded with Steven Spielberg, and by Stanley Gold, a longtime Disney board member who is close to Mr. Eisner and a longtime business associate of Roy Disney, the Disney board's vice chairman. **********Mr. Geffen and Mr. Gold met at the Geffen home in Malibu, Calif., for less than an hour on Monday and spoke numerous times on the phone on Tuesday before reaching the agreement. Mr. Geffen also declined to discuss the details. ''It's the perfect definition of a settlement,'' he said. ''Both parties felt they didn't get what they wanted. Disney paid more than it wanted, and Jeffrey got less than he wanted.'' **********Why Disney settled now was unclear. But several lawyers not connected to the case speculated that Mr. Eisner was seeking to avoid an appearance next week at the hearing. His first appearance in May proved a public-relations disaster for the Disney chairman, especially when he was confronted with the midget comment. **********Moreover, Mr. Eisner and Disney were placed in a difficult legal and public position because of the lawsuit. Mr. Katzenberg argued that Disney had failed to pay him a large bonus that was called for in his contract. **********Under the bonus plan, Mr. Katzenberg was scheduled to get 2 percent of the profits of movies and television shows created when he was in charge, including the full-length animated features ''Lion King,'' ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''Aladdin,'' as well as gains from Broadway and other theatrical spinoffs, video sales and theme parks and merchandising. To keep Mr. Katzenberg's bonus as low as possible, Disney was almost compelled to low ball the amount of money the company would earn. The agreement reached on Tuesday was calculated using the 2 percent formula, but the figure awarded to Mr. Katzenberg was a fixed sum, lawyers close to the negotiations said. **********The payment to Mr. Katzenberg is not expected to affect Disney's earnings. And Wall Street greeted the announcement with a yawn: Disney closed at $28.0625, up only 12.5 cents. But the legal battle served as a considerable distraction at the highest levels of Disney and Dreamworks. **********''Jeffrey was so distracted that it was drawing attention away from Dreamworks,'' said one lawyer who knows Mr. Katzenberg. Mr. Katzenberg and the top lawyer at Dreamworks, Helene Hahn, sat side by side almost daily at the hearing. **********At the same time, top executives at Disney, including the counsel, Louis Meisinger, and Sanford M. Litvack, a senior vice president, were deeply immersed in the case. ''It's good that it's behind the company,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon, a financial analyst specializing in entertainment at the Siedler Companies. ''Wall Street hates uncertainty. And once the financial impact is buried somewhere in income statements and balance sheets, it'll be good riddance.'' **********''This has been an embarrassing situation to have the personal side of corporate governance so publicly portrayed,'' Mr. Logsdon said."

''For something that costs $20, it's just not worth packing it up, putting some note in it and going to the post office.'' **********What's in store for Web gift-givers and recipients after all the wrapping paper's been stuffed into recycling bags? **********Most reputable online retailers give a consumer 30 days to return a product for a refund, a store credit or an exchange, but the similarities in their ''100 percent satisfaction guarantee'' return policies often end there. **********Although Amazon.com, for example, will grant a full refund, minus the cost of shipping and handling, other online purveyors of CD's, software and consumer electronics will penalize shoppers for opening packages or for not returning items right away. Insight (www.insight.com) and Egghead (www.egghead.com) are two of many retailers that charge restocking fees of 15 to 20 percent on the price of an item, including taxes. Both Insight and Egghead will levy the fee if the product is not returned within 15 days. **********Unless the merchant has sent the wrong item, shipping charges for returned items are always the consumer's responsibility. If the buyer has documentation showing that something was sent by mistake, most retailers will cover the cost of shipping it back. For that reason, it is important to keep a printed confirmation of the order form that the retailer sends via e-mail and to pass it along to the recipient of the gift. **********Debra Martinez, chairwoman of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, advises against purchasing any insurance offered toward the safe delivery of a product. ''If it breaks on the way over, it's their responsibility,'' she said. If the product does arrive damaged, and it was purchased with a credit card, Ms. Martinez said, a consumer may have recourse through the credit card company. **********People who buy and return new PC's and other computer equipment will confront a hurdle in the return process known as the Return Merchandise Authorization number. In most cases, a consumer must call the customer service number listed in the packing materials or on the company's Web site to get an authorization number and attach it to the returned item before sending it back. Consumers must get a Return Merchandise Authorization number before the manufacturer's deadline, which can range from 15 to 90 days from when the product was received. **********The authorization number helps ensure that a merchant is not being sent merchandise bought elsewhere. ''Especially in the consumer electronics industry, merchants have to be careful that people are returning what they say they bought,'' said Richard Chin, a spokesman for Amazon, which now sells computer-related equipment. ''It also allows customer service to understand why it's being sent back.'' **********If a product is defective when it arrives or breaks during use, some electronics companies will offer the customer a refurbished replacement unit. Palm Computing, for example, gives each customer an option: After mailing back a P.D.A., the customer can wait up to several weeks for repairs or can accept a refurbished device as a permanent replacement. **********Regardless of how necessary return authorization numbers are, getting them can be challenging. Some companies make their customer service numbers difficult to locate on their Web sites or, worse, require the buyer to write a letter to customer service to get a Return Merchandise Authorization number. **********The good news for Internet shoppers is that many online clothing and home-furnishings retailers also operate brick-and-mortar storefronts. Banana Republic, Gap, Eddie Bauer and Barnes & Noble will permit customers to return items they bought online at actual retail stores. **********But for those who must ship items for a refund or exchange, the two most viable delivery options are through United Parcel Service and the Postal Service. If the item is sent via U.P.S., the merchant will often enclose a return label that can be attached to the box. The U.P.S. Web site (www.ups.com) is equipped to calculate return charges based on package weights and geographic distances, and shipping tags can be bought with a credit card and printed out. Although the Postal Service has started an electronic merchandise return service called Returns@ease that allows customers to pay for and print out merchant return labels, only Altrec.com, an outdoor clothing and equipment retailer, has signed on to use the system. **********Neither U.P.S. nor the Postal Service Web options provide an easy solution for those who need to return merchandise in large packages from their homes. U.P.S. charges about $10 for each pickup; shipping is an additional charge. Express couriers like Federal Express and Airborne Express will make pickups, but they can charge much more than $50 for pickup and shipping, depending on the shipment's size and weight. And although a Postal Service letter carrier will accept packages for sending out, ''within reason,'' said Robert Anderson, a spokesman for the Postal Service, a more likely situation is that shoppers will draw on their dwindling reserves of holiday cheer and head to post offices themselves."

Farben: A Lingering Relic of the Nazi Years,THE BUSINESS WORLD; I.G. Farben: A Lingering Relic of the Nazi Years," **********GERMANY is still haunted by many ghosts from the dark years of Nazi rule, but few are as enduring or as strange as the specter of I.G. Farben. **********Once the world's biggest chemical conglomerate, I.G. Farben played so important a role in Hitler's war machine and in the Holocaust that it came to be called ''the devil's chemist.'' It manufactured Zyklon B, the gas-chamber poison, among many other products, and its factories exploited more than 35,000 slave laborers, many from Auschwitz. It even built a concentration camp of its own to improve efficiency. **********Allied officials broke up Farben after the war and distributed most of its assets to new companies. The old headquarters, a grim concrete fortress here, was converted into American military offices and is now being turned into university classrooms. **********But I. G. Farben A.G. never disappeared. It survives as a legal entity, kept alive by lawyers and real estate speculators, outlasting the Allied occupation, the Berlin wall and the cold war. **********Though it has been ''in liquidation'' since 1952, its securities are still traded on the Frankfurt exchange. It has offices in a bland yellow building here. And Farben continues to haunt German courts, pursuing billions of dollars' worth of legal claims dating to the twilight of World War II. **********''Fifty years is undoubtedly too long,'' acknowledged Volker Pollehn, a cheerful lawyer who was appointed by a Frankfurt court as one of two new liquidators of the company last October. ''But the law is absolutely clear about our responsibilities, and it doesn't give us much leeway in how we fulfill them.'' **********It wasn't supposed to be this way. Soon after the Allies defeated Germany in 1945, they decided that Farben had acted too villainously during the war to be allowed to remain intact. The company's top scientist, Fritz Termeer, was convicted by the Nuremburg war crimes tribunal of mass murder, slavery and plundering. The most important factories became the basis of three new chemical companies that went on to become international giants in their own right: Bayer, Hoechst and BASF. **********But some loose ends remained, like paying pensions to retired workers and settling with the former company's creditors. So the old parent company became, formally, I.G. Farbenindustrie in Abwicklung -- the last two words mean ''in liquidation.'' Ominously, it was also given the job of pursuing any legitimate claims on behalf of shareholders and creditors of the old giant. **********Few people expected it to last more than a few years. But few people foresaw just how many new twists, odd angles and blind alleys separated it from any final reckoning. Through trial after trial, the legal machinery ground on for decades as Farben's liquidators, creditors and debtors meticulously untangled claims and counterclaims. **********Farben got a new lease on life with German reunification in 1990. West Germans suddenly could file legal claims on property in eastern Germany that had been confiscated under either the Nazi regime or Soviet occupation forces. **********It did not take long for real estate experts to discern that Farben might be poised for a  windfall. The Soviets had seized thousands of acres and dozens of factories from Farben, and under German law, the company had a strong case for reclaiming them. **********FARBEN'S liquidators pursued billions of dollars in such claims, and speculators bid up its shares -- technically liquidation certificates -- from 12 marks to 39 marks. **********But German courts resoundingly rejected the claims. Among other objections, they cited a 1994 German law prohibiting the Government from returning property taken from companies that violated human rights. The company paid about $17 million to former slave laborers in the 1950's, but adamantly refused to recognize further legal responsibility for decades afterward. **********Farben's lawyers turned their sights abroad. They filed claims of $2 billion against UBS, the giant Swiss bank, arguing that in the Nazi era, Farben executives had fraudulently sold to a component of the bank overseas Farben operations that rightfully belonged to Farben shareholders. These claims were also rejected by German courts. **********Because the company had spent so much on lawyers' fees in the two crusades, it began running desperately short of cash.  The court-appointed liquidator at the time,  Gunther Minninger, a Cologne real estate developer, tried to earn a better return on Farben's money by acquiring two apartment buildings instead of investing in more liquid assets like stocks or bonds. Soon, the company could not afford to pay salaries or perform maintenance on the buildings. And Farben's books were so neglected that Dr. Minninger could not put together an annual report for 1997. He sold his stake and resigned last fall. **********Holocaust survivors are furious that the company even exists. Rather than continuing to pursue forlorn ancient claims, they argue that the company should shut down immediately, sell everything and use its remaining money to build a new museum at Auschwitz or to compensate survivors directly. Protesters tried to disrupt Farben's annual meeting in March. **********''They have told us time and again that they would bring this to a close,'' said Hans Frankenthal, who lost his family in Auschwitz and was forced to work at Farben's synthetic rubber plant. Mr. Frankenthal, who is 72 and lives in the German city of Dortmund, has been fighting for 10 years to shut down the company. **********But he will have to wait. The new court-appointed liquidators are convinced that Farben still has rightful claims against UBS. Undeterred by the earlier defeat in court, Mr. Pollehn said he had stumbled onto new evidence that Farben executives arranged a fraudulent sale of all the company's foreign operations to Swiss Bank, which became part of UBS last year. The value of those assets, he said, was now about 4.4 million marks ($2.39 billion). UBS, which agreed with other Swiss banks to settle Holocaust-era claims for $1.5 billion, says it has no intention of paying Farben. **********In a departure from his predecessors, Mr. Pollehn said last month that most of the money from any legal victories would be put in a new fund for former slave laborers, a plan that was approved at the annual meeting but derided by protesters as inadequate. **********''I became involved with this originally because of the legal issues,'' he said in a recent interview at Farben's modest offices. ''But then I became preoccupied with the history. I think we have a chance here to make a historic change.''"

The antennas will receive programming from three satellites that broadcast the satellite-television service offered in the continental United States by DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics, which is itself owned by General Motors. **********Five-inch, high-resolution television screens will be installed on the back of all Jetblue seats, while armrests will be equipped with plugs for headsets as well as volume and channel controls. **********Tom Anderson, Jetblue's director of aircraft programs, said the carrier would offer 24 channels of live programming from DirecTV, plus one channel that will track the plane's route and another that will be used for promotional purposes. With the exception of the safety briefing, all programs will be available from the minute a passenger sits down until the plane arrives at its destination gate. **********No decisions have been made yet about what channels Jetblue will offer; by Federal law, DirecTV can broadcast only cable, not network, television programming in flight. Mr. Anderson also said Jetblue would not censor programming. For example, if a plane crash occurs, Jetblue will not suspend news programs dealing with that. Commercials also will be the same as they are on the ground. **********Jetblue will charge $3 to $5 for its TV service, depending on the length of the flight; payment will be by credit card only. **********Jetblue will be among the first carriers to feature live satellite-television programming. Delta Air Lines used DirecTV on one flight in October 1996 to broadcast the fourth game of the World Series between the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees. John Kennedy, a Delta spokesman, said the airline had no plans to reintroduce the service now or in the immediate future. DirecTV has also been selling its service to private jet owners since last year. **********Mr. Anderson said Jetblue's new system would give travelers more choice in and greater control over entertainment options than they now have. He also said the system occupied less room in an aircraft cabin than others, freeing space both in overhead bins and beneath seats. **********Glenn Latta, Live TV's vice president of operations and corporate development, said his company had signed an agreement with a second United States airline, which he declined to identify, to also offer 24 channels of programming from DirecTV. **********Terry Wiseman, publisher of Airfax, a Seattle-based newsletter on in-flight entertainment, suggested that Jetblue's service would be a test case for the airline industry of live in-flight TV. **********''If it works in the U.S., you might see it go on international routings when international satellite systems are put up,'' he said. **********He also predicted that air travelers who track stocks on in-flight television would call their brokers from their airplane seats to make trades. And he said they would even be able to conduct such transactions on line once planes are equipped, also by satellite, with E-mail and Internet capabilities. **********New Service to Italy **********Air Europe, which is based in Milan, Italy, and 49.9% owned by SAir Group, the parent of Swissair, will begin service on the Pisa-Venice-New York (Kennedy) route July 26. Flights, which will operate every day but Wednesday, will serve fresh pasta, espresso, Italian pastries and ice cream in both economy and business classes. The carrier is offering an introductory round-trip economy-class fare to either Venice or Pisa for $425, with some restrictions, through Sept. 30. **********For What Can Ail You **********Cadogan Guides has published the second edition of ''Bugs, Bites and Bowels,'' a medical book for travelers by Dr. Jane Wilson-Howarth, an expedition doctor and parasitologist. It covers everything from food-related illnesses to skin infections and motion sickness, and contains charts on tropical diseases and data on immunizations. Distributed in the United States by Globe Pequot Press, it costs $9.95."

The president thanked the pope for his pivotal role. The pope replied, ''You, too, played a part.'' **********It was a poignant reunion for two veterans of that tumultuous era. **********The pope's visit is also a milestone in Catholic Church history: It is the first papal visit to the Caucasus and only the second time a pope has set foot in a predominantly Orthodox country in more than 1,000 years. **********The pope, who dreams of reconciling the two Christian churches, came to Georgia to build on the momentum he started in Romania last May, where he held breakthrough joint services with the Orthodox patriarch of Romania. **********This trip, which began in India, has taken a toll on the pope, 79, who shows symptoms of Parkinson's disease. He shivered under stiff winds at a runway arrival ceremony on Monday even after Vatican aides wrapped him in a red cape and formed a phalanx to block the wind. That evening at an Orthodox cathedral, he was so shaky that the patriarch had to help him to the altar. **********His spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, told reporters today that the pope had caught a ''big chill'' on Monday but had no fever, slept well and got up this morning at 5:30. By the time the pope did his last event, a visit to the Church of SS. Peter and Paul, he had rallied enough to make friendly jokes with local nuns. **********John Paul's reception from the Georgian Orthodox Church has been cordial but guarded. There are deep differences between Roman Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church, including the primacy and infallibility claimed by the pope, differences that date to the schism in 1054. Orthodox leaders fear that Catholic missionaries seek to proselytize in their territory. **********Neither Patriarch Ilia II nor his bishops attended the Mass, and church officials had warned their followers that it was against Orthodox canon law to take part in a Roman Catholic service. **********Asked if he thought the two churches had grown closer during the visit, Patriarch Ilia told reporters, ''Georgia and the Vatican are closer but rapprochement between the churches will be decided by all Orthodox faith branches,'' not by the Georgian church alone. **********Today's Mass was a starkly plain service, with tiny red candles lined up on bleachers behind the altar serving as a religious decor. The pope did not flinch when a shepherd in traditional Caucasian costume kneeled and placed a lamb on the floor before Communion. The pope made a sign of the cross over it. **********There were many Orthodox believers at the Mass who showed no remorse for violation of church rules. President Shevardnadze, who was baptized in 1992, was one. Svetlana Chkhvimiani, 23, was another. ''I was very interested in seeing this,'' she explained. ''It's like a wonderful performance.'' **********Mr. Navarro-Valls said the pope was not bothered by the guarded reception. ''We knew the problems before we left Rome,'' he told reporters at the Mass. ''But a door has been opened, and we have to wait and see what happens next.''"

She quietly handed her baby to a policeman, and then started running. Just before she could throw herself into the sea, another policeman caught her. **********Today, on the first anniversary of the crash that killed all 229 people aboard the New York to Geneva flight, about 700 relatives returned here to submit themselves to another calvary of wrenching emotions. **********As a bagpiper played ''Dark Island,'' they buried 27 coffins containing remains in a hillside park. Across St. Margarets Bay, on a bluff of glacial boulders and low bush blueberries, they inaugurated a granite memorial incised, ''They have been joined to the sea and the sky.'' **********Today, in bobbing fishing boats, family members and religious leaders consecrated the crash site, watching as a hovering helicopter dropped a wreath into the waves. Later, some relatives toured a military hangar where the jet's cockpit is being reconstructed from fragments the size of silver dollars. **********Miles Gerety, whose older brother, Pierce, died in the crash, prepared himself for this emotional week by sailing here from Mystic, Conn. His companion was his brother's son, also named Pierce. **********''Last year, it was so messy and painful, just having bits and pieces of loved ones scattered far and away,'' recalled Mr. Gerety, a Stamford, Conn., lawyer who is president of the International Association of Families of Swissair Flight 111, representing relatives of the victims.  ''This week, seeing the memorial put up, seeing the remains buried in a beautiful place, has given people a bit of peace.'' **********Time and again, family members said here that their spirits were buoyed by the kindness of the people of Nova Scotia. On Wednesday, as the motorcade of 26 buses filled with family members made its way down a winding country lane to the memorial site, local residents stood solemnly on their porches, some holding handmade signs inscribed, ''Flight 111, we will always remember.'' **********''That is one of the most touching things I have ever seen,'' said Peggy Coburn of New Jersey, the mother of three young children who lost her husband, Richard, in the crash. **********It was, she said, ''the most profound tragedy of my life.'' **********For a city that buried 121 impoverished victims of the Titanic sinking in 1912, Halifax responded to the Swissair disaster with the quiet understanding of a community whose  lifeblood is still the sea. After watching family members place flowers on seashore rocks last fall, Bob Quinn, a Halifax songwriter, was inspired to write ''Roses on the Rocks.'' **********Andy Arsenault, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police inspector, sang the words, ''When dreams get tossed, we'll share the cost, and lay the roses on the rocks.'' **********His red dress uniform contrasted with the gray memorial, a chunk of quarried granite shaped to look like a boulder split in two. Facing the sea, the two halves cup three stone benches. The memorial, the burial site and the crash site form an equilateral triangle. **********In this bay of lobster fishermen, life has gradually returned to normal as the search area has been reduced from 150 square miles a year ago to 4 square miles today. But, though tourists frolic in warm, shallow water along the beaches, some local residents are reluctant to venture into the water, noting that crash items washed up on the shores as recently as last week. **********Work continues on the investigation, which has already cost $42 million, making it the most expensive in Canadian history. **********While 90 percent of the aircraft has been recovered, only a small part of the cockpit has been found. Fragments recovered from just behind the cockpit door contain drops of molten aluminum alloy, a metal that melts at 1,220 degrees. **********By studying pieces of burned metal, investigators hope to trace the fire to its source. A final report may take two more years, estimated Jim Harris, spokesman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. **********On a parallel track, a Federal judge in Philadelphia, James Giles, is working to consolidate many of the lawsuits in the case, estimated to be about 175. Most of these suits, which are demanding a total of $16 billion,  are lodged against Swissair, Boeing and Delta. Boeing owns McDonnell Douglas, the manufacturer of the plane, an MD-11. Through an arrangement with Swissair, Delta sold tickets to 65 people on the flight. **********Insurance companies for the defendant companies are expected to pay for the human losses. But cargo shippers may have to fall back on their own insurance as Swissair's standard cargo insurance amounts to only $10 a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds. **********A major loss was a Picasso painting, a version of ''Le Peintre,'' valued at $1.5 million. The jet also carried a two-pound package of diamonds, which were also lost."

Their activities will further strain sanctions that the United States imposed independently on Libya two years before the bombing in response to terrorist incidents that forced American oil companies to leave the nation. **********Libya has lost $24 billion in potential revenue since the sanctions were imposed in 1992 and is desperate for investment. Oil income, accounting for 95 percent of the nation's hard-currency earnings, fell more than a third last year as prices for crude touched 12-year lows. That forced Libya to devalue its currency by 18 percent in December. **********''Oil companies will now feel more comfortable in talking with the Libyan Government about potential projects,'' said Mohammed Abduljabbar, a consultant with the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington. ''It will allow Libya to rehabilitate its oil production.'' **********The lifting of United Nations sanctions means international flights to Tripoli could resume and the nation could buy supplies to refurbish oil-export equipment. The European Union has no ban on oil drilling in Libya, but the six-hour drive from Tunisia to Tripoli is a strain that wards off many investors. **********Already, Libya has taken steps to welcome back oil companies that left through the 1980's, a result of the sanctions and threats against foreigners by the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. **********Later this month at a conference in Geneva, the Libyan Oil Minister, Abdallah Salim al-Badri, is expected to conduct the first major round of bidding for oil exploration rights in four years. **********The Oil Minister said last month in Vienna that he had already held talks with United States oil companies about returning. **********''As far as Libya is concerned, they are welcome back,'' he said. ''We already have been in contact with some of our previous partners. We have been contacted by the American oil companies, and we want them to come back to Libya.'' **********With proven reserves of about 30 billion barrels -- almost as much as has been found in the North Sea -- Libya is a prize for the world's oil industry. Lasmo pumps Libyan oil for $5 or so a barrel, about half the cost in Britain. **********The two-year drop in oil prices has made Libya's cheap oil even more attractive. Benchmark Brent crude oil prices, now $14.72 a barrel, are little more than half their 1997 peak price of almost $25. Libyan projects, however, are profitable even if prices slip to less than $10 a barrel. **********''We're looking for more exploration acreage in Libya,'' said Roy Beadle, a spokesman for Lasmo, Britain's second-biggest oil exploration company. ''Our guys have no problem working there, even with the sanctions.'' **********ENI produces about 16 percent of Libya's oil and found the nation's biggest offshore field. The company is seeking clients to support a $3.5 billion investment in new gas production from the Wafa field on Libya's Mediterranean coast and a pipeline under the sea to Italy. **********Others, such as Total S.A. of France, OMV A.G. of Austria, Repsol  S.A. of Spain and Lundin Oil A.B. of Sweden, are also active in Libya. **********''Doing business in Libya would be easier'' without sanctions, said Terance Taylor, assistant director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a policy adviser in London. ''Financing for new projects will be easier to obtain.'' **********Still, the United States companies that withdrew in the early 1980's after sanctions tightened probably will not be back soon. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan told the Occidental Petroleum Corporation and a consortium including USX-Marathon Group, Conoco Inc. and the Amerada Hess Corporation to pull out after Libyans were linked to the bombing of an Egyptian airliner and a German nightclub. **********The Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation withdrew even earlier, in 1982, a year after a United States trade embargo began. And in 1996, Congress tightened sanctions against Iran and Libya, accusing both of financing terrorism. **********If United States sanctions are lifted, Conoco, Hess and Marathon could have a head start on their rivals because about $2 billion of assets -- including seven major oilfields -- has been held in trust by the Libyan Government until sanctions are removed. The group was part of the Oasis Oil Corporation. **********Since 1986, Conoco's share of output from Oasis, about 300 million barrels of oil valued at about $5 billion, has gone to the Libyan Government, said Carlton Adams, a Conoco spokesman. ''We hope to return and resume our operations there once all the sanctions are lifted,'' he said. **********Hess and Marathon did not comment on the issue."

It wants the United States to open a military base there. **********The offer could give the United States its first permanent military presence on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Even if the base does not materialize, the offer suggests that Azerbaijan, where American oil companies have invested billions of dollars, is eager for a military partnership with the United States. But in addition to giving the United States greater influence in the Caspian region, any such partnership might draw the United States into alliances with undemocratic governments. **********Azerbaijan's autocratic President, Heydar Aliyev, returned home today after 13 days in a Turkish military hospital, where he was being treated for what was described as acute bronchitis. In his absence, his chief foreign affairs adviser, Vafa Guluzade, gave interviews asserting that Azerbaijan wants a military protector. **********Mr. Guluzade said he was prompted by evidence that Russia is sending advanced weapons to Armenia, Azerbaijan's neighbor and enemy. According to Western intelligence agencies, the shipments include MIG-29 fighter jets as well as the S-300 radar and antiaircraft system. **********''Azerbaijan is under a big threat from Russia,'' Mr. Guluzade said in an interview. ''They are waiting to use the Armenians to strike against us. I think Turkish and American military bases would be welcomed here. I'm not saying they will be here in 20 minutes, but they will come.'' **********American officials have not received a formal request for the opening of a base in Azerbaijan; it may come when Mr. Aliyev visits Washington later this year. Their initial response might be described as intrigued but cautious. **********''A real American base in Azerbaijan is impractical, especially since there's no direct threat to American interests there or any active enemy to defend against,'' said one military planner. ''If they were to request military assistance or military advisers, that would be a different thing. There would even be the possibility of taking over an old Soviet base and using it as a joint American and Azerbaijani facility.'' **********This would be a formula similar to that for basing United States troops in Turkey. The largest contingent of American soldiers in the region is at Incirlik in southern Turkey, but their base is officially Turkish. **********''That would be the elegant solution to use in Azerbaijan,'' said a Middle Eastern diplomat. ''But however you clothe it, the Russians certainly wouldn't be happy.'' **********Russia considers the Caucasus region, all of which was part of the Soviet Union, as its sphere of influence. It has troops in both Armenia and Georgia and resents Azerbaijan's unwillingness to accept them. Russian leaders are also seeking to persuade Azerbaijan to export the bulk of its oil through a pipeline across Russian territory, rather than choosing a route across Turkey that is favored by the United States. **********Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Armenia and Azerbaijan have become bitter enemies. Russia and Armenia supported a successful uprising by ethnic Armenians in the Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990's, and the enclave is still controlled by ethnic Armenians."

Force to Timor,Indonesia Invites a U.N. Force to Timor," **********Conceding that Indonesian forces had been unable to control the continuing violence in East Timor, President B. J. Habibie capitulated to international pressure today and invited the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force to the troubled territory. **********''Too many people have lost their lives since the beginning of the unrest, lost their homes and security,'' he said in a televised address. ''We cannot wait any longer. We have to stop the suffering and mourning immediately.'' **********He said an international force would have to work hand in hand with Indonesian troops, who appear divided over whether to enforce or undermine their Government's policy of allowing East Timor to choose independence. **********The President's statement is potentially risky for him and may jeopardize his chance of hanging on to his office once a long electoral process concludes in November. **********Exactly when and how any international force would enter the territory was not made clear. But his statement drew praise -- though some caution until the details are known -- from international leaders, who have expressed horror over the campaign of terror and killings since the former Portuguese colony voted on Aug. 30 to separate from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975. **********''This is a great step forward for the people of East Timor, because it's their welfare, their future, their safety, their freedom that this will be all about,'' said Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, who has been one of the foreign leaders most insistent on intervention. **********President Clinton, speaking to reporters in New Zealand, where he is attending a meeting of Asian-Pacific countries, said the United States contribution would be ''limited but important,'' such as providing intelligence reports and communications help. ''All of that would require some presence on the ground in East Timor,'' he said. ''But no one has asked us for any combat troops.'' [Page A7.] **********John Moore, the Defense Minister of Australia, which is spearheading a potential force, said it might take three to five days to deploy once the United Nations and Indonesia worked out details of its mission and organization. Mr. Habibie said his Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, was flying to New York to discuss the details with Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations. **********If the Indonesian military fully supports the foreign presence, Mr. Moore said, a force of about 7,000 foreign troops will be adequate. Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand have said they are ready to take part. **********Mr. Habibie's announcement was greeted with ''absolute jubilation'' among the 1,000 refugees who have been camped inside the besieged United Nations compound in the East Timorese capital of Dili, said a British journalist, Marie Colvin, who is there. **********''They see it as their salvation,'' she said. ''Nobody can stop smiling. They feel like they were under a death sentence for 10 days and that they are now going to live.'' **********Mr. Habibie's announcement today was a humiliating reversal of Indonesia's longtime insistence that as a sovereign nation it would not accept a foreign military presence. **********Mr. Habibie is running for re-election in a parliamentary vote in November but is coming under harsh attack here for allowing the potential loss of what Indonesians consider their 27th province -- although the rest of the world has never recognized its 1975 invasion and annexation of a territory abandoned by the Portuguese in 1974. **********Questions about Mr. Habibie's ability to enforce his policies or command his military are reinforcing a widespread perception that he is an ineffectual leader. **********The introduction of foreign troops onto Indonesian soil is certain to intensify a nationalist backlash, which has already begun. **********Many in the military see this as the most humiliating moment in their history. **********Mr. Habibie made his announcement in Indonesian and English. The Indonesian version included language that seemed intended to try to soften the blow to national pride. **********''I have decided to invite the international peacekeeping force in order to assist us -- together with the Indonesian military, in a cooperative manner -- to restore security to the trouble province,'' he said. **********The unchecked violence in East Timor has also raised questions about insubordination in the military and about the ability of the armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, to enforce the chain of command. **********The President's announcement came one day after General Wiranto visited East Timor and implied that he had lost control of some of his troops there, who he said were emotionally committed to retaining East Timor, where they had fought against separatist guerrillas for 24 years. **********A military policy of arming local militias to try to influence or derail the vote through intimidation may have taken on a life of its own. The introduction last week of five new battalions of Indonesian troops and a declaration of martial law in the territory seemed to have little effect in calming the violence, although Dili was quiet when a top United Nations delegation visited on Saturday. **********That suggested to some of the visitors that the military had the power to turn the violence off and on at will. **********Mr. Habibie alluded to the military's situation in East Timor when he said: ''The Indonesian defense forces tried to stabilize the situation in East Timor since the declaration of martial law on Sept. 7. At the same time, they had to recognize that there are limits to what more they would achieve. ''They have done their utmost in a very complex and complicated situation under very difficult psychological constraints.'' **********Reports continued to emerge of a brutal campaign of killings, arson and forced relocation of thousands of people by the militias in East Timor, a remote territory with a population of 800,000 before the current violence began. **********Some of the killings seemed to be aimed at eliminating the territory's educated class and its social leaders. Priests and nuns in this largely Roman Catholic territory have become targets. So have young men including students, say refugees and aid workers. **********One foreign monitoring group said that on Thursday, militia members aboard the ferry Dobon Solo, traveling from Dili, systematically searched out, killed and dumped into the sea 35 young men who were aboard, most of them students. **********The monitoring group said the report had come from a young man who had hidden inside a box and survived. **********Aid groups and human rights workers said the greatest emerging danger to the people of East Timor was now starvation, which was also the chief cause of the deaths of some 200,000 people during the years of Indonesian occupation. **********Tens of thousands of people have now fled into East Timor's barren mountains. **********One of the main tasks of an international force would be to secure supply lines to feed and save the refugees, who remain under threat -- and periodic attack -- from the militias. **********Mr. Habibie spoke today after holding emergency meetings with military commanders and his Cabinet and after a telephone call informing Secretary General Annan of his decision. **********Under a transition process envisioned in the United Nations plan, agreed to by Indonesia and Portugal in May, the United Nations is to take over administration and security in East Timor once the Indonesian Parliament ratifies its independence at a session later this fall. **********The announcement today accelerates the plan for the deployment of United Nations security forces and appears to amount to a de facto recognition of the vote for independence -- an unambiguous result of 78.5 percent in favor. **********Though East Timor is unique in having a Portuguese, rather than Dutch, colonial background and in having been annexed 25 years after Indonesia became an independent nation, the possibility of its separation is a direct blow to Indonesia's still-tenuous sense of nationhood. It increases concerns about separatist movements in other provinces, particularly Aceh and Irian Jaya. **********Mr. Habibie's Indonesian-language text repeatedly addressed those concerns. **********He emphasized that he was not acting unilaterally but was consulting with other branches of government, he portrayed his policy in East Timor as part of his efforts to lead to greater democracy, legality and stability in Indonesia and he voiced confidence in the wounded military. **********''I can assure you that the military has undertaken its best efforts to resolve an extremely difficult and complicated situation without abandoning its responsibility for the unity and security of the whole country,'' he said."

''I'm a believer that these things happen, but I don't know what actually happened and I shouldn't have conveyed that impression.'' **********As Mr. Krugman beats a hasty retreat from the allegations he made last week against Mr. Soros in the on-line magazine Slate, the episode shows the perils of leveling insider-trading charges against any financier, especially when it involves one of the most well-known members of the very clubby, and very cloistered, world of international finance. **********Insider trading is, of course, extremely hard to prove. Mr. Soros, who declined to comment yesterday, has never been charged with insider trading during more than three decades plying the world's financial markets, most notably as a currency trader. **********A spokesman for Mr. Soros's hedge fund firm, Soros Fund Management, also declined to comment, other than to point out several retractions Mr. Krugman has posted on his personal Web site and to share a letter the firm sent to Slate -- which is owned by the Microsoft Corporation -- requesting that those retractions be noted. **********The brouhaha, which has also erupted in the Brazilian media, began with a sidebar to Mr. Krugman's Feb. 11 Slate column in which the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist wrote that Mr. Soros used information gleaned from a former employee, Arminio Fraga Neto -- who is also the newly appointed Brazilian central bank president -- to successfully speculate in Brazilian bonds. **********''Over the days preceding the appointment of Arminio Fraga Neto, a former fund manager for billionaire speculator George Soros, as president of Brazil's central bank, wild rumors spread through the markets: Brazil was going to default on its debt, close the banks, whatever,'' Mr. Krugman wrote. ''During that time, it turns out, Fraga was negotiating with the Government, meaning he knew that no such plan was being devised. At the same time, Soros was buying up large quantities of Brazilian debt at deep discounts. When the weekend passed the real recovered sharply, partly because Soros was now able to 'squeeze' those who had sold Brazilian debt short.'' **********Mr. Krugman said in yesterday's interview that his sources for the information about Mr. Soros's Brazilian trades were ''E-mails from people in the investment community.'' But Mr. Krugman, who also writes for Fortune magazine, said he had made no attempt to independently verify his sources' contentions, nor did he attempt to seek comment from Mr. Soros or anyone else at Mr. Soros's firm. **********''Clearly, I wish I hadn't done it,'' Mr. Krugman said. ''I didn't think I was breaking a story. It's all been an object lesson in something or other.'' **********Michael Kinsley, the editor of Slate, said his magazine planned to run a letter from Mr. Fraga as well as Mr. Krugman's retractions. **********''I'm not satisfied with the result in this case, but we're satisfied with the processes we have in place here to prevent these things from happening,'' Mr. Kinsley said. ''We're not foolproof but we have a pretty good record of accuracy.'' **********Despite Mr. Krugman's self-described reporting errors, there is little legal recourse for Mr. Soros given his notoriety and protections the press receives under the First Amendment. **********''Soros is a public figure and as a result, if somebody writes something about him that turns out to be false the writer is protected so long as he believed in what he said at the time he wrote the article,'' said Floyd Abrams, a lawyer specializing in the First Amendment. **********It is still not entirely clear what Mr. Soros's financial position was in Brazil  prior to Mr. Fraga's appointment. Yesterday, the firm declined to discuss its trading despite repeated requests to do so. **********Robert Johnson, a former managing director with Soros Funds Management who co-taught an international finance course with Mr. Fraga at Columbia University, said that he was recently assured by several Soros employees that the firm received no inside information from Mr. Fraga. Mr. Johnson said that these employees said that ''they missed opportunities in Brazil'' to make money. **********For his part, Mr. Fraga said he did not disclose to anyone at Mr. Soros's firm that he was negotiating with the Brazilian Government for the central bank position until the day he resigned from the firm. **********Brazil devalued its currency, the real, on Jan. 13, sending it into a free fall from which it has yet to recover and raising concerns about the capabilities of the Brazilian Government's economic team. A week later, on Jan. 20, the New York Federal Reserve convened a breakfast meeting at its offices at the request of the Brazilian Government. **********The Brazilians wanted to speak with a select group of financiers about the prospects for the Brazilian economy, according to a Federal Reserve spokesman. Among those invited to the breakfast were Chase Manhattan's chairman, Walter V. Shipley; J. P. Morgan's chairman, Douglas A. Warner; Citigroup's vice chairman, William Rhodes; Merrill Lynch's chairman, David Komansky, as well as nine other powerful financiers -- and Mr. Soros. **********A few days later, on Jan. 27, Mr. Fraga, a former Brazilian central bank official who was managing an emerging markets fund for the Soros firm, met with Brazilian central bank officials but did not discuss a job, Mr. Fraga said yesterday. **********Mr. Fraga, who said he returned to New York the night of Jan. 28, added that a Brazilian finance ministry official first explored the possibility of the central bank presidency with him on Saturday, Jan. 30. He was formally offered the job the next day and accepted. When he arrived at Mr. Soros's offices on Monday, Feb. 1, Mr. Fraga said he resigned. He said no one at Soros Fund Management knew of the negotiations before then, including Mr. Soros, who was at a financial conference in Davos, Switzerland. Word of Mr. Fraga's appointment was made public the next day. **********''I don't think people should be judged by rumors,'' Mr. Fraga said. ''Krugman wrote something based on rumors and his own imagination.''"

Although the companies said they had not yet determined where they would cut, Union Carbide workers said they felt it was a virtual certainty that operations here would be cut back sharply or even shut down. ''You can only have so many chiefs,'' said Beth Donofrio, 41, an administrative assistant, who said she might take this opportunity for a career change into foot massage. **********To many, Union Carbide was synonymous with the 1984 poisonous gas leak at a company pesticide plant in Bhopal, India. Employees here were drawn closer together as they saw their company's name vilified around the world. ''We felt like survivors,'' said Ginny Chiapel, 47, an associate in the treasurer's office who has worked at the company for 18 years. **********Union Carbide's revenues make it the fourth-largest public company in Fairfield County. The company moved its headquarters here in 1980. It has 850 employees in Danbury, down from a peak of 3,300 in the mid-1980's. About half of the building's 1.3 million square feet have been taken over by other tenants, including divisions that Union Carbide spun off. **********Mayor Gene F. Eriquez said that because of Union Carbide's gradual cutbacks, the city of 68,000 was feeling ''concern, not panic.'' He said he still had hopes for more development on the company's 645 acres, still largely wooded, in part for the same reasons that brought Union Carbide here in the first place: a safe and clean setting just 70 miles northeast of New York City. **********The United Way of Northern Fairfield County, based in Danbury, said it would assist employees of Union Carbide, which is currently the third-largest contributor in annual fund drives. Marty Milkovic, the president of the local United Way, said he was preparing to help arrange counseling, day-care, job-search, mental-health and substance-abuse services for employees who are dismissed. **********Stephen A. Bull, president of the Greater Danbury Chamber of Commerce, said that from Boy and Girl Scouts to schools to housing projects, ''there is hardly a group in the area that doesn't have Union Carbide's fingerprints on it.'' **********''They didn't just write checks,'' he said. ''Their corporate culture encouraged them to sit on the boards and get involved.'' **********Today's developments dismayed David J. Burke, a finance director who has worked for Union Carbide for 18 years. Like some others, he said he was excited about the potential opportunities at the huge new company. But this was mostly a day for looking back. ''People are very dedicated to the name Union Carbide,'' he said."

It's the end of the second millennium; the moon is about to blot out the sun all across a swatch of northern Europe on Aug. 11, and apocalyptic traffic jams are about to make the French sorry they all insist on starting their five-week annual vacations on July 14, the Gallic Fourth of July. **********But France is also the birthplace of Michel de Nostre-Dame, better known as Nostradamus, and he had dire predictions for 1999. **********Nostradamus had dire predictions for just about every year since his death in 1566, at least for those who find ways of reading them into his sometimes Delphic verse -- people like Paco Rabanne, the fashion designer. **********''From mid-July to after the 11th of August,'' Mr. Rabanne told Le Figaro's weekly magazine last month, ''I am recommending to all my friends to stay at least 60 kilometers from the capital.'' **********Nostradamus, by Mr. Rabanne's reading, had foreseen space travel and predicted that the battered Mir space station would crash down onto Paris and leave much of it looking like Hiroshima in 1945. **********In a country where book publishers seem willing to slap out any paperback at all as long as a celebrity's name is on the cover, that was enough to make Mr. Rabanne a best-selling author this year, with a book called ''1999, Fire From the Heavens,'' published by Editions Michel Lafon. **********Since the book was written, though, Russia has decided to keep Mir up in the heavens, at least through next January, so perhaps it will be the fire next time. But with at least 10 books on Nostradamus still on the shelves, Mr. Rabanne's has plenty of company this summer. **********What makes this year especially portentous, and sent Mr. Rabanne into Chicken Little mode, is a Nostradamus quatrain that could be translated from 16th-century French this way: **********In thousand nine-hundred ninety-nine, seven months, **********A king of terror will come from heaven **********To revive the great King of Angouleme, **********Setting Mars to reign before and then. **********According to Jean-Charles de Fontbrune, a Nostradamus scholar, the King of Angouleme originally meant Attila the Hun, whose advance into Gaul in 451 was supposedly stopped near the city of Angouleme in west-central France. **********Nowadays, as Mr. de Fontbrune sees it, the phrase must refer to China, and Mars, the god of war, was much in evidence in Iraq and later Kosovo through the first six months of 1999. **********A horrified frisson went through Paris in May, therefore, when a United States plane mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, an act that threatened to bring China into NATO's war against Yugoslavia -- real Armageddon. **********''Nostradamus predicted it!'' a wealthy real-estate speculator in the tony 16th arrondissement exclaimed in horror, before heading off as Mr. Rabanne recommended to his country house a safe distance from Paris. **********''If by the 30th of June, 'seven months,' President Clinton has not stopped hostilities in Yugoslavia,'' Mr. de Fontbrune warned, ''the Chinese and the Russians are going to intervene.'' **********As it happened, Russia's diplomatic intervention helped persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to accept NATO's conditions -- perhaps Mr. Milosevic knew that Attila the Hun had also razed Belgrade -- and the bombing stopped before ''seven months'' arrived. **********As for whether Mars will reign after this month, you don't have to be Nostradamus to predict that Kosovo will not be humanity's last war. Scholars who take Nostradamus seriously as the historian and poet he was say he sometimes had to write in elliptical terms, because the Renaissance was a capricious and dangerous time. In France people were being massacred by the thousands in religious wars for what was considered blasphemy. **********Seen in this light, the verse about 1999 takes on a quite different meaning. Louis Schlosser, author of a biography of Nostradamus, thought he was referring to 1559, not 1999, and to the death of King Henry II of France that July. **********Roger Prevost, a French scholar, explains it differently.

The agency also wants the three to repay $1.8 million in profits. **********Scott Ginsburg, 46, who lives in Dallas, was not immediately available for comment. Mark and Jordan Ginsburg, who live in Florida, could not be reached either. **********In the suit, the S.E.C. contends that Scott Ginsburg told his brother that EZ Communications, a radio station operator in Virginia, was for sale. Evergreen was among the bidders for EZ. **********In turn, Mark Ginsburg, 48, told his father about the transaction, and the two bought a total of 73,800 EZ Communications shares, the S.E.C. said. American Radio Systems acquired EZ for $655 million in August 1996. **********Mark Ginsburg and Jordan Ginsburg, 74, made a total profit of almost $1.08 million from trading EZ Communications stock, the S.E.C. said in the suit. **********In 1997, Scott Ginsburg again tipped his brother to a pending acquisition, this time a bid that Evergreen was making for Katz Media, the S.E.C. contends. Mark Ginsburg bought 150,000 Katz shares, turning a profit of $729,000, the agency said. **********Evergreen and Chancellor Broadcasting combined to become Chancellor Media in September 1997, with Scott Ginsburg as its chief executive.

He is said to share his father's common touch and is popular within the military, where support for the monarchy is deeply rooted. **********In a public letter to his brother published early today, the King suggested that Prince Hassan's actions had led to his removal. He accused his brother of trying to exert influence over the army, and criticized what he said had been the Prince's opposition to his plans for longterm succession. **********A separate copy of the royal decree, also published today, designated Prince Abdullah as the new Crown Prince with ''all rights and priveleges.'' **********Until less than a week ago, when the King returned from six months of cancer treatment abroad, few in Jordan had doubted that his brother would be next to assume the crown. The change in successors could have more than a ceremonial effect on this tiny country, which has been ruled by King Hussein for 47 years.  Jordan's stability is of concern to its neighbors, from Israel to Iraq.  Among its biggest challenges are the deepening unpopularity of the peace with Israel, signed by the King in 1994 against the wishes of most Jordanians, and widening concerns about the economy, which has been in a crisis for most of the last decade. **********Little is known about Prince Ab dullah, who has not been tested outside the armed forces. Like his father, he attended the British military academy at Sandhurst, England. A biographer, James Lunt, wrote in his 1989 book ''Hussein of Jordan,'' published by Macmillan London, that Prince Abdullah was ''remarkably like his father in character.'' **********On infrequent occasions, Prince Abdullah has served as regent in Jordan, with the power to oversee the country during the absence of senior members of the royal family. But some of his associates have said he has never shown much ambition outside the army. **********The King, who broke the change to his brother only last Friday, signed the decree on Sunday night, Jordanian officials said today. **********In the past, the King had praised  Hassan for his loyalty, so the tone of the letter explaining the reasons for his dismissal was surprising. **********The King criticized what he said had been Prince Hassan's meddling in the army during his own long absence. He also suggested that Prince Hassan had refused to accept that, even if he became King, one of King Hussein's sons should follow him to the throne. **********There was a hint of palace intrigue in the letter, in which the King said he had been prepared to abdicate in favor of his brother after a first bout with cancer in 1992, but had been hurt by criticism directed at his wife and children by Hassan's supporters. **********There was no indication that the change in succession would prompt any challenge. But many Jordanians are grumbling that the King has treated his brother badly. **********Some people close to the King had spread word that the move reflected dissatisfaction with Prince Hassan's performance during the King's absence. Among the allegations was that Prince Hassan's Pakistani-born wife, Princess Sarvath, had already started refurbishing the King's office in anticipation of her husband's ascent. **********Others, however, including some close to Prince Hassan, 51, have pointed instead to the King's concern for posterity. They say they believe that the King's two bouts with cancer have made him conscious of his mortality and kindled a desire to insure that the Hashemite line of succession -- which dates to 1201 -- passes to one of his own sons. **********The King is expected to appoint Prince Hassan to a new post as his deputy, with responsibilities that could include economic and Middle Eastern affairs, Jordanian officials said. But Prince Hassan, a loyal stand-in, was said to have taken news of his demotion badly. Some of his associates have said the Prince might not accept the post. **********King Hussein, who has ruled Jordan since 1952, has proved durable in part because of his self-confidence and charisma, which have endeared him to his people even as he has made decisions they opposed. That has also endeared him to the West, particularly as it has emboldened him to defy public opinion by reaching out to Israel. **********Prince Hassan is a scholarly, Oxford-educated technocrat well versed in economic and foreign affairs and more comfortable in a blazer than in Arab dress. He has always been seen as more remote, which raised doubts about whether he could muster the reservoir of support necessary to make courageous decisions. **********Many who believed that there would be a new heir focused on Prince Hamzeh, 18, the King's eldest son by his current wife, the American-born Queen Noor. **********Prince Hamzeh, who is attending Sandhurst, was at his father's side through most of his recent struggle with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and he is almost universally believed in Jordan to be the King's favorite. **********According to Jordanian officials who would speak only on condition of anonymity, the King gave Prince Hamzeh serious consideration. They said the King concluded that it would be unwise to hand such responsibility to a teen-ager. Still, some of them said they did not discount the possibility that the King might one day make Prince Hamzeh his heir. **********Prince Abdullah bin Hussein was born in Amman on Jan. 30, 1962, to the King and his second wife, Toni Avril Gardiner, an Englishwoman, who was known as Princess Musa. **********For a brief period after his birth, the infant was designated Crown Prince, in keeping with the tradition of succession incorporated into Jordan's Constitution after the Emirate of Transjordan was recognized as a state in 1923, under King Abdullah, grandfather of the current King. **********It was not long, however, before King Hussein decided that it would be more prudent to appoint an older heir. After a series of assassination attempts against him, and growing concern about the stability of the kingdom, the King decided in 1965 that the Crown Prince would be Hassan, then 18, even though that required amending the Constitution. **********The fact that Prince Abdullah's mother was a foreigner, and converted to Islam only upon marriage, has sometimes been seen as a potential obstacle to his becoming King. A more sentimental choice among many Jordanians has been Prince Ali, the King's eldest son by his third wife, Queen Alia, a Palestinian, whom he married shortly after divorcing Princess Musa in 1971. **********Still, Prince Abdullah -- who attended high school at the Deerfield Academy in Illinois, took one-year courses at Oxford and Georgetown Universities, and served for a short time in the British Army -- has in recent years soothed apprehensions that his outlook might be directed abroad. His wife, Princess Rania, whom he married in 1993, is a Palestinian. They have a son, Prince Hussein, and a daughter, Princess Iman."

The Conference Board reported yesterday, for example, that its index of leading economic indicators rose for the sixth straight month in March, and the Government said that conditions in the housing market remained strong. **********''I think the stock market is right to be worried about rising interest rates,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. **********With signs of economic improvement popping up in a number of countries and industries, fixed-income investments may again become competitive with stocks. **********Responding to these changing conditions, Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch & Company, signaled a shift in his group's model portfolio yesterday to 40 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 30 percent cash, from 40 percent stocks, 50 percent bonds and 10 percent cash. **********''This started with an equity call, where we think it is time to start rotating out of large-cap, high-quality growth stocks and move into value and small-cap stocks,'' he said. **********''Some of our profit indicators in those areas are popping up, signalling it is time to move. But value stocks tend to rise when interest rates go up.

The officer, Gen. Momir Talic, could not have expected what happened next: the Austrian police arrested him on charges of crimes against humanity. **********The detention of General Talic, the highest ranking suspect seized so far by the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, did not make the splash of the court's earlier indictment of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, but it was stunning nevertheless. **********Louise Arbour, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, had special reason to be pleased. By sending her arrest warrant to Austria, she had circumvented NATO officials, some of whom knew of the secret indictment of the general, a key commander during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia, but still held meetings with him in Bosnia without arresting him. **********As Mrs. Arbour leaves her post to take a seat on the Supreme Court of Canada on Sept. 15, the general's arrest in Austria also provides a final, dramatic chance to underscore a near obsession: she is convinced that for an international tribunal to function, countries must carry out its edicts. **********In the three years she has held the highly visible and complex office of chief prosecutor at the international tribunals for both the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, Mrs. Arbour, 52, has drawn both wide applause and criticism. But even her critics concede that she has helped transform the institutions, long seen as weak and peripheral, into more credible forces that both law-abiding nations and outlaws must reckon with. **********''When I arrived, there was this perception outside and inside that we had to be really nice to be effective, that we had to beg for witnesses and documents and be quite deferential and polite,'' she recalled in an interview. ''We had to be in this cooperative mode. This struck me as totally incompatible with our mission.'' **********The resolute Mrs. Arbour dropped the deferential mode, reminding governments that United Nations tribunals are not there to practice well-mannered diplomacy but to apply criminal justice. **********The clearest evidence of this new assertiveness was the way she obtained the indictment of President Milosevic this spring during NATO's bombing of his country. Mrs. Arbour has rarely discussed her strategy with outsiders, but in the interview she explained why she had sought the indictment before a peace agreement was reached, even as Western governments feared that it could derail efforts to end the war. **********''I was in a hurry,'' she said. ''I thought we might miss out as peace was being discussed. I thought he might be able to negotiate a deal for his departure.'' **********To gain time, she decided to set aside possible charges of genocide because they would have delayed the process. Such charges can be added later, she said. With the indictment in place, she added, any country that gives asylum to Mr. Milosevic will pay a ''a very high price.'' **********The indictment is now seen as a tribute to the tribunal's firmness. Still, there was a reason for the more cautious approach in the past. While the tribunal has a Security Council mandate to investigate and punish Europe's worst atrocities since World War II and the staggering 1994 genocide in Rwanda, it has no police force to arrest suspects, no arsenal of electronics to gather evidence. **********The courts started off meek, she felt, because they are a curious hybrid, balancing at a ''very uneasy spot'' at the crossroads of international law and criminal law, two systems with very little in common. **********''International law is quintessentially about political interests, the exercise of state power,'' she said. ''International law is the aristocrat of law, practiced by people in limousines being polite. **********''Criminal law is seen as rough, as street stuff with zero intellectual content. It's not about respecting state power. I sensed that to make a breakthrough, we had to shift more into the criminal mode.'' **********She traveled, demanded and cajoled, prodding governments and military commanders into providing more data, including tightly held intelligence. And she did not mind a fight. At the Rwanda tribunal, which is based in Arusha, Tanzania, that meant confronting some staff members with accusations of corruption and mismanagement. **********She crossed swords with the French Defense Minister, Alain Richard, who refused to let French officers testify in The Hague because, he said, the tribunal practiced merely ''theatrical justice.'' While British peacekeeping troops in Bosnia were arresting suspects, French troops were looking the other way.  But France eventually cooperated. **********She continuously denounced Croatia as it kept refusing to arrest indicted suspects and hand over requested documents. **********Her main quarrel, of course, has been with Yugoslavia. The Milosevic Government, which has always poured scorn on the tribunal, last year barred investigators from Kosovo, infuriating Mrs. Arbour. **********At the same time, American human rights groups and government officials complained that her office was too slow, particularly in 1998 as Serbian troops began violently emptying ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo. **********Several American lawyers and human rights groups in fact were uneasy when Mrs. Arbour was appointed. (At the time she was an appeals court judge in Ontario with little experience as a prosecutor.) Some still give her mixed reviews. **********''She is very capable, with a no-nonsense style, but we were very disappointed about her slow response to the Kosovo crisis,'' said Nina Bang-Jensen of the Coalition for International Justice, a Washington-based lawyers group. ''Unfortunately there was bureaucratic inertia.'' **********Ms. Bang-Jensen and others have said timely, aggressive investigations of abuses could have been a deterrent to Serb commanders. **********Prosecutors in The Hague disagree. The only true deterrents, they argue, are not investigations but arrests. Mrs. Arbour said that even before the bombing of Kosovo, as atrocities were reported she quietly visited NATO commanders, urging them to arrest more indictees in Bosnia, including the most wanted, like the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. **********''Evidently they were too busy,'' she said acidly. **********She acknowledges that the indictments of Mr. Milosevic and four top associates resulted in large part from a coincidence of interest between her office and Western governments, which began to provide the necessary intelligence. ''This coincidence did not exist when I asked for information about the chain of command in the Bosnian war,'' she said. **********American and European politicians, in contrast, have begun to use the tribunal as a political weapon, threatening to hold perpetrators of atrocities accountable in The Hague. ''Suddenly we were on everybody's lips,'' said Mrs. Arbour. **********One way Mrs. Arbour made the tribunal more effective was to keep indictments secret to avoid alerting suspects. She also began to focus on the most senior military and political leaders and introduced group trials, in which people in related cases are tried together. **********In The Hague she has dropped charges against 18 people, considering the cases too weak. The Hague has 31 people in custody. Seven trials have been completed. The Rwanda tribunal holds 38 people and has handed down four sentences. **********She said her decision to leave, a year before the end of her mandate, was difficult because she was offered the Supreme Court seat in Canada just as the tribunal was at the height of its involvement in Kosovo. **********''When I realized that I would not do another four years, that I would not renew my mandate next year, it became easier,'' she said. Mrs. Arbour, who has three teen-age children, said she was looking forward to ''a more normal family life.'' **********Looking back on a job that was often frustrating and exhausting, she says that the commitment of governments to the tribunals has become ''firm and clear and generally more bold'' and that the tribunals have set basic standards for a future permanent international court. **********''I think we're moving in the right direction,'' she said. ''I think the fear and paranoia about rogue prosecutors may be subsiding. We are not wild prosecutors, doing wild and irrational things.''"

Yet, while advertising continues to drive revenues, analysts are questioning the portals' ability to sustain growth with a business model that relies heavily on advertising. The obvious answer: grab a piece of the growing E-commerce pie. **********Web merchants like Barnesandnoble.com and CD Now may pay fees as high as $5 million apiece each year to be featured on portal sites. Some say they are not eager to see the potential E-commerce competition from the very Web sites that carry the merchants' customer traffic. **********The situation has created a growing sense of distrust. **********''I just got finished doing a panel at a conference,'' said Michael Baum, vice president for E-commerce at the Go Network, a portal started in January by the Walt Disney Company and Infoseek, which itself is partly owned by Disney. ''I told an audience of merchants that our goal is to empower them, not compete with them,'' said Mr. Baum, who recalled that his reassurances seemed to be well received. ''I must have had 60 merchants come up to me afterward and say, 'Wow, I didn't know that's the way it is.' '' **********Analysts and industry executives say this uneasy phase in the relationship between portals and merchants could lead to a better shopping environment for consumers, if it leads to more choices. But the road to that high ground is strewn with obstacles. **********First, Internet merchants fear that portals will compete with them by selling goods directly to their users, as Lycos, a popular portal, has announced it plans to do. With its pending acquisition by USA Networks, which also owns the Home Shopping Network, Lycos hopes to fulfill orders of goods directly from its own warehouse -- thus potentially circumventing the merchants that pay to be featured on its site. Lycos's featured merchants currently include Eddie Bauer and Etoys. **********Beyond direct competition, however, merchants are concerned that portals will increasingly try to keep consumers on the portal site for most or all of a shopping transaction, rather than direct them to the merchants' sites, as is now typically the case. **********By ''taking more of the transaction,'' as the practice is known, portals rankle retailers in various ways. The portal can capture most of the buyer's personal information -- through a registration process or a credit card form. Merchants fear that the portals will then sell that information to competing retailers, which could then market competing goods to those customers. **********There's another concern. Top-tier Internet retailers go to great lengths to merchandise their goods effectively and implement technological innovations, like offering shoppers a personalized on-line catalogue. The more time shoppers spend on a portal's general commerce area, the less time they have for the personal, brand-enhancing flourishes on the merchant's site. **********E-commerce executives say that America Online has been particularly sensitive to such concerns, by generally ushering customers to the merchant's site early in the shopping process. And in cases where America Online does gather customer information, these executives say, the company pledges to its merchants that it will not let that information fall into the hands of competitors. **********Less sensitive to these issues, many say, is Yahoo, the portal that attracts the most traffic. Though other portals offer shopping channels that prominently feature certain retailers, Yahoo instead offers categories of goods, like outdoor apparel or music. A Yahoo search feature enables shoppers to find and purchase an item from any number of stores that have bought space on the site. On Yahoo, in other words, the product -- not the retailer -- is king. **********Yahoo also keeps shoppers on its site for the entire transaction, so merchants have less control of the data, and the shopper's experience, than they do with other portals. **********Tim Brady, Yahoo's vice president for production, acknowledges the tension such an approach has caused, but stressed that it was meant to help customers find goods they needed, not usurp merchant brands. ''I think it's a healthy tension, and I think that's natural, and there's room for both sides to succeed,'' Mr. Brady said. **********But Marc Johnson, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a research firm, said that this tension could cost portals like Yahoo in the long run. So far, traffic leaders like Yahoo have been able to justify charging merchants millions of dollars to be linked to their sites for the same reason a television network can charge hefty advertising rates for a popular program: because that's where the potential customers are. But if merchants feel that a portal is actually undermining its business, the checkbooks may slam shut. **********''When these portal deals come up for renewal, merchants will look at them much more closely,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''It's not a given anymore that they're going to renew.'' **********Arno Harris, vice president of the on-line retailer 911gifts.com, which has portal deals with America Online and Excite, among others, predicted that the discord between merchants and portals would ''change the strategic landscape'' of Internet shopping. **********''It's easy to get lost by focusing on immediate business needs, but the guiding principle in all of this is delivering the best possible customer experience,'' Mr. Harris said. That experience involves a multitude of merchandising and customer service nuances, he said, adding, ''Portals will never be able to provide that.'' **********For now, though, some merchants are willing to share the wealth with portal sites, if trust is established. Revenue sharing, wherein merchants pay portals a small fee for each transaction generated, is an increasingly common arrangement between portals and their partners, analysts say. **********''If portals are instrumental in making E-commerce run, I'm willing to do a revenue share and to share limited data, if that improves the customer conversion rate and gets more people buying on line,'' said Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of Bluefly.com, a discount apparel merchant, which is featured on several major portals, including Go Network and Lycos. **********''We're all trying to figure this out,'' Mr. Morris said. ''For the most part, the portals have been modest enough to say no one knows the best way to structure E-commerce. The ones that are closed-minded about it are going to fail because they'll lose their merchants.'' **********Mr. Baum, of Go Network, said he was not surprised that some merchants were fearful. ''Any time you see business models collide, as they have on the Internet, people quickly gravitate to fearful rather than a forward-thinking position,'' Mr. Baum said. ''I just don't think that as a whole, portals have done a good job of sending out the message of what we're all about.''"

People close to Telekom said it was unquestionably interested in the British company, though it is unclear that Telekom has made a firm offer. **********Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, said last week that he was actively looking for additional acquisitions after -- or if -- it manages to complete a deal with Telecom Italia. **********One 2 One has yet to turn a profit, and it came under heavy new pressure when its archrival in Britain,  Vodafone Group P.L.C., reached an agreement to acquire Air Touch Communications, the huge American wireless company that was spun off from Pacific Telesis Group several years ago. **********But Telekom is probably not the only company interested in bidding on One 2 One. Executives at Mannesman A.G., which competes against and indeed overtook Telekom in the German cellular telephone market, have said they are looking at a possible bid as well. **********Telecom executives refused to comment publicly today on the reports in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag and in Focus magazine,  dismissing them as ''pure speculation.'' **********But industry executives said Deutsche Telekom would be negligent if it did not seriously look at acquiring One 2 One. Though the company is the smallest of Britain's four cellular carriers, it has a nationwide license and has been growing rapidly. **********Such an acquisition would significantly shore up Telekom's European presence. If the merger with Telecom Italia comes through, the new company will have a strong base in Germany as well as Europe's largest mobile telephone operator, Telecom Italia's mobile subsidiary. **********Deutsche Telekom has a big war chest to finance expansion, and those resources are about to get bigger. The company recently announced plans for a huge new stock offering, possibly worth more than $10 billion, and said the money would be used primarily for ''global expansion.'' **********The merger with Telecom Italia would not interfere with other acquisitions, because the two companies are merely exchanging shares without using up scarce cash or taking on new debt. Indeed, because Telecom Italia has far less debt than its German counterpart, the merged company will have a stronger balance sheet than Telekom itself. **********But Mannesmann could become a formidable opponent. In Germany, its Mobilfunk mobile telephone subsidiary has higher revenues than Telekom's own, older cellular service. **********Telekom executives view the Telecom Italia acquisition largely as a stepping stone to further expansion and consolidation."

They estimate the wealth transfer will be $41 trillion to $136 trillion. **********''It can now be safely said that the forthcoming wealth transfer will be many times larger than anyone has previously estimated,'' said Paul G. Schervish, director of the Boston College Social Welfare Research Institute, who has spent the last 15 years studying wealth and who created a computer model to study wealth transfers. **********The new figures suggest that charities, in particular, stand to benefit from a platinum era of giving. Mr. Schervish and John J. Havens, his deputy at the institute, estimated that between now and 2055 charities would receive bequests of $16 trillion to $53 trillion, measured in 1998 dollars, assuming that the estate tax remains unchanged. **********The widely cited estimate of $10.4 trillion -- about $13 trillion today adjusted for inflation -- in wealth transfer was made in 1993 by two Cornell University professors, Robert B. Avery and Michael S. Rendall, using data from the Census Bureau and other sources. Their estimate was restricted to households in which the chief wage earner was 50 or older and who had living children; it covered 1990 to 2044. **********The Boston College analysis, using a computer simulation model created to estimate wealth transfers, covers all Americans who were at least age 18 in 1998. It estimates wealth transfers from 1998 to 2052, when the youngest of those in the study will turn 73. **********The Boston College study is based on modest assumptions about growth in wealth compared with historical experience. The study's low estimate that $41 billion will be transferred between generations by 2055 assumes that the value of all assets, adjusted for inflation, increases at 2 percent annually, while the high estimate assumes 4 percent annual real growth. Another profile assumes 3 percent annual real growth in the value of assets and projects $73 trillion in wealth transfers. **********Actual growth in wealth, adjusted for inflation, averaged 5.3 percent  annually from 1950 to this year, according to Prof. Edward N. Wolff, a New York University wealth expert. **********Total wealth in 1998 was $32 trillion, the Boston College researchers estimated. Professor Wolff, who had not seen the new study, said, ''That figure is in the right neighborhood,'' noting that his own research indicated total wealth of $29.1 trillion today. **********The amount of wealth transferred can be greater than current wealth for two reasons. One is economic growth. The other is that over 55 years some fortunes will pass through two -- even three -- generations. Mr. Avery, now an economist with the Federal Reserve, said that while he had some qualms about the techniques used by the Boston College researchers, as described to him in a telephone interview, their estimates sounded reasonable over all. **********Mr. Avery warned, however, that while economists could make fairly accurate predictions about death rates far into the future, assumptions about how much wealth people would accumulate were risky, especially looking out a half-century. **********''The important message is that there is a lot of wealth in this country,'' Mr. Avery said. **********John J. Havens, a co-author of the Boston College study, said that while he was confident of the economic model he wanted to focus on the low end of the estimate, $41 trillion, because ''it helps protect against potential charges of irrational exuberance arising from'' the computer model's assuming steady economic growth without a depression or a sustained recession in the first half of the 21st century. **********A quarter-century ago Professor Havens developed one of the first computer programs to model economic behavior. The model estimates that for estates of $20 million or more, 39 percent of the money will go to charity, 23 percent to heirs, 34 percent to taxes and 3 percent for fees and burial expenses. Data from the Internal Revenue Service show the same ratios in 1995 for large estates. **********For estates of $1 million to just under $5 million, the study assumes that charity will get 8 percent; heirs, 66 percent; taxes, 22 percent, and fees and burial expenses, 4 percent. **********For estates of less than $1 million, Professors Schervish and Havens estimated, nearly 90 cents of each dollar would be passed to heirs and little would go to charity or taxes. **********One recent analysis found that among estates valued at $600,000 to $1 million in 1997, estate taxes averaged 6 percent, even though the estate tax rate began at 37 percent on amounts above the $600,000 exemption then in effect. **********The Boston College study covers what are known as final estates, meaning the death of a single person or the second spouse in a married couple, since bequests to a spouse are tax free. The estimates of how much will be bequeathed to charity may be low, based on I.R.S. data in recent years, which show that growing numbers of people are engaging in estate planning so that more of their money will go to charity after their deaths and less to the Government. The I.R.S. data show that the share of money in estates going to charity is slowly rising, a trend that if continued through 2055 would mean far more for charities than the $16 trillion to $53 trillion cited in the study. **********If the estate tax is repealed or significantly reduced, however, as Congress voted to do earlier this year in a bill that President Clinton vetoed, bequests to charities might be smaller than the Boston College model predicted."

Halts Trading in the Shares of 6 Internet-Related Companies,S.E.C. Halts Trading in the Shares of 6 Internet-Related Companies," **********The Securities and Exchange Commission halted trading on Friday in six companies whose shares have soared recently as they have been swept up in the investment frenzy over anything related to the Internet. Five of the companies have ties to a stock promoter who was banned from the brokerage industry last year because of violations of securities laws. **********The shares of each of the six companies, whose trading was halted for two weeks, are listed on the relatively obscure OTC Bulletin Board, a small-capitalization market whose listing requirements are far less stringent than those of the Nasdaq national and small-capitalization markets. But the stocks' skyrocketing prices have attracted the attention of some supposedly sophisticated investors. **********One of the companies, USA Talks.com, whose shares have climbed nearly 300 percent so far this year, is among the largest holdings of the WWW Internet Fund, a $16 million mutual fund that invests in Internet-related stocks. The fund has gained more than 38 percent this year, in large part because of USA Talks. **********The S.E.C. said it had halted trading in USA Talks.com ''because of questions that have been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated information concerning, among other things, the status and extent of USA Talks' business operations.'' **********The commission cited similar reasons in an unrelated action in which it halted trading in five companies with ties to Peter Tosto, a stock promoter who also goes by the name of Peter Lybrand; he was barred from the brokerage industry last year. Shares of those companies -- Citron Inc., Electronic Transfer Associates Inc., Invest Holdings Group Inc., Polus Inc. and Smartek Inc. -- have climbed at least 57 percent and as much as 382 percent this year. **********An S.E.C. official said the halt in trading of USA Talks was not related to that of the other companies. Allen Portnoy, the chief executive of USA Talks, said in an interview the company ''absolutely is for real'' and it had no relationship with Mr. Tosto. **********Beginning today, USA Talks plans to sell long-distance telephone service using Internet technologies. The service, which is available only to residents of California, has been offered for several months at no charge in a special promotion. **********''The S.E.C. is questioning the existence of our long-distance network, so we'll let them try it as proof our network exists,'' Mr. Portnoy said. Despite having no revenue, the stock of USA Talks has climbed from less than $4 last fall to more than $63 last month. The stock last traded for $52.25, which gave the company's 19.2 million shares a total value of more than $1 billion. **********Most of the five other companies whose trading was halted on Friday also have been promoted as having some connection to the Internet, and each of them has a connection to Mr. Tosto, a former stockbroker. **********Steven Kaplan, a Manhattan lawyer who said he represents Mr. Tosto, declined to comment on Friday on his client's connections to those companies. **********In 1997, Mr. Tosto and his public relations company, Investor Relations Inc., were ordered by the S.E.C. to pay $1.1 million in restitution for securities law violations related to their promotion of the stock of San Diego Bancorp. Mr. Tosto, in a settlement with the S.E.C., neither admitted to nor denied the allegations."

Ratko Mladic are the most prominent among the suspects wanted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. **********President Clinton said today at a news conference that the reward was not meant to encourage the assassination of Mr. Milosevic, nor to encourage bounty hunters, but was intended as an incentive because Serbia does not comply with extradition treaties. In the case of Mr. Milosevic, whose whereabouts are well known, officials said they assumed that at some point he might travel outside Serbia and that the reward would still apply. **********General Mladic has lived in Belgrade for the last three years, and the Clinton Administration chose not to put pressure on Mr. Milosevic to hand him over when the Yugoslav leader was still the  Administration's partner in the search for peace in the Balkans. **********Dr. Karadzic lives in the Serbian-controlled area of Bosnia, and the Pentagon long opposed any operation to seize him, fearing that some American soldiers might die in the operation or be attacked afterward. Others argued that NATO should be forced to arrest him, but he has remained at large. **********At a briefing this week, the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, noted that Mr. Clinton had recently encouraged other countries overseeing military sectors in Bosnia to arrest indicted war criminals in their jurisdictions. **********The reward is being offered under a special State Department program begun a decade ago and originally intended to encourage the arrest of terrorists responsible for the killings of Americans. **********Under the program, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has discretion to determine the size of a reward if a suspect is captured. State Department officials said that the amount would be linked to the type of information provided and other factors, and that American and other NATO soldiers in the Balkans are not entitled to the money."

The company introduced a new server and a new notebook computer with an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. processor for the Prosignia line. **********Compaq is wrestling with sluggish sales to small businesses, the main buyers of Prosignia products. Having the distributors Tech Data Corporation and Ingram Micro Inc. build the machines to customers' orders, much as the Dell Computer Corporation does for its PC's, will help Compaq move more quickly and cut manufacturing costs. Compaq will also avoid alienating its distributors. **********''It's hard to go direct without alienating all your channel partners,'' said Dan Niles, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ''They have to take baby steps to do this.'' **********Compaq shares rose 31.25 cents to close at $31.50. Ingram Micro gained $1.1875, to $19.50. Tech Data rose $2.625, to $19.125. **********Compaq, which started selling some machines directly to users in November, said direct sales were now about $15 million a day worldwide. The move has been difficult, though, because most Compaq sales are through resellers and dealers, who do not welcome competition. **********Compaq has had to raise the incentives offered to distributors to sell the Prosignia PC's, which it also sells directly to buyers through its own Internet and telephone sales. It is now offering 2 percent to 4 percent in additional fees to distributors who sell the products. **********Retailers that will sell Prosignia include Officemax, CompUSA, Staples and Office Depot. Retailers will be able to order build-to-order systems from Ingram Micro and Tech Data and have them delivered to either the customers or the stores, cutting down on inventory and delivery time. Tech Data and Ingram Micro will build the machines in Houston, near Compaq's headquarters. The distributors will also staff the centers that take orders from  and deliver the PC's to dealers. **********Some analysts said the variety of outlets through which Compaq was now selling could make it more confusing for customers. ''There may be such a thing as too much customer choice,'' said Lou Mazzucchelli of Gerard Klauer Mattison."

North Korea will mark the 50th anniversary of Communist rule next month and some analysts have suggested that the test of the missile, which theoretically has the capacity to reach Alaska or Hawaii, would be staged as part of the celebrations. **********As the possible test loomed, the United States, South Korea and Japan have shown an unusually high degree of diplomatic coordination in condemning North Korea and pledging to slow down food and oil assistance if the test is carried out. This month, Japan and the United States also agreed to conduct joint research on a missile-defense system that in theory could destroy incoming ballistic missiles from North Korea. **********Administration officials were cautious today in forecasting what, if anything, might come out of the talks in Berlin. But they noted recent, relatively conciliatory statements from Pyongyang. **********''There are signs that North Korea wants to improve relations,'' a senior official involved in the policy said. **********The Administration was also encouraged that North Korea had invited a correspondent from Cable News Network to report from the country this month, the first such opening to Western television. **********There was also some suggestion today that the North Koreans were showing interest in proposals laid out in June by a United States envoy, former Defense Secretary William J. Perry. **********Mr. Perry essentially offered the lifting of some trade sanctions and the beginning of a formal recognition of North Korea in return for a halt to its testing of missiles and an end to its export of missile technology to the Middle East and Pakistan. **********Some members of Congress have been briefed on Mr. Perry's proposals, but they have not been made public.

United (www.ual.com) said its Web site's share of its bookings was 1.5 percent, while American Airlines (www.aa.com), a unit of the AMR Corporation, said its Internet bookings were just under 2 percent and growing by 25 percent a year. **********Over all, Jupiter Communications, a market research firm in New York, has forecast that air travel bookings through the Internet will grow to 8 percent ($7 billion) in 2002, from 2 percent in 1998. And as the electronic share of bookings grows, many agents and travel industry officials say the major airlines are determined not to yield that business to such Internet travel agencies as Expedia, Preview Travel, Travelocity and Internet Travel Network, whose sale of airline tickets is increasing steadily. **********The Microsoft Corporation, for example, said last week that its MSN Expedia service (on MSN.com) posted sales of $250 million last year -- mostly airline tickets -- a 150 percent increase over 1997. **********While that is minuscule compared with the airline industry's $79.45 billion in revenues in 1997, the last year for which figures are available, the Internet agencies' sales are expected to continue growing. **********''Airlines have been cutting commissions to travel agents for years, long before on-line travel came on the scene,'' Suzi LeVine, a product manager at MSN Expedia, said. ''This is another step in that direction and ultimately against customers' ability to gain access to a broad set of choices.'' **********The airline industry has consistently denied any such intent. **********The two-tier Delta policy is reminiscent of Citibank's policy in the early 1980's, in the early days of the automated teller machine, of requiring a $5,000 minimum balance for customers at some branches to be served by human tellers. At the same time, it follows a trend in other services -- notably stock trading -- in which on-line customers are offered lower rates. **********At the Satellite Airlines Center on East 59th Street in Manhattan yesterday, Dr. Wilbur Bowne, who was booking a Delta flight to a meeting in New Orleans, called the surcharge ''unfair to the customer.'' But he also said that in the future he would use the Internet. **********Ken Ward, a travel agent in Atlanta, Delta's corporate backyard, said:  ''I've been surprised by the groundswell of resentment toward Delta. Two dollars for a round trip isn't much, but to a lot of customers it's a lot like creeping taxes.'' **********In Delta's message to travel agents on Monday, advising them of its new policy, effective immediately, the company said its cost of distributing tickets had increased more than 280 percent since 1990, to more than $1 billion in the fiscal year 1998, while revenue had grown just 50 percent over that same period. **********Moreover, it added, three of the four computer reservation systems used by most airlines and travel agents had already announced fare increases effective early this year. It said it would not apply the surcharge to tickets from its Web site because it was the least expensive way of issuing tickets. **********The expense of traditional ticketing has led the airlines in recent years to encourage another electronic innovation, the paperless ticket. But all tickets purchased through Delta's Web site, whether traditional or paperless, will be exempt from its new surcharge. **********The Travel Industry Association of America said that the number of people who booked airline, hotel and rental car reservations on the Internet increased 24 percent last year to 6.7 million, from 5.4 million in 1997.  With sales of $816 million, according to Jupiter, travel is the second-largest on-line industry, trailing only PC hardware and software sales ($836 million). **********While slow to merchandise their own Web sites, airlines are going all-out now to reap its presumptive riches. **********In the last two years they have been adding not just bargain fares available only on their Web sites, but discounts for hotels and rental cars. **********They often give bonus frequent-flier miles to customers who book on their Web site and frequent fliers can pay for certain bargain flights for a nominal fee plus frequent-flier miles. Thus Continental Airlines recently posted round-trip flights between Houston and Newark and between Seattle and New York for $29 plus 17,500 miles. **********Many who book on airline Internet sites appear to be younger passengers who have flown only infrequently in the past, the airlines say, and have rarely if ever dealt with a travel agent. **********United said that 81 percent of its sales last year came through travel agents. **********Nevertheless, travel agents contend that booking directly with airline Web sites will ultimately hurt consumers. **********''They will inevitably pay more,'' said Joe Galloway, the president of the American Society of Travel Agents, ''since they won't have the comparative fare and schedule options -- provided by travel agents -- that can help them save hundreds of dollars, as shown by every independent study.''"

The company used its monopoly in operating systems to force customers to take its Internet browser. It cut prices on its monopoly product for computer makers that agreed to buy its other products. **********The other side warns that any remedy chosen by the government will be either meaningless or so cumbersome that it will deter innovation and retard progress. **********Both sides are right, and therein lies the dilemma. It will be bad if Microsoft is allowed to continue acting as it has, using its clout to buy off or scare away would-be competitors. Doing anything about it might be worse. **********The dilemma can be solved only if Microsoft decides to change its ways voluntarily. The company must recognize that it cannot compete in the same way that it once did -- and in the same way that most of its competitors do -- by using every advantage. It must accept that there are limits that apply to a dominant company that do not bind lesser rivals. Innovation is fine. Threats and intimidation are not. **********That is difficult because Microsoft is, after all, only 24 years old. Companies that have previously found themselves in positions of such dominance -- I.B.M. in 1960's computers or General Motors in 1950's cars, for example -- were run by executives who had joined the companies when they were successful and powerful.  Microsoft is still run by the first generation of executives, who vividly remember what it was like to be a scrappy underdog. They know no other way of doing business. **********If Microsoft did agree to such a change, it would then have the difficult task of convincing the Justice Department that the change was real. Only then could a settlement be negotiated that allowed for minimal government intrusion on Microsoft's ability to innovate. The company could give computer makers like Dell and Compaq a role in picking the options they want in the Windows operating system. Microsoft might end up selling systems with varying features and prices, as Intel does with chips. **********William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, says he wants a settlement, but his comments at the company's annual meeting showed little inclination to compromise. **********Microsoft, a company that once disdained Washington lobbying, now embraces it with the fervor of a convert. It seems to hope that even if it does lose in court, it can get a better deal from a Republican administration in 2001. Since both Microsoft and its high-technology foes have plenty of money, this could descend into a replay of Glass-Steagall. In that fight, the various financial services interests threw money at politicians for years, producing legislative stalemate and fat campaign treasuries. Finally, the various companies cut a deal, and Congress passed a bill. **********If Microsoft goes that route, it will spend its money on campaign contributions and its management time parrying legal thrusts. Even if the strategy works, Microsoft could end up in worse shape than if its executives were able to concentrate on improving its products and satisfying customers.

The idea was that if someone came in and stole the love of your erstwhile sweetheart, he should be forced to pay for the pain he inflicted on you. **********You don't hear much about such suits in matters of the heart these days. The prevailing idea is that people have the right to choose their own partners, including the right to change their minds. **********But the concept lives on for really important things -- like mega-mergers. With the blessing of the Delaware courts, which are the arbiters of such things because most major companies are incorporated there, the payments have become standard in corporate marriage contracts. **********The idea is that a jilted suitor should be compensated for the trouble and expense required to put together the marriage plan. That sounds quite reasonable -- lawyers and investment bankers don't come cheap these days -- but there should be limits. Perhaps $2 billion is a bit high. **********That is the price that American Home Products has negotiated to get if its planned marriage to Warner-Lambert does not make it to the altar. To be sure, it's not hard to understand why American Home Products felt a need to negotiate such a fee, given that it loses fiances faster than Elizabeth Taylor used to shed husbands. Deals with SmithKline Beecham and Monsanto collapsed last year. **********The threat to this union comes from Pfizer, which wants to buy Warner-Lambert and is willing to pay more than American Home is offering. But the offer Pfizer unveiled yesterday is contingent on the termination fee going away. Pfizer is suing in Delaware to have the fee ruled illegal, and it could be an interesting fight. **********The controlling case in Delaware stems from a shareholder challenge to the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger in 1997, which featured an until-then unheard of termination fee of $550 million. The Delaware Supreme Court said the fee, which equaled 2 percent of the market value of Bell Atlantic, ''was a reasonable forecast of damages'' if the deal collapsed and was ''neither coercive nor unconscionable.'' **********That ruling opened the floodgates. Thomson Financial Securities Data, which tracks such things, reports that the record fee leaped to $1.8 billion last year in the GTE-Bell Atlantic agreement. This fee -- about 2.7 percent of the market value of American Home -- breaks the record. **********The purpose of such agreements, of course, is to head off competing bids. If this provision stands, Pfizer would have to pay about $2.50 a share more than American Home would have to pay to have a comparable bid. The breakup fee also has the interesting twist that it appears to be designed to assure that Pfizer could not use favorable pooling accounting -- as American Home plans to do -- if the merger is completed. **********This deal is tangled because Pfizer contends that Warner-Lambert knew Pfizer was willing to pay more than American Home was offering even before the deal was signed. Under those circumstances, agreeing to a huge termination fee smacks of an effort to ward off an unwelcome suitor, rather than a necessary part of a deal that is designed to benefit shareholders. **********American Home and Warner-Lambert will no doubt point to expectations of great long-range benefits for shareholders if their merger is completed. Maybe they will be persuasive. But the courts should make sure that the final arbiters of which deal is better are the shareholders of Warner-Lambert. After all, they do own the company."

''If America is to live up to its role as leading nation of the world, it must uphold the human rights of the survivors of the massacre as well as the deceased.'' **********Though small in number, the protesters expressed the sentiments of many South Koreans, who sharply criticized the United States for long ignoring the claims of massacre survivors and called on their own Government to conduct an independent investigation. **********On Thursday, the Pentagon announced it would undertake a new and thorough inquiry into reports that American soldiers killed hundreds of refugees under a bridge near No Gun Ri in South Korea at the start of the war. **********That new investigation was prompted by the Associated Press article, in which some of the American soldiers at No Gun Ri said they had been ordered to fire on the refugees because their commanders believed that North Korean troops, disguised as peasants, had infiltrated a refugee column and were shooting at the Americans. **********Mr. Jeon, who became separated from his family as they fled the war's early fighting, said his son and daughter, ages 5 and 2, were killed by American gunfire as they took cover with his wife under the bridge at No Gun Ri. Although his wife, Park Sun-yong, survived the attack, she was critically wounded. **********She was not at the protest today but said in a telephone interview from her home: ''Now, some of the burden from 50 years of rage and sadness seems to be easing. Now I can die in peace. **********''You see, my children's lives were taken away so unjustly. They died such vicious deaths -- their bodies were ripped apart right in front of my eyes. The U.S. Secretary of Defense can conduct all the investigations he wants to, but he'll find that our memories of the event are still the same.'' **********Ms. Park, now 73, said she harbors no bitterness toward the United States, noting that after the attack an American medic discovered her bleeding and unconscious and saved her life. **********The Rev. Moon Bae Gol, director of a group called the Committee to Stop Crime by the United States Military, today called on the United States to prosecute the soldiers who took part in the massacre and to compensate relatives of those who perished. **********He demanded that the South Korean Government and the Parliament form a special commission to investigate the incident. Sohn Woo-Hyun, a Korean Government spokesman, said the Government is gathering evidence into the attack. **********The protesters at the military base said violence by United States soldiers in South Korea is not just a thing of the past, but continues today. **********They said dozens of crimes, including murder, theft and assaults by American soldiers, had gone unpunished in recent years. More than 37,000 United States troops are based in South Korea. **********On a wall just outside the gate of the Yongsan Army Base, the protesters hung graphic posters of battered South Koreans that they said were victims of violent crimes by United States military personnel."

But those that do had already changed their flight plans in order to keep out of harm's way. **********''Our daily nonstop from London to Delhi usually flies over a small part of Yugoslavia,'' Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines, said yesterday. ''But before hostilities broke out we changed our routing to about 200 miles north of the bombing.'' **********Delta Air Lines does not fly anywhere close to the combat zone, but Austrian Airlines, which schedules flights in cooperation with Delta, has extensive routes to Eastern Europe from its Vienna headquarters, including routes to cities in Bosnia, Croatia and Yugoslavia. **********Under that partnership, Delta passengers bound for any of those destinations would ordinarily fly to Vienna, then connect with Austrian Airlines for the remainder of the journey. **********But when Delta decided on Wednesday that the bombing threats were not bluffs, it stopped taking reservations or issuing tickets for European destinations beyond Vienna. And Austrian Airlines itself canceled its flights into or near the fighting zone. **********Similarly, British Airways and Lufthansa, which have extensive operations from the United States to Western Europe, and lesser operations to Eastern Europe, also canceled flights they considered risky. **********Last Sunday, for example, British Airways suspended service between Gatwick Airport in London and Belgrade, Serbia; then it canceled that service altogether until at least April 8. Yesterday the airline resumed service to Zagreb, Croatia, and, for now, it plans to continue its normal three-times-a-week service between London and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Lufthansa also has suspended its Belgrade service. **********Austrian Airlines canceled service not only to Belgrade but as of yesterday also to Timisoara, Romania; Tirana, Albania; and Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka in Bosnia. But the airline restored service to Skopje, Macedonia, yesterday, and continued its scheduled service to Sofia, Bulgaria, as well as Zagreb and Ljubljana. **********Unlike the Government decree ordering United States planes to keep out of the fighting zone, British Airways and Austrian Airlines said they acted on their own -- but after extensive consultation. ''Those decisions are made by our Operations Control in London, who obviously are in close touch with the Foreign Office and others,'' said John W. Lampl, a British Airways spokesman. **********Daniel Kennedy, the spokesman for Austrian Airways, said its decisions on whether to cancel or suspend flights would be ''made by our crisis management team in Vienna.'' **********In an oddly prophetic statement in the current Sky Lines, the Austrian Airlines in-flight magazine, Mario Rehulka and Dr. Herbert Bammer, the airline's co-presidents, wrote, ''There have always been regional trends that have dampened demand in trade and travel, and these will persist.''"

But the rise of the Internet now offers issuers and buyers at least the potential to streamline the underwriting process. **********William R. Hambrecht, the longtime Silicon Valley investment banker, has made a handsome living bankrolling the future. That said, his decision to introduce an on-line auction system for underwriting initial public stock offerings probably did not make him many friends on Wall Street. **********Mr. Hambrecht, who now runs W. R. Hambrecht & Company, an investment banking boutique in San Francisco, took some time out from skiing in Sun Valley, Idaho, last week to talk about E-underwriting. He also offered some thoughts on the recent plunge in Internet stocks. **********Q. What made you think this sort of system is necessary? **********A. Over the last few years, we did a few offerings that really made me rethink the process and wonder if we were doing it right. **********The first one was for Boston Beer, the company that makes Samuel Adams. Jim Koch, the head of Boston Beer, insisted that one-third of the offering be sold to his customers. So he put a label announcing the sale on his beer bottles. Within three weeks we had orders from 120,000 people. **********After the offering was over, the company's chief financial officer agreed to track what happened to those people. Two and a half years later, half of those folks still owned the stock. I came away from that experience thinking that people who had a real natural affinity for the company were there. **********The other lesson I learned was that conventional investment firms were not set up to handle that sort of volume. The more I worked with the Net, it convinced me it was a great tool to communicate. So I wanted to try to set up a system whereby the Internet could communicate with affinity groups for companies and do it in an efficient way. **********Q. You seem to believe that a Dutch auction system, where the offering price is set by the underwriter at the highest price at which it can sell all the shares, will help prevent volatility. How will it do that? **********A. The reason the Dutch auction will work is that it clears the inventory all at once and doesn't make any buyer who bids aggressively look dumb. The system will try to move the offering price closer to the market level, and in so doing discourage day traders. **********Q. If this auction system caught on, wouldn't it change the economics of underwriting? **********A. It will pare underwriting margins. But this is happening to every distribution channel via the Internet. To be honest, the real economics to the underwriter that will change are the trading commissions that come back from preferential accounts. If you give 10 percent of an offering to a good client, he is generally a pretty happy client. **********Q. What has been the reaction on Wall Street to this idea? **********A. Initially, most of the people I respect on Wall Street have reacted by asking, ''Why are you doing this to us?'' But most understand something like this is going to happen, and they are asking how they can work with us on this, because it is a more efficient way to do it. **********Q. Speaking of efficiency, is that the way you would characterize the manner in which investors have repriced a lot of Internet stocks over the past month? **********A. Internet stocks got way ahead of themselves. The Lycos-USA Networks deal reminded people that in the real world, market caps have to have some relationship to future value. To me, what has been going on is a very good thing, because a real price collapse could be very destructive, particularly in the initial public offering market. **********Q. Most of these companies are still not making any money. Is it getting any easier to identify who the survivors will be? **********A. Each month gives you more data as to who is getting there. You can see the numbers of people using the system, the quality of advertisers. And the E-commerce numbers are starting to show some things. Over the next year we should get a better idea. **********Q. All of this interest in the Internet is coming at a time when the economy is still growing at a vigorous rate. What happens to these companies when it weakens? **********A. My theory about software companies, and I think it will hold for Internet companies, is that there is not a lot of risk to them in cyclical turns in the economy. These companies don't have their capital tied up in fixed inventories; they have it tied up in cash. Yahoo, for example, has something like 700 employees and no fixed assets. They should be able to adjust to almost anything."

''It has held in favor of democracy and of the people of South Africa,'' he said. **********African National Congress officials started off the campaign season saying they wanted a two-thirds majority so they could consider changing some aspects of the Constitution.

It failed to win a clear majority in only two provinces, the Western Cape, which includes Cape Town, and KwaZulu/Natal, which includes Durban and is the heartland of the Inkatha Freedom Party. **********Negotiations over coalitions between various parties have already begun. **********Several newspapers have reported that the A.N.C. is offering Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi,  the job of Deputy President in exchange for control over who will be the premier of the KwaZulu/Natal province. **********Mr. Mbeki seemed to give his strongest public signal yet that he would appoint Mr. Buthelezi in his Cabinet to be announced next week. **********He called Mr. Buthelezi up to the stage from where he was sitting with his Inkatha colleagues, saying jokingly, ''I want to take him out of the I.F.P. and put him in government.'' **********According to the South African Press Association, Mr. Buthelezi tonight denied that he had been offered the deputy position. On whether he would accept the post if it was offered, he replied: ''That is like saying if you were offered a box of chocolates, would you eat them?'' **********The African National Congress  and Inkatha have been rivals for more than a decade. Before the 1994 elections more than 10,000 people died in fighting between the two sides. But in recent years, the two parties have been trying to work together and Mr. Buthelezi has filled in as President whenever President Nelson Mandela and Mr. Mbeki were out of the country at the same time. **********Although some areas of Kwazulu/ Natal were tense during the election campaign, violence was minimal."

He was 98 and lived in Belfast. **********Dr. Fraser was a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps in West Africa in 1941 when it sent him to Algiers to direct tests of what was then a new and largely untested drug, penicillin. Early results were disappointing. But working in a large hospital with patients suffering from septicemia, he became convinced that it could be effective if administered early -- before the disorder advanced and became a killer. **********He insisted on a chance to test the new drug on the front lines, to be applied directly as casualties came in.

Operating surrounded by bombardments and heavy shelling, he earned a Distinguished Service Order and went on with the troops to the beachhead at Salerno, the invasion of France and the Indian campaign. **********The son of a general practitioner, he was born in Belfast and was educated there at the Royal Academical Institution and Queen's University, graduating in medicine and surgery. He trained under doctors who knew the horrors of the trenches and battlefields of France, and much later he described their make-do techniques in his autobiography, ''Blood, Sweat and Cheers'' (1989). **********He received a surgical appointment at Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, but he volunteered for service as soon as war broke out in Europe once again in 1939. In 1946 he resumed his career as a surgeon and teacher in Belfast. **********He retired in 1966 as the senior surgeon at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. In the 1970's he served as founding chairman of the Police Authority in Northern Ireland and, from then until 1992, he remained a founding member of the Ulster Defense Regiment Advisory Council -- positions that made him a potential target of terrorism in the province. **********The Irish Republican Army bombed a house close to his in March 1976, and the assumption was at the time that he was the real target because of his association with the Ulster forces. Army demolition experts defused another large bomb near his home toward the end of that year. **********He lectured throughout Britain and in the United States. Among his many awards were the French Legion of Honor and decorations from Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands. **********Dr. Fraser's wife, Eleanor Mitchell Fraser, died in 1992. His survivors include a son and a daughter."

The board of Zip2 unanimously approved the deal. **********Zip2, based in Mountain View, Calif., will become an operating unit of the Altavista Company, a search engine based in Palo Alto, Calif., that Compaq acquired last year in its takeover of the Digital Equipment Corporation. Compaq, which is based in Houston, has said it hopes to spin off Altavista as a separately traded company later this year. **********Compaq also announced yesterday that its $220 million offer for the Internet commerce site Shopping.com had been accepted at $18.25 a share. Compaq stock closed at $42.8125, down 18.75 cents, yesterday. Shopping.com closed at 18.3125, up 31.25 cents. **********Bringing both Zip2 and Shopping.com into the Altavista fold, Mr. Schrock said, will help Altavista achieve its goal of becoming a one-stop on-line shopping and information destination. **********''We want to be one of the top three revenue sites on the Net by year-end 2002, and to do that, you have to bring the Internet to a relevant local perspective that's in touch with your everyday life,'' Mr. Schrock said. ''The trick in the on-line world is to achieve scale where you get enough audience to view those classifieds and buy products once users find them.'' **********The on-line ratings firm Relevant Knowledge lists Altavista as ninth of all sites on the World Wide Web in terms of traffic. **********While Altavista can attract international traffic from its parent company, Compaq, the world's largest maker of personal computers, the deals with Shopping.com and Zip2 let Altavista enter the commerce and local information arenas. **********Zip2 already has partnerships with media companies in 60 of the 100 top metropolitan areas, including The New York Times Company, for which it helped create the on-line city guide, New York Today. **********Mr. Schrock cited figures from Jupiter Communications, a New York-based research firm, that 54 percent of all advertising on the Internet will be done on a local level, and that more than 90 percent of purchases made on line will occur with merchants within 10 miles of the user. **********While considered among the fastest and most powerful of the Internet search engines, Altavista has been perceived by analysts to have lagged behind its competitors in the race to aggregate content and visitors to one site on line. Inroads to local markets are critically important for search engines, which are typically broad in scope, analysts say. **********''Altavista has had a great presence, and it doesn't want to squander that,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen Communications, a research firm based in Bethesda, Md. ''It's a reminder on the heels of whatever becomes of the Lycos-USA Networks deal that consolidation is the name of the game here. The idea of merging skills from slightly different sectors is important.'' **********So, too, is the idea of merging the revenue from classified advertisements, a crucial revenue source for newspapers, with the growing on-line medium. The marriage between Zip2 and Altavista may give Zip2's media partners a wider Internet presence. **********Still, Lisa Allen, an analyst for Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass., was not optimistic about the deal. **********''They're late, they're late, they're really late -- no matter how good they may be,'' Ms. Allen said. ''We've seen or heard nothing about how these assets will be integrated. It all feels really squishy. It's like, 'We've been a stand-alone company for three weeks; we have to make a deal.' '' **********Zip2's interim chief executive, Derek Proudian, said the deal with Altavista would enable the company to ''put the pedal to the metal'' on other products Zip2 had not had the capital to pursue. **********''We, in conjunction with our local media partners, have the platform and content, the raw DNA to become the major traffic site on the Internet,'' Mr. Proudian said. **********Last May, Zip2 canceled plans to merge with CitySearch, a competing creator of city guides, a month after an alliance was announced. **********In a separate move, Zip2 plans to announce a new software product on Wednesday at the Editor & Publisher's Interactive Newspaper Conference in Atlanta. Mr. Proudian said the product, called Home Base, would be licensed to its media partners and would add wider personalization tools to its existing on-line guides."

Get Me The Internet","THE MARKETS: Market Place; Hello, Operator? Get Me The Internet"," **********When John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems Inc., walks into his windowless, cubicle-like office here each morning, he sees a dinosaur on his desk that he is intent on driving to extinction. **********It sits to the left of his laptop computer's docking station: a standard office telephone made by Lucent Technologies Inc., the former equipment arm of the AT&T Corporation and North America's largest maker of traditional telephone gear. **********Mr. Chambers likes to think of Cisco, the No. 1 maker of equipment for data networks, as the Anti-Lucent; his favorite two expressions are ''new world'' (read Cisco and the Internet) and ''old world'' (read Lucent and traditional communications). So just about every time he uses that phone he bristles. **********''The dinosaur on my desk, or at home, I want gone in the next 12 months,'' he says. **********What he means is that by this time next year he wants Cisco to be deploying phone systems based on Internet technology rather than on traditional communications systems. If nothing else, he wants almost all of Cisco's 17,000 employees using them. **********While Mr. Chambers may exaggerate the gap for effect, there certainly are new and old worlds in the communications equipment business, and they are locked in a struggle to control the networks of the future and the tens, perhaps hundreds, of billions of dollars that will be spent to build them. **********No part of that battle is more intense than the fight to control how standard voice telephone calls will be transmitted using the technology known variously as Internet telephony or voice-over-I.P. The I.P. stands for Internet protocol, the language of cyberspace. **********The challenges of that battle are clearly evident right there on Mr. Chambers' desk. After all, Internet phones do exist today -- Cisco makes them -- but for now, Mr. Chambers uses the dinosaur. It is a battle between the reliable, pin-drop quality of today's telecommunications technology and the largely experimental, often garbled but fantastically promising Internet-based technology of tomorrow. **********''This is about the hearts and minds of the network,'' said Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a leading high-technology consulting firm based in Boston. ''For consumers, it's probably going to mean cheaper costs. The consumer is going to be using voice-over-I.P. without even knowing it.'' **********Yet, for all of the promise, most of the communications industry agrees that Internet phone calls are not quite ready for prime time. While  I.P. systems are selling well in niche phone markets, they are still too unreliable, often deliver low sound quality and are perhaps even too expensive to become the underlying network language for mainstream phone calls. **********''There's a lot of hype,'' said Howard McNally, president of the AT&T unit that includes the company's small Internet telephony operation. ''It's just not there yet.'' **********The Sprint Corporation and MCI Worldcom Inc. are not offering voice-over-I.P. calls at all. **********That is not to suggest that the long-distance giants are happily stuck in  the old world. Each of the major carriers is getting set to upgrade the core of its network to use a technology called asynchronous transfer mode, which, like Internet protocol increases efficiency by breaking communications down into small pieces. But while it may sometimes not be as efficient as I.P., it has the advantage of being more reliable. **********One strength of I.P., in addition to the allure of being the language of the Internet, is that it is relatively simple to deploy. But what makes it even more appealing is that it can be used on the millions of existing corporate and institutional networks based on Internet protocol and with the tens of millions of personal computers and other consumer devices for which Internet protocol is already a lingua franca. **********For all these reasons, the belief in many parts of the communications industry that Internet phone calls are not ready for the mainstream right now is matched by an equally strong conviction that if Internet phone calls do not move to the mainstream, the mainstream will eventually come to Internet phone calls. **********Today, Internet phone calls often require the use of prepaid calling cards. And generally their primary purpose is to avoid high international charges for conventional phone calls as well as the fees imposed by local phone companies for beginning and ending long-distance calls. But companies are also starting to embrace Internet technology as a way to save money by transmitting calls among branch offices using the computer networks they already have. **********And if Mr. Chambers is ever to feel that his entire office has migrated to the new world, Cisco will have to come up with I.P.-based office phone systems that offer conference calling, call waiting, voice mail, call transferring and other features office workers take for granted. **********But ultimately, Internet-based phone systems could offer services that no one takes for granted today, like easy integration with personal computer applications. Users could easily manage voice and E-mail messages or, where legal, digitally record and transcribe phone conversations. **********''We feel that I.P. telephony services, as they develop multimedia and other capabilities that I.P. enables, are going to be the clear winner in the next two to three years,'' said David Greenblatt, chief operating officer of Net2Phone, the Internet telephone subsidiary of the IDT Corporation, one of the pioneers in Internet phone calls. **********By no means alone in trying to develop Internet phone technology,  Cisco faces competition from three kinds of companies: traditional equipment makers like Lucent, Ericsson A.B., Siemens A.G. and Northern Telecom; data networking companies like the 3Com Corporation and Ascend Communications Inc. (which has agreed to be acquired by Lucent); and upstarts like Vocaltec Communications Ltd. and the Clarent Corporation. **********Lucent, Cisco's biggest and most important competitor, is also hard at work developing Internet telephony products, but its executives naturally have a different view of traditional phone systems. **********''There isn't anything in the industry that provides the reliability, the scalability and the feature functions'' of the traditional office phone system, said William T. O'Shea, who runs Lucent's office systems group. ''There plain isn't another answer today.'' **********But right now the bigger carriers appear to lean toward equipment made by the smaller companies vying for Internet telephony leadership. **********While AT&T is testing Lucent's I.P. enhancement for existing telephone switches, the biggest carrier using Lucent's stand-alone Internet phone system is probably Vocall Communications, a private company based in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Cisco's biggest Internet telephony client is ICG Communications Inc., a medium-sized communications carrier. **********Still, many carriers believe the traditional telephone equipment companies will continue to have an advantage simply because they have more experience designing reliability into their systems. **********Among that group is Noam Bardin, chief technology officer for Delta 3, the Internet telephone unit of RSL Communications, one of the world's biggest Internet telephony carriers. **********Cisco, he said, has ''a huge hurdle to conquer when you think about how people pick up the phone and expect to get a dial tone no matter what. **********''The telecom companies,'' he added, ''already have experience in those challenges.'' **********Delta 3 mostly uses equipment from Ericsson, while IDT, tellingly perhaps, mostly designs its own equipment. IDT has also evaluated equipment from Siemens, which in turn has also worked closely with a small carrier called USA Global Link. **********But the German giant Deutsche Telekom is among the international phone companies that have used equipment from tiny Vocaltec, and when Sprint wanted to evaluate an Internet phone system, it tried products from Clarent, a private company based in Redwood City, Calif. **********Sprint decided against introducing a voice-over-Internet product, but Neil J. Grenfell, an engineering vice president at Sprint, said the decision would not have been different if another company's technology had been used. **********AT&T has been perhaps the most eclectic carrier of all. The company refused to discuss its suppliers, but senior data networking executives and executives close to AT&T said the company initially used modems from U.S. Robotics and other equipment from 3Com, the company that acquired U.S. Robotics. AT&T has also, however, used significant amounts of Internet telephony equipment from Clarent, the executives said, adding that 3Com is trying to negotiate a new Internet telephony deal with AT&T. **********Perhaps the biggest roadblock for Internet telephony is that different companies' systems almost never work with one another. Each wants to dictate the standard and is hoping the others will blink. **********''In ideal conditions it's acceptable,'' Sprint's Mr. Grenfell said of I.P. telephony. ''But I think it's just going to be a novelty for a while. We're really looking for a total integrated solution that is interoperable between vendors and works with what we already have.'' **********Perhaps even with dinosaurs."

It could take just a few days, during the organization's contentious meeting in Seattle, for him to be judged a success or a failure. **********If the violent demonstrations and disruptions of the meeting's opening day today are any guide, Mr. Moore, a seasoned trade negotiator who was briefly prime minister of New Zealand, is now confronting the biggest challenge of his career. **********Mr. Moore, 50, is at the center of the trade meeting that is to bring together President Clinton and top trade officials from the member countries of the Geneva-based organization. The goal of the meeting, now scheduled to run through Friday, is to gain sufficient agreement among the members to support a new round of negotiations aimed at opening global markets further. **********Most chief executives of international organizations are not forced to think about their legacies so early in their terms. But the combination of the divisive 10-month selection fight, which delayed Mr. Moore's installation until September, and the urgent matter of organizing the Seattle conference put great pressure on him. **********That pressure increased even more last week after the W.T.O. failed to come up with an agenda for Seattle. Moreover, much of the attention surrounding that meeting has shifted to the demonstrators who have descended on the city to protest what they see as lack of concern by the trade group on the environmental, safety and labor aspects of trade. **********Mr. Moore wields little decisive power because members can ultimately defy W.T.O. decisions. Yet he is the image maker for the trade group, a particularly sensitive role since it has become the lightning rod for criticism on matters as diverse as genetically modified soybeans, child labor, endangered sea turtles and cheaply sold steel. **********It was Mr. Moore's qualities as a communicator that persuaded important trading nations, including the United States, to support him for director general. ''You can see him going off to Washington, sitting down with Congressmen and convincing them with his folksy way that the W.T.O. isn't something monstrous,'' said a trade diplomat in Geneva. **********Mr. Moore is not afraid of confrontation but prides himself on listening to other viewpoints. He acknowledged on Monday during a meeting with W.T.O. delegates in Seattle that the protesters had some legitimate issues. He also got a dose of what the combative atmosphere might be like in Seattle a few weeks ago in Geneva, when a group of students bolted from a W.T.O. meeting they had been invited to attend, shredded the literature they had been given and chained themselves to the grand staircase at the organization's headquarters. Comrades unfurled banners across the building's stately facade: ''The W.T.O. Kills. Kill the W.T.O.'' **********''It's impolite and bad manners to chain yourself up, then ask for an invitation to see me,'' Mr. Moore responded affably, but firmly. **********The son of New Zealand farmers, Mr. Moore has drawn on his experiences as a construction worker, a meat-industry worker, a printer and later a social worker to bolster his everyman persona. Also a longtime politician and trade negotiator, Mr. Moore has said he is a true believer in trade as a force for prosperity. **********''What's at stake is jobs and an opportunity to raise living standards for everybody,'' he frequently says. **********Despite that, Mr. Moore has run into the reality that profound differences among nations on important trade issues are threatening to derail any new global negotiations -- part of the reason for the W.T.O.'s existence. He has not been able to dislodge trading blocs from entrenched positions. For example, the European Union has not budged from the stance that farm products must be treated specially because their production contributes to maintaining the rapidly vanishing countryside -- a position viewed as pure protectionism by countries like the United States. **********But the director has also received some good marks for his efforts. **********''He was incredibly patient,'' said Brazil's trade negotiator, Celso Amorim. **********''He's honest and he didn't try to play games with us,'' added Nacer Benjelloun-Touimi, who represents Morocco at the W.T.O. **********''He's built bridges, which is good,'' said Munir Akram, Pakistan's representative. ''But he has to deliver in Seattle. I'm convinced a director general can make a difference.'' Both Pakistan and Morocco supported candidates other than Mr. Moore for the W.T.O.'s top job. **********Whatever the outcome in Seattle, Mr. Moore will not lose his job, get a promotion or have his pay cut. In the compromise that ended the prolonged selection fight, he was appointed for a three-year period, to be followed the next three years by his Thai rival for the post, prompting irreverent W.T.O. staffers to nickname him ''Demi Moore.''"

But executives close to the deal said representatives for Airtouch and Vodafone had spent the weekend trying to work out what price Vodafone would be willing to pay for Airtouch shares. **********Vodafone, an on-again, off-again suitor for Airtouch, confirmed its current talks after The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that it had offered to pay more than $45 billion for Airtouch. **********While a combination of Airtouch and Bell Atlantic would create an American wireless giant poised to take on AT&T and the Sprint PCS venture, a combined Vodafone-Airtouch would focus on overseas markets, particularly in Europe. Until now, Vodafone has shunned the United States market. If it acquired Airtouch and retained Airtouch's American operations, the overall impact on domestic consumers could be minimal, analysts said. **********Airtouch representatives received a preliminary proposal on Sunday night from Vodafone to enter into merger negotiations for a deal that would include an exchange of shares and possibly a cash component, the executives said. While no price was disclosed by the companies yesterday, industry professionals suggested that a Vodafone offer could go as high as $90 a share. Whatever the price, it is likely to be a premium to any Bell Atlantic offer. **********Terry Barwick, director of corporate affairs at Vodafone, said executives from his company and Airtouch had talked in recent months. The two companies are stake holders in Europolitan, a leading provider of wireless service in Sweden. **********One executive close to the companies said that while in Europe recently, executives from Airtouch had met with Vodafone's top managers, including Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, who is currently on vacation in Australia. He said there had been no high-level discussions between Mr. Gent and Sam L. Ginn, chairman of Airtouch, in recent days. But if necessary, Mr. Gent could make a stopover in San Francisco when he returns from vacation later this week. **********Mr. Barwick said his company had been surprised by recent reports in the news media of talks between Bell Atlantic and Airtouch and, as a result, decided to make a preliminary offer quickly. Both Bell Atlantic and Vodafone have long flirted with Airtouch. Earlier this year, analysts said, Vodafone made an offer to buy Airtouch's international operations but was rebuffed. It was then that Airtouch turned its attention to Bell Atlantic, though those discussions did not heat up until recently. **********''They are very serious about this offer,'' said Robert Gensler, a telecommunications analyst at T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company. **********Since splitting from Racal Electronics, a communications and electronics company, in 1988, Vodafone has grown into Britain's largest wireless carrier, with almost five million customers, largely through attractive price plans. In the last quarter of 1998, for instance, the company added more than 930,000 customers, mostly on a plan that allows users to pay as they call, rather than sign up for a long-term contract. **********Bell Atlantic and Airtouch still have several issues to work out, including what tax treatment the two companies would receive in a merger. Any deal between the two would dilute Bell Atlantic's earnings. Also, Bell Atlantic agreed to buy the GTE Corporation this summer. That deal has yet to be approved by regulators, and some analysts expressed concern that it could be jeopardized by the past week's talks. **********''I think the GTE and Bell Atlantic deal could be broken up over this,'' said Tim O'Neil, a wireless telecommunications analyst at the Soundview Technology Group. ''I would assume that excluding Vodafone Bell Atlantic would be more prepared to go forward with Airtouch than GTE.'' **********Executives close to Bell Atlantic said the company was not surprised by Vodafone's entry into the bidding for Airtouch. While those executives have said since the weekend that Bell Atlantic could offer as much as $50 billion for Airtouch, or about $83 a  share, it was not clear yesterday whether Bell Atlantic had committed itself to raising its offer. **********Vodafone has been thought to be interested at least in Airtouch's overseas operations. But until now, it was not thought to be keen on entering the United States market, partly because competition is more intense in the United States than in many other markets. Another complicating factor has been that while wireless networks in much of Europe and the Middle East are technologically homogenous, United States carriers use a variety of technical standards, potentially raising operating costs. **********In Europe, Airtouch's properties would complement Vodafone's existing operations. Vodafone's customers outside Britain are largely in Northern and Western Europe; Airtouch's European operations are mainly in Spain, Italy and Portugal. **********Some analysts and investors suggest that Airtouch would be better off cutting a three-way deal, with European properties going to Vodafone and domestic operations sold to Bell Atlantic. **********''I think the way you maximize your benefit to the Airtouch shareholder is to split it up,'' said Michael J. Mahoney, manager of the AIM Global Telecommunications Fund, which owns 439,000 shares of Airtouch. ''If the offers were even-steven, I might have a preference for Bell Atlantic because it's more liquid, but what I really care about is just getting more money for my shareholders.'' **********Under another arrangement, Mr. Gensler said, Vodafone could buy the whole company and then enter into a joint operating agreement with Bell Atlantic for Airtouch's domestic operations. **********''Bell Atlantic could be a huge winner without having to buy the assets,'' he said. But, he warned, ''There is a chance that Airtouch would get less than a full price in a bidding war if Bell Atlantic and Vodafone cut a deal without them.''"

Convention","Increasing Foreign Aid Would Help Prevent Wars, Clinton Tells V.F.W.

The warm greeting was notable for a President whose avoidance of service in Vietnam upset many veterans during the 1992 campaign, and this was the first time that he had addressed the annual gathering. **********''Standing by our military and standing by our veterans means more than preparing for war,'' he said. ''We must work with equal determination to prevent wars.'' **********Describing the military as ''only one arrow in our quiver,'' Mr. Clinton said the nation must do more to promote world stability. Conditions around the world will be safer, he said, ''if Congress will invest only a tiny percentage of what we spend on defense in avoiding war.'' **********In particular, he called for spending to rebuild Yugoslavia in the aftermath of the NATO bombing campaign over the situation in Kosovo. But he said that it would require nothing ''as ambitious as the Marshall Plan,'' and that European countries should bear the heaviest costs. **********Without efforts to promote stability in the Balkans, he said, ''make no mistake -- there will be another bloody war.'' **********He also said America should help pay for highly trained Russian weapons scientists to ''turn that expertise to peaceful projects.'' Otherwise, he said, those scientists, now earning less than $100 a month, might be tempted to market their expertise to groups or nations that would threaten world peace. **********Mr. Clinton is expected to ask Congress in September for an additional $2 billion to $3 billion for Kosovo peacekeeping and other foreign policy initiatives, Congressional staff members said. **********But he is still likely to veto a measure that will come out of a House-Senate conference in September on foreign aid. Although the House and Senate bills passed this summer differ in their details, both reduced the Administration's overall request by nearly $2 billion, to about $12.7 billion. **********The House withheld $500 million that the Clinton Administration had requested to help peace negotiations in the Middle East; the Senate withheld $350 million. Both chambers eliminated $241 million for reducing nuclear weapons threats in Russia. **********Mr. Clinton noted that President Truman stood before the veterans in 1949, when the group was marking its 50th anniversary, and similarly called for building better relations with other countries as a way to avoid war. **********''Harry Truman said, 'Peace, with freedom and justice, cannot be bought cheaply,' '' Mr. Clinton said. '' 'It can only be assured by the combined efforts of the multitudes of people throughout the world who want a secure peace. We must keep them our friends, if the world is to be a decent place for our children and their grandchildren to live.' '' **********Mr. Clinton repeatedly thanked the veterans for their heroism in battle and their determination to do their duty. ''If you ask who has been most responsible for making this the American century,'' he said, ''that answer would be America's servicemen and women.'' He also thanked the group for supporting the involvement of American troops in Kosovo. **********More than half of the world's people now live under freely elected governments, he said. Tens of millions of people around the world live in peace, he added, because so many thousands of American veterans ''rest in peace,'' after giving their lives in battle. **********The President said the military was facing a harder time recruiting and keeping its best troops, largely because the strong economy offered so many appealing options to young people. **********He also said military leaders would face hard choices about expensive equipment. But he said that the military must remain strong and that people who join the service should be treated fairly. **********He noted plans for new veterans' hospitals and cemeteries. And, in his only reference to Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Clinton said Mr. Gore had pledged to keep the American military strong in the years to come and to improve conditions for troops. ''We know there is more to do,'' the President said. **********The biggest threats to peace in the 21st century, Mr. Clinton said, are likely to be ethnic rivalries, terrorist groups and the spread of nuclear and biological weapons. He added that financial vulnerability around the globe could touch off violence. **********Mr. Clinton also defended the role of the United States in the United Nations, saying Washington was obligated to pay its fair share of dues. **********The Senate has approved authorizing more than $800 million in back dues, but the House has not passed financing to cover the payments. Conservative Republicans have balked at paying the dues, and last year they saddled the legislation with anti-abortion provisions that led Mr. Clinton to veto the bill. **********The overdue amount is also in dispute, with the United Nations arguing that it is owed $1.6 billion and the Administration saying the arrears are closer to $1 billion. **********When dealing with a foreign crisis, like the one in the Balkans, Mr. Clinton said today, it is far better to have the help of other countries than to carry the burden alone. **********The President also said it was a disgrace that so many American veterans had become homeless. ''They should be brought back into the society they did so much to defend,'' he said."

But he was acquitted, and since then, Mr. Nkabinde has been elected the Secretary General of his party, which was formed by two prominent politicians, one black and one white, in the hope of developing support across racial lines. **********After Mr. Nkabinde was expelled from the A.N.C., a violent turf battle developed around him in Richmond. Dozens of people died in what appeared to be a tit-for-tat exchange between A.N.C. supporters and those still loyal to Mr. Nkabinde. **********Although Mr. Nkabinde was not popular with the A.N.C., President Nelson Mandela issued a statement today saying ''the Government will leave no stone unturned'' in search of his killers. **********Mr. Nkabinde was gunned down by several assailants shortly before 8 A.M. as he left the Bridgeway Supermarket, accompanied by his bodyguard and his bodyguard's mother, who were both wounded, police officials said. **********The police said more than 60 shell casings were found at the scene. Mr. Nkabinde's car, a silver BMW, had 33 bullet holes. The car apparently used by the assailants was found about 20 minutes after the shooting, parked in a cemetery. **********By afternoon, the head of Mr. Nkabinde's party, Bantu Holomisa, had arrived in Richmond and condemned the shooting as ''barbaric.'' He said there could be no doubt that the killing was politically motivated, but did not say who was responsible. **********Around Richmond, the mood was tense. In 1997, shortly after Mr. Nkabinde was expelled from the A.N.C., murders were so frequent that the Government sent in the army to patrol the area. **********When Mr. Nkabinde was arrested, things quieted down. But after his release, more violence followed. Finally the Government transferred all the local police officers from Richmond, in an effort to stop what officials believed was police complicity with Mr. Nkabinde."

A room rate can differ significantly on any given day, depending on such variables as the current occupancy level, discounts invoked, and even the ability or inclination of a customer to haggle. **********Comparison shopping on the Internet makes this process easier. But until recently, many hotel companies were not enthusiastic about setting up stalls in the raucous on-line bazaar. This left marketing openings for fast-growing Internet booking wholesalers like the much-touted Hotel Reservations Network, a company that buys hotel rooms in bulk and then sells them on its Web site (www.180096hotel.com) at discounts that it contends are from 30 percent to as much as 65 percent off regular ''rack'' rates. **********Now the front-desk bell is ringing for the hidebound hotel industry. Hotel-room sales on the Internet are expected to double to about $1.1 billion this year from 1998, and hotel companies expect Internet sales to account for 10 percent of all bookings within five years. That's according to PhoCusWright Inc., a travel-research company that did a survey at 16 major hotel companies representing more than 50 hotel brands and 20,000 individual properties, and found that those companies sharply increased investment last year in their own Web sites, to an average of $20 million each. **********PhoCusWright anticipates that this surge will accelerate sharply, as the hotel industry begins to appreciate the way that the Internet is forcing fundamental changes in the millennia-old relationship between innkeeper and customer. **********Last year, according to the research company, the United States hotel industry raised room prices an average of 4.4 percent, while the average occupancy rate slipped slightly to 64 percent and the total supply of rooms rose 4 percent. Given these realities, and the ruthless competition posed by the on-line booking intermediaries, hotels are going to have to spend more, and devise creative on-line marketing strategies, to cultivate the growing numbers of savvy on-line customers who are markedly less loyal to brand names, said Lorraine Sileo, PhoCusWright's vice president for information services. **********''Hotels are realizing that they are being mediated for the first time'' by on-line customers able to easily compare location, quality, services, amenities and especially price, she said. **********Customers obviously like on-line service, as shown by the intermediary booking companies' success. But caveat emptor, as always. Here are two recent experiences with pre-paying for hotel rooms through an intermediary, in this case the Hotel Reservations Network. **********For a business trip to San Francisco, Hotel Reservations Network delivered a bargain: the Mark Hopkins Hotel at $189 a night (about $60 off the regular seasonal rate). This included an unexpected on-arrival upgrade to a bigger room on a limited-access floor at the famous hotel on Nob Hill. **********For another business trip, last March, the Hotel Reservations Network charged $102 a night for a room at the nondescript but comfortable Clarion Airport Hotel adjacent to Miami International Airport. At check-in, however, the same room was available for $69.75 to anyone walking in cold. The desk clerk confirmed that rooms were available. **********A letter to the Hotel Reservations Network in Dallas complaining about the price discrepancy (and enclosing a hotel printout that a helpful clerk supplied showing the $69.75 rate) brought a curt and bewildering response. **********''The rate printed on the hotel receipt is our wholesale rate and not a public rate,'' wrote a Hotel Reservations Network customer-service agent. ''The public hotel rate for the date of your stay was $119.95 per night due to a high occupancy demand at the hotel at the time of your booking. I am not able to issue credit since the rate you paid has already been discounted from the hotel rate.'' **********That reply brought to mind the comedian Richard Pryor's classic line of indignant response: ''Who you gonna believe? Me or your lying eyes?'' **********Another Fare Increase **********The major United States carriers have raised domestic air fares 4 percent in the industry's third increase this year. **********Northwest Airlines, a frequent holdout when fares are increased, on Monday matched last Friday's fare rise by Continental Airlines. That was followed by UAL's United Airlines, AMR's American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, U S Airways and Trans World Airlines. **********If all the airlines stick to the fare increase, domestic fares will have risen 11 percent this year. Business-class tickets will not be affected by the most recent price increases. **********Glenn Engel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that the fare increases were ''symptoms of strong demand.'' **********Airlines are prohibited from working together to set fares but for competitive reasons often follow moves made by rivals. More than a dozen attempts to raise fares last year failed because Northwest would not go along."

The plane crashed, killing 43 people, after a disgruntled employee of the airline shot his former supervisor, the pilot and the co-pilot. **********United States Aviation had been the lead insurer for the commuter airline, which had been taken over by USAir before the crash, and for the Ogden -Allied Corporation, which was in charge of security at Los Angeles International Airport, where the employee boarded the plane with a gun. **********Prosecutors argued that United States Aviation tried to shift most of the blame for the crash to USAir and away from the security firm. United States Aviation, the prosecutors said, had passed along most of its USAir coverage to other insurers, but it had retained millions in liability for Ogden Allied. The Government accused United States Aviation of engaging in criminal activity through the mail. **********United States Aviation, which industry experts said had a reputation as an unusually aggressive opponent in claims disputes, had argued from the start of the case that Brooklyn was the wrong venue. But the Government contended that because mail sent from the insurer's Manhattan offices traveled through either LaGuardia or Kennedy International airports, which are in the Eastern District, the case could be tried there. Prosecutors said that even if the case should have been brought in the Southern District, little harm had been done. The appeals court disagreed. **********In addition to the venue issue, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan said the Government's case was seriously flawed in other ways. **********The court said it was not clear, as the Government contended, whether the insurer, a subsidiary of the General Re Corporation, a unit of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., should have disclosed a conflict of interest between Ogden Allied and USAir. It also said that there was 'strong reason to think'' that the lower court's instructions to the jury had been incorrect, and it raised doubts about the Government's charge that United States Aviation had lied to the airline and other insurers. **********The court reached a conclusion only on the matter of venue, but it said that its other reservations would ''give rise to serious questions on a further appeal.'' **********Charles F. Barr, the general counsel for General Re, and Gerard E. Lynch, who represented John Brennan, the former United States Aviation chairman, in the appeal, said they were ''very pleased'' with the decision. Mr. Barr said he was particularly pleased by the court's observation that the prosecution's case '' 'appears seriously problematic in several respects.' '' **********In Brooklyn, William Muller, a spokesman for United States Attorney Zachary W. Carter, who prosecuted the case, would say only that the decision was ''under review and we are considering our options.'' **********When the conviction was announced in 1996, Harold J. Clark, who succeeded Mr. Brennan as chairman after he retired, said it had ''criminalized routine, good-faith business decisions.''"

He estimated that some 520,000 of them live in Poland today. **********Since World War II ended, the German Government has paid out 140 billion marks, or about $80 billion at current exchange rates, in war reparations and aid, much of it to Jews who fled Germany or suffered in concentration camps. But Mr. Walendziak said only one percent of such funds have gone to former forced laborers living in Central and Eastern Europe, which became part of the Soviet bloc after 1945. **********Mr. Walendziak flew to Washington for talks at the State Department just days after a top aide to the German Chancellor was in Washington and confirmed the intention of Germany's Government and major corporations to compensate forced laborers and thus address a wave of class action lawsuits over the issue. **********Any such program must recognize obligations to Poles and other non-Jews, Mr. Walendziak said. ''These issues must be resolved once and for all so that they bring the issue to a closure, not to another problem,'' he said. ''We certainly expect the results to be meaningful compensation to people who were victims of forced labor.'' **********Mr. Walendziak spoke after a two-hour meeting on Friday with Stuart E. Eizenstat, the State Department's Under Secretary for Business and Economic Affairs, who has been active in Holocaust-related issues. **********Days earlier, Bodo Hombach, top aide to  Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, was in Washington and said the German Government had agreed to establish a compensation fund financed by major German manufacturers, banks and others intended to resolve Holocaust-era claims against German industry. **********During the last year, several class-action lawsuits have been brought against dozens of German companies, including Volkswagen, Siemens and Deutsche Bank. The lawsuits allege, among other things, that the companies profited from the use of forced labor or assets seized from Jews and other Nazi victims. **********Mr. Hombach did not discuss details of the plan, which is still taking shape. But a translated copy of a discussion paper circulated by German officials and obtained by The New York Times states that the initiative is intended to ''respond to the moral obligations'' of German companies and to create a basis for dealing ''with class actions in the U.S.A. and to scotch any plans for a boycott.'' **********According to the document, an early working draft of proposed ideas, the German initiative foresees devoting funds to compensation of Nazi victims, including forced laborers, and to international ''remembrance'' programs involving groups in Germany, the United States, Israel and Europe. **********Those in need would have priority for compensation, the working draft says. It says the money should go to victims of forced labor deported from occupied countries and used in German industry as ''concentration camp prisoners or under prison-like conditions.'' **********''The funds should provide them with a measure of moral redress and material assistance,'' the proposal states. **********The term ''forced'' laborer typically applies to non-Jews deported to Germany from Poland, Russia or other Eastern European countries. Concentration camp prisoners who were used by German industry are generally referred to by historians as slave laborers. **********Forced laborers outnumbered slave laborers about ten to one. Many slave laborers, about half of whom were Jewish, starved or perished otherwise during the war. **********When announced by Mr. Hombach, the German initiative was greeted warmly by leaders of the World Jewish Congress, a New York-based group active in Holocaust compensation issues. But it may face hurdles. **********Both German companies and Government officials seek to avoid the protracted battle that Swiss banks engaged in before resolving claims that they profited from the assets of Jews and other Holocaust victims. But the Germans also face demands from a broader class of claimants like forced laborers, and from Holocaust survivors or their heirs seeking payments from German banks and European insurers. **********The Polish Government, for one, has closely allied itself with several of the class-action lawyers who were active in the Swiss banks litigation. Mr. Walendziak says he foresees a role for those lawyers in any negotiations, which the Germans hope will result in all class action lawsuits being dropped. **********''It is possible that this is going to be resolved through political negotiations,'' he said. ''But I emphasize that this is going to happen with the assistance of attorneys.'' **********Both Mr. Hombach and Mr. Eizenstat assured him that the Polish position would be taken into account, Mr. Walendziak said. **********Mr. Eizenstat said in a telephone interview that the German initiative would address both forced and slave labor, although immediate emphasis was on slave laborers. **********Emphasizing the financial need of various victims may slow distribution of any funds made available by the Germans. **********For several decades, one group associated with the World Jewish Congress, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, has negotiated reparation payments for Nazi survivors based on income levels. The group, which has a proposed role in the new initiative, has been criticized by some groups for taking years to approve payments."

People with direct knowledge of the investigation said this week that documents found in Ms. Edwards's London home indicated that she had used the Bank of New York name for dealings unrelated to her job at the bank. **********The bank's action against Ms. Edwards, 41, who was in charge of the East European division in its London office, suggests that it found her partly responsible for the alleged money laundering operation. She has not been formally accused of wrongdoing by Government authorities. **********Still, her dismissal leaves open the question of the bank's own responsibility -- specifically, how senior bank officers could have remained ignorant of such a large-scale operation for more than a year. **********The bank has said that it has been cooperating with American authorities for several months, but it has declined public discussion of its dealings in Russia. It continues to operate as usual. Since it acknowledged the investigation on Aug. 18, its stock has dropped $2.37 a share, closing yesterday at $35.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Ms. Edwards, who lived in Queens before moving to London a few years ago, was placed on leave, with pay, on Aug. 19, a few hours after The New York Times asked the bank questions about the alleged money-laundering operation. **********Her supervisor, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, was also placed on leave, and the bank has taken no further action against her, officials close to the inquiry said yesterday. **********Ms. Kagalovsky and her husband, Konstantin, ''wish to state unequivocally that they have never been involved in money laundering in any way, shape or form,'' they said in a statement issued by their lawyer, Stanley Arkin. ''Nor do they have any knowledge of such activity,'' the statement read. Ms. Kagalovsky has declined to comment, but yesterday in Moscow a business newspaper published an extensive interview with Mr. Kagalovsky. Ms. Kagalovsky was in London yesterday, according to a person who spoke with her. **********Investigators have seized documents revealing that $4.2 billion passed through the accounts at the bank, which were in the name of a company controlled by Ms. Edwards's husband, Peter Berlin. **********Ms. Edwards vouched for Mr. Berlin when he opened the accounts, in the name of a company called Benex, but the bank was not aware that he was her husband, according to people close to the investigation. **********Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin have not been seen by neighbors in their West London neighborhood since the scandal broke a week ago, and could not be located. **********When Mr. Berlin registered Benex Worldwide Ltd. in Britain last year, he gave his address as Narrowsburg, N.Y., where, public records show, he and Ms. Edwards own property. **********Benex was a trading company, set up principally to move money from Russia to other places around the world, investigators say. **********American and British investigators have linked Mr. Berlin to Sem yon Mogilevich, who American and British authorities say is one of the major organized-crime leaders in Russia. **********Investigators say Mr. Mogilevich is a master at laundering his money, which officials say comes from prostitution, drug running, arms trafficking and extortion. **********Efforts to find Mr. Mogilevich in recent weeks have been unsuccessful, even for Western law enforcement agencies. In an interview with a Hungarian newspaper in June, he denied that he was engaged in any illegal activities. **********Investigators say they do not believe that all of the billions of dollars that passed through the Benex accounts at the Bank of New York came from Mr. Mogilevich. They also believe that the accounts were used to disguise money that Russian politicians and business people wanted to get out of the country without disclosing its source or destination. **********Ms. Edwards was born in Leningrad in 1958, as Lyudmila Pritzker, according to a relative. When she was 19, she met an American merchant seaman, and they moved to Illinois. **********Ten years later she and her husband separated, and she moved to New York. **********She began working for the bank in 1988. **********She was well regarded by bank officials and competitors, for her ability to bring in Russian business. An officer at another bank, who often saw her in Russia, described her as professional and spunky. **********She was also, apparently, an expert on money laundering. In June she was a featured speaker at a conference in Riga, Latvia. Her topic was ''Money Laundering: Latest Developments and Regulations.''"

GTE said it would be cheaper for the combined company to push across the nation. The slower expansion plan, combined with increased competition in its wireless and traditional phone businesses, will cut revenue growth this year at GTE to less than 10 percent, down from the 10 percent to 12 percent it previously expected. **********''They're going to get more aggressive on costs to offset what they won't pick up in revenue growth,'' said William Deatherage, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, who rates GTE ''attractive.'' **********The company said it would announce more details about the job cuts later this quarter. **********GTE said it was focusing on selling more services to existing customers rather than spending to expand into new markets. Customers who buy several services from a phone company spend more each month and are less likely to switch to a competitor, analysts said. **********''Though it will lead to slower revenue growth, it will be more profitable revenue growth,'' Mr. Deatherage said. **********GTE said it will take a charge for the job cuts this quarter, though the charge will be offset by a gain of $300 million from the merger of the Telus Corporation and BC Telecom Inc. of Canada. GTE owned 51 percent of BC Telecom. **********Shares of GTE rose $5.375, to $67.875. Shares of Bell Atlantic gained $4.75, to $57.875."

This sort of marketing has been used successfully for years by companies like Amway and Mary Kay to sell low-ticket, repeat-purchase items like cleaning products and cosmetics. Its success is unproven, however, for bigger-ticket items like computers. **********Multilevel structures, of course, have to worry about oversaturation. ''At some point, all the potential customers will be sales representatives and there will be no more customers,'' said David C. Schmittlein, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''Then the next person won't be able to make a go of it.'' **********As it is, Hand's representatives sold, on average, fewer than three computers each last year. Yet the notion behind the business  has been irresistible to many would-be entrepreneurs: Sell computers to people you know with Hand's support, recruit your own workers, maybe even get some stock options if and when the company goes public. **********A salesman in Santa Clarita, Calif., Todd P. Smith, a producer of the movie ''Lost and Found,'' starring David Spade, has built a team of 1,000 Hand sales representatives dubbed Team One. In the process, Mr. Smith has become a Hand icon. **********After hearing Mr. Smith and top Hand officials speak at the company's annual conference in Dallas a year ago, Keith Campbell, who lives in Seattle, resolved to quit his job at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In that job, he sometimes paged through computer magazines while waiting for the next big disaster, he said, and he decided to build his own computer business based around Hand. **********''I wouldn't have walked away from a $50,000-a-year job with 30 days' paid vacation if I didn't think this was going to go,'' he said. ''Most people would say I'm crazy, but I don't think so. Ten years ago if somebody said I was going to buy a Dell, people would have said, 'A what?' Now everybody knows. We're going to sell a lot of computers.'' **********Mr. Campbell quit the disaster agency in June to try selling for Hand full-time. His goal is to sell one computer a week and add two technology consultants a month. The first year will be hard, he figures, but he hopes to eventually have a big-enough team to sell enough computers to replace his old income. He started building his 11-member team after last year's conference, he said, understanding that he would not get rich quick. ''With Hand, you get out of it what you put into it,'' he said. **********SHOLNN FREEMAN"

Ed Vega, spokesman for the Army. **********Defense Department officials said there are no plans to conduct a far-reaching investigation. In the absence of archival records, the Pentagon would have to undertake a major research project pulling records, interviewing Korean and American witnesses and cross-checking the information with other documents in order to find evidence about the incident. **********Military and academic historians interviewed said they were not surprised that civilians were killed in the early months of the Korean War, although they disagreed about the meaning of the findings. **********Bruce Cumings of the University of Chicago, who first wrote about reports of an incident near the bridge in his book ''The Origins of the Korean War, Volume II'' (Princeton, 1990), said he relied in part on the contemporary reporting of Walter Sullivan in The New York Times. **********Though in his July 22, 1950, article about the fighting, Mr. Sullivan did not report the killing of civilians, he did write this: ''The American G.I. is now beginning to eye with suspicion any Korean civilian in the cities or countryside. Watch those guys in white! -- the customary peasant dress -- is the cry often heard near the front.'' **********Through the diary of a dead Korean soldier and United States military records, Mr. Cumings said he had showed that Korean civilians had died during American aerial bombardments. **********This bombardment and strafing could have driven the civilians to take refuge under the bridge. Mr. Cumings said that The Associated Press reporting ''makes it unquestionable that tens or hundreds of Koreans were killed by Americans.'' **********William Stueck, a history professor at the University of Georgia and author of ''The Korean War: an International History'' (Princeton, 1995), said that since there was infiltration of United States lines by enemy troops posing as civilians, the reaction of United States soldiers was predictable. **********Assuming the incident happened, Mr. Stueck said, ''it wouldn't surprise me that American soldiers were very sensitive to that.'' **********It is a violation of the rule of law for the military to use civilians to mask their operations in war. **********Both Mr. Stueck and Mr. Cumings said there was no previous report of any atrocity of this magnitude by United States forces in the Korean War. They and other historians noted that the many atrocities committed during the conflict were largely by Koreans against each other."

''I asked myself, 'What did I get into?' '' **********The Whitehorse Rifle and Pistol Club used the range beneath the gym since the school was built in 1952. There were no accidents, but after someone broke into the school and stole a few guns, some parents complained. The Yukon government was forced to ask the club to leave in 1994, but not before offering about $100,000  to help build a big new clubhouse on nearby Grey Mountain. **********The accommodating attitude that allowed the range to operate in the school for so long remains strong throughout the vast Canadian west, making this area the focus of a civil disobedience movement that is extraordinary for a country as law- abiding as Canada. **********The catalyst is a sweeping new gun-control law, one of the toughest and most comprehensive anywhere. The law, which took effect Dec. 1, requires all three million gun owners to be licensed, and every one of the estimated seven million rifles and handguns in Canada to be registered. Sales or gifts of easily concealed pistols are banned, though current owners can keep the ones they have, and officials are given broad discretion to deny licenses and to search homes for weapons. **********It is no surprise that such a bill, long advocated by gun-control forces in Canada (and in the United States), would bring out civil libertarians who see a Government plot to confiscate private weapons. **********But the remarkable aspect is that thousands of normally dispassionate Canadians are proclaiming their intention to break the law. Mostly older gun owners who were exempt from previous registration requirements, they are refusing to register before the Jan. 1, 2003, deadline. **********''It's time for Canadians to stand up to government and say, 'This is an unjust and immoral law, and we're not going to obey it,' '' said R. Bruce Hutton, a former officer with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who founded a group called the Law-Abiding Unregistered Firearms Association. Since its first meeting in November, the group has grown to 7,000 members, mostly in the west. **********Here in Whitehorse, an old mining town on the Yukon River, gun owners who have never been involved in anti-gun-control politics before say the new legislation is forcing them to take a new look at things. Lyle Thompson is one of them. **********''There's a terrific resentment here against registration, and the biggest reason for that is that people don't trust the Government,'' said Mr. Thompson, 57, who owns a local Shell gasoline station and who has been hunting since he was a child. ''I know that sounds radical, and 10 years ago I would have said it will never happen because this is Canada, people here can vote. But I've changed my mind.'' **********Mr. Thompson, the vice president of the Whitehorse Rifle and Pistol Club, has no intention of registering any one of his 16 firearms until the very last minute, if then. Instead he has jumped into local politics and is now director of the local chapter of the Reform Party, which opposes this gun-control law. **********Although polls routinely show that most Canadians, including gun owners, want some form of control, opposition to the new law is strong. **********Federal officials in Ottawa and gun-control advocates across Canada insist that while the law will make it costlier for some Canadians to acquire arms, it will not hinder the right of most to own a gun. **********''There's nothing in the law that prevents people from using guns for legitimate purposes,'' said Wendy L. Cukier, a professor of justice studies at Ryerson Polytechnic University. She helped found the Coalition for Gun Control, which was instrumental in the passage of the new law. **********But as important as gun control is, there is more to this controversy. **********At the heart of it, the imposition of national regulations revives lingering resentments that in the past have led to a secessionist movement in the west and gave rise to the Reform Party and other organizations that channel feelings of alienation. **********''This law might make sense in urban Toronto, but it sure doesn't make sense out here in the west,'' said Mr. Thompson. In Ontario, about 15 percent of households have a firearm; in Yukon, the percentage is close to 70. **********Even provincial governments in the west resent what they see as Ottawa's meddling. Yukon joined Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories in challenging the constitutionality of the gun-control legislation, arguing that regulations governing property are the jurisdiction of the provinces, not the federal Government. **********In a split decision, the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the law, but the provinces and territories have sought a ruling from the Supreme Court of Canada. **********In Canada all revolvers and pistols have had to be registered since 1934, the same year the first gun-control laws were passed in the United States. Canadian gun-control laws have always been national; in the United States, individual states have their own laws, and Federal regulations, like the recent ban on automatic weapons, are overlaid on these. And the Constitution in Canada, unlike that in the United States, does not include a right to bear arms. **********In 1989 a particular incident hardened feelings in parts of eastern Canada against gun ownership. That Dec. 5, Marc Lepine used a Ruger 14 automatic rifle to kill 14 women, systematically, at the Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal before turning the weapon on himself. The reaction was harsh and swift, with calls for universal gun registration and a stricter licensing system. **********But David A. Tomlinson, president of the National Firearms Association, said the result was a ''cockamamie system'' that will cost millions to carry out and will not reduce crime. Mr. Tomlinson is encouraging the association's 100,000 members to follow the new law, to the letter, by inundating agents with questions and filing so many submissions that the system breaks down. **********The new Canadian Firearms Center, set up to handle the registrations, has received 49,932 applications for registration or licenses since Dec. 1, when the system took effect. There were the normal delays involved in a new system, but Hana Hruska, spokesman for the center, said 30,788 of the applications had been processed. **********Professor Cukier, of the Coalition for Gun Control, said the threats of civil disobedience by western gun owners follow a pattern that arose with other restrictive laws, like those requiring seat belts. Eventually, she said, most people conform. **********But even if they do resist, she said, she doubts whether unregistered gun owners would be sent to jail. ''The more likely outcome, ironically, is that they will simply lose their firearms'' because the police will confiscate unregistered guns, she said. **********For people here in the west, where youngsters learn to ice-skate at 2 and shoot at 5, the new law looms like a huge shadow cast by Ottawa. **********''I never used the words 'civil disobedience' in my paper until about six months ago,'' said Paul F. Rogan, a Whitehorse gunsmith who also publishes a newsletter called Canadian Access to Firearms. Mr. Rogan, a professed civil libertarian, rants against Government interference. **********''The Canadian press presents us falsely as pseudo-anarchists who don't want gun legislation of any kind,'' Mr. Rogan said. ''That's not true. What we resent, what we don't accept, is legislation that affects not the criminals but law-abiding citizens.'' **********Mr. Rogan believes the new law will not reduce crime or prevent assaults on women, nor will it create a system that will be useful to the police, as proponents claim. What it will do, he said, is create a huge black market. **********''The joke in Whitehorse today is that the biggest gun shop in town is the Tim Horton's,'' he said, referring to the local doughnut shop. ''People do their gun dealing now with a cup of coffee and a doughnut. They've got the feeling that no matter what they do, they're going to break some law because they don't understand it.''"

EMC's products are designed for the largest mainframe computers, while Data General's are aimed at smaller midrange computers that typically run the Unix or Windows NT operating systems. **********The explosive growth of the Internet has significantly increased demand for both categories -- but especially for midrange computers -- for use as servers, the powerful machines that provide products like World Wide Web sites and E-mail for millions of users. **********Data General, the once-scrappy minicomputer maker profiled in Tracy Kidder's best-selling book, ''The Soul of a New Machine,'' has in recent years derived an ever-larger portion of its revenues from its Clariion line of storage products for mid-range computers. **********After the acquisition, EMC said, Data General's computer systems business, Aviion, will operate as a separate unit. **********The deal values Data General's shares at $19.58, 48 percent higher than they closed on Friday. **********EMC shares closed at $57, down $3, and Data General shares closed at $17.4375, up $4.25, both on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Analysts said the acquisition fit EMC's strategy of broadening its product offerings away from the mainframe market to embrace a broader range of customers -- primarily those that run network servers and other midsize computer systems. Although Data General's financial results have suffered in the last two years from tactical miscues and management issues, analysts said the company's products remained strong and would benefit from EMC's more robust sales structure. **********''Data General has been going through a major program during the past year to beef up their direct sales activities,'' said Jim Porter, an analyst with Disk Trend, in Mountain View, Calif., noting that the company had previously sold most of its storage products to computer systems manufacturers rather than to users. **********''Direct sales is an EMC specialty, so this is going to make a fundamental change in how Data General does business,'' Mr. Porter said. **********The merger brings together two of the largest technology companies in Massachusetts, with EMC based in Hopkinton and Data General in Westboro. Along with the Digital Equipment Corporation and Prime Computer, Data General started the minicomputer revolution and helped spark the ''Massachusetts Miracle'' of the 1980's. Slow to catch the shift from minicomputers to servers, Data General lagged behind companies like the International Business Machines Corporation, Sun Microsystems and the Hewlett-Packard Company in the 1990's but built a strong franchise in data storage. **********The acquisition allows EMC to broaden its market much more rapidly than it could by developing its own line of midsize storage devices,  Michael C. Ruettgers, EMC's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. **********''They've been selling Clariion for some time now, so it is a fairly well-known product in the marketplace,'' he said. ''The reason it hasn't been more successful is it never had all the software to make it more useful. We have that software. And, more importantly, we have the largest direct-selling storage sales force in the world and the best storage service organization in the world.'' **********Mr. Ruettgers said the pooling-of-interests structure of the acquisition made it impossible to spin off the server business for the next two years. But he added that EMC was interested in applying Aviion's NUMA technology, a method for having multiple processors use a common supply of memory, in its storage management products. **********''The only other company that had that technology was Sequent, which was just acquired by I.B.M.,'' he said. **********Mr. Porter of Disk Trend said that Data General had been a pioneer in moving its product line from storage devices that send and receive computer data over the small computer systems interface, or SCSI (pronounced SKUZ-ee) channel, to a faster technology called fiber channel. But the company may have moved faster than its market, causing its storage sales to flatten in the last two years. **********''They moved away from SCSI a little ahead of the pack, and this bold gamble did not pay off because they got there too early,'' Mr. Porter said. ''But now, fiber channel is becoming a major part of the high-end market.''"

SBC recently completed its acquisition of the Ameritech Corporation, the Midwestern telephone giant, making SBC the local phone provider for about a third of the nation's roughly 100 million households. That deal made SBC the nation's No. 1 local telephone company, at least until the Bell Atlantic Corporation completes its merger with the GTE Corporation. **********During the last few years, the cable television industry has taken the lead in delivering continuous high-speed Internet links to United States consumers, now serving perhaps one million households. Encouraged by the prospects of using cable systems to deliver not only Internet access but also interactive television and local phone service, the AT&T Corporation has agreed to spend more than $90 billion to become the No. 1 cable carrier. **********The big local phone companies appear to have paid more attention to merging with one another and fighting regulatory battles to win entry to the long-distance market than to the cable industry. They now appear to have deployed D.S.L. to fewer than 100,000 customers. But that may be changing. Bell Atlantic recently began offering D.S.L. in New York City and SBC under its new plan intends to double the percentage of its customers with access to the technology. In its last D.S.L. announcement, in January, SBC committed to offering D.S.L. to only 40 percent of its customers. **********According to analysts and executives close to SBC, the company plans to spend about $4.5 billion on D.S.L. systems provided mostly by Alcatel of France and on replacing some copper lines into local networks with fiber-optic systems. The other $1.5 billion will be spent mostly on deploying advanced transmission systems in the core of the company's network, using a technology called asynchronous transfer mode. The technology splits communications into small pieces called cells. **********While spending on the new plan, known as Project Pronto, could dilute SBC's earnings during the next few years, executives close to the company expect the project to generate $3.5 billion in annual revenue and $1.5 billion in annual savings by 2004."

In December, prices rose only one-tenth of a percent as declines in gasoline and home heating oil prices offset higher cigarette prices. **********Retail sales rose 5.1 percent in 1998, topping the 4.3 percent increase in 1997, the Commerce Department said today. Near-record sales at the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler A.G. and other auto makers, and double-digit sales increases at furniture and home improvement stores pushed December sales nine-tenths of a percent higher. **********''We have seldom experienced what we have now: low unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation,'' said Gary Thayer, an economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''Consumers were out there taking advantage of it.'' **********A separate Labor Department report showed that average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation rose half a percent in December and 1.8 percent for 1998. **********''With inflation going down, especially in the goods area, real spending has been phenomenally strong,'' said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. **********Auto makers reported that unit sales of autos and trucks rose 7 percent in December. That translated into a 2.5 percent increase in sales at automotive dealers, which also includes spending on auto repairs and parts. If autos were excluded, December sales rose four-tenths of a percent, the Commerce Department figures showed. **********The nation's strong housing market also played a role in last month's retail strength. Sales at building materials stores rose 1.3 percent, and furniture and household store sales increased six-tenths of a percent. **********In contrast, sales fell two-tenths of a percent at general merchandise stores and six-tenths of a percent at apparel stores. Analysts blamed warm weather at the beginning of December, which held down sales of winter merchandise and led retailers to cut prices. **********The Consumer Price Index report showed that the cost of apparel and upkeep fell eight-tenths of a percent in December, the biggest drop since August 1989. That depressed retail apparel sales, which are reported in dollars. ''It's more a price than sales problem,'' said David Orr, chief economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. **********Separately, the Labor Department reported that the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 352,000 in the week ended Saturday. **********That was likely depressed by the snowstorms that swept through the Midwest and East during that week, analysts said. The four-week average for new claims, watched by investors as a more reliable indicator of employment levels, rose to 342,250, from 329,250 the previous week. That is the highest since 360,500 in the week ended July 18, 1998."

''You can supply billions in foreign aid, as the Russians did, and still have minimal leverage. Ultimately Castro is a nationalist, and he decides what he thinks is best for Cuba.'' **********When Mr. Chretien visited Cuba in 1998, he presented a list of four political prisoners that he wanted Mr. Castro to release. But in March the  four were convicted of ''counterrevolutionary activities'' and sentenced to up to five years in jail. Canada-Cuba relations then sank to their lowest point since foreign aid was suspended in the mid-1980's because of Cuba's military involvement in Angola. **********Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy ordered a review of contacts with Cuba and the policy of constructive engagement that has been the basis of Canada's approach throughout the period that Cuba has been ruled by Fidel Castro's Communist Government. **********While the United States imposed an economic embargo on Cuba, Canada moved in the opposite direction, believing that the best way to bring about real democratic reform in the country was to maintain strong ties. Canada also believed that it could use its influence to prod Cuba into doing more to protect human rights of its citizens, particularly political prisoners. **********After the policy review was completed in April, Canada decided to continue trading with and doing business in Cuba. That commerce came to $555 million in 1998. **********But because of the serious flaws in Cuba's human rights record, Canada's foreign ministry believed that a tougher approach was needed, at least until Cuba responded positively to Canadian concerns. **********Mr. Axworthy had demanded that all Cabinet ministers with programs in Cuba clear any official visits through him, and he has decided that  planning for all visits should be suspended for now. That meant the indefinite postponement of trips by the International Trade Minister, Sergio Marchi, and the Minister of International Cooperation, Diane Marleau. **********Canada has given Cuba $24 million in foreign aid during the last five years. Officials say the funds have not been frozen completely but are subject to a case-by-case review. Several projects have already been suspended, including a plan to provide financial assistance to help Haiti cooperate in a medical development effort with Cuba. The Canadians fear that Cuba may use the medical research more for propaganda than humanitarian purposes. **********Canada has also backed away from a commitment to lobby for Cuba's integration into the hemisphere, particularly through participation in the Organization of American States, from which it was expelled in 1962.  Canada will be the host of the organization's general assembly next June."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/world/community-policing-taught-by-americans-in-kosovo.html,Carlotta Gall,1999-09-08,"American officials begin training cadets for Kosovo police force, with only one Serb among sea of Albanians; admit they are failing in efforts to create multiethnic force for province; 200 cadets, including 26 Serbs, were selected for or five week...",866,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Community Policing Taught By Americans in Kosovo,Community Policing Taught By Americans in Kosovo," **********Kosovo's police school began training its first cadets today, with only one Serb among a sea of Albanians. **********The American officials in charge conceded that they were failing to create a multiethnic force for the province. **********There were to have been 200 men and women starting five weeks of classes today in the former Serbian-run police school here in northern Kosovo. But of the 26 Serbs selected for the first course, only one showed up. **********It is not clear why the others did not appear, but the United States police officer in charge of recruitment, Garry Day, suggested that there may have been intimidation. **********''Coming from the U.S., I never realized what intimidation really means,'' he said as the recruits headed for the classrooms after hearing opening speeches. ''We will be sending people out straightaway to their homes to see why they did not turn up today. It may be first-day jitters.'' **********Some Serbian applicants were threatened, and even assaulted, he said. **********''Yet if they cannot manage to come today,'' he said, ''how are they going to cope with the job of being policemen?'' **********Selection for the Kosovo Police Service has been the school's thorniest problem, and it delayed the opening by a week. The absence of the Serbs on the first day was a reminder of the losing battle that peacekeepers are waging to create a multiethnic Kosovo. **********The first class, of 105 recruits, has ended up dominated by Albanians, more than half of the whom are former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Kosovo's other minorities are also poorly represented, with just four Turks and three Gypsies in the first class. There are more than 40 women, a fact the organizers are proud of. **********The men in charge of the training face an unusual task. They plan to train the recruits not only in normal police duties, but also in human rights and democracy, to create a new image for the police in Kosovo after so many years of rights abuse. **********''They have to change the way people think about the police in their country,'' the school's director, Steve Bennett, an ex-marine and former director of the Board on Public Safety Standards in Oregon, said of the recruits. ''They know that and they are proud of that.'' **********The school is run mainly by Americans but is part of a broad international effort to reconstruct Kosovo. **********The students will learn ''democratic policing,'' including lessons on community relations and human dignity, along with the more ordinary patrol duties and crime investigation, a training program document shows. **********After five weeks in the classroom, they will go through 19 weeks of field training, each patrolling the streets of Pristina alongside a United Nations police officer. The goal is to train a police force to take over when the United Nations force departs. **********The men and women selected have been given background checks, but Mr. Bennett said he expected some ''bad apples'' to emerge during the training. **********Four of the 30 Serbs originally selected were dropped because of accusations of involvement in war crimes. Some Albanian applicants were sidelined when allegations arose that 16 applicants, 13 of them Albanians, had worked for the Serbian secret service. Since the secret service was infamous for abuse, Mr. Bennett said, the men were passed over until further checks could be made. **********The number of Serbs who applied was disappointing, he said, but even one or two success stories may help others come forward in the future. ''One of the necessities is to mobilize the moderate majority of people of Kosovo who aren't being heard,'' he said. **********Recruitment is only one of the technical difficulties in postwar Kosovo. Police uniforms, donated by Denmark, have yet to arrive, so the recruits today were dressed in a motley mix of jeans and track suits. **********The school premises are rudimentary, and the weapons that the police will be trained to use, 9-millimeter Glock handguns to be donated by Austria, were also not in evidence. **********Nevertheless, the mood was optimistic. Many of the recruits were experienced men, in their 30's and 40's, and some served in the Yugoslav police force until 1989, before Albanians were dismissed from public service. They were glad to be back in a job. **********Two senior commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army were among the class, as well as a number of former members. They spoke of ''serving the people,'' a common refrain among fighters. **********''What distinguishes them is their military and police experience,'' Mr. Bennett said. Although there was no special quota for members of the separatist group, he said, they were promised due consideration. **********Among the class was Nejmeddin Kastrati, 28, a former Yugoslav Army officer and brigade commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The entry test was easy, he said, and working alongside Serbs will not pose a problem. **********''I do not think who and what someone is,'' he said. ''I am going into this as a professional. And of course they have not taken on the criminals, who will be dealt with in the international courts.'' **********Mr. Bennett, decked out in cowboy boots, said, ''There are a lot of things to be optimistic about.'' By next September he said he expected to have 3,500 police officers trained. ''In two years we will have provided the foundation,'' he said."

Ask anyone invested in Ecuador, where this week the government tried to stem a run on the banks by announcing a surprise two-day holiday. Ask anyone invested in Brazil, where so far this year the currency has plunged nearly 40 percent against the dollar. Indeed, ask anyone who invested in oil-dependent Venezuela over the past two years. **********It is enough to make a grown investor weep. But the sensible ones are drying their eyes and taking a new look. The International Monetary Fund's decision this week to back Brazil with a $41.5 billion credit line is the signal many professional investors have been waiting for. **********""Our emerging-markets team meets every morning,"" said Michael Hughes, director of business development at Asset Management in London, the day after the IMF decision was announced. ""Today was the first time since the emerging-market crisis started in Thailand and then spread that everyone at the table agreed that it had bottomed."" **********Fleming has $9 billion under management in emerging markets. Of that, $1.9 billion is in Latin America **********""We want to invest for the long-term in the best companies in the emerging markets and a lot of these are in Latin America,"" Mr. Hughes said. ""Brazil and Mexico are the most attractive as well as the biggest. All the bad news is already priced into Brazilian stocks and now the news is getting better. In Mexico, the top-line companies are run like American companies but still have emerging-market growth prospects."" **********No one is suggesting it will be smooth sailing. Brazil faces at least one more critical hurdle: a financial-transactions tax that the government is battling to get through Congress. The tax, known by the acronym CPMF, would generate 8 billion reals ($4.27 billion) this year if it is introduced on schedule by the end of June. A vote is slated for Wednesday. **********""It will be a disaster if the government doesn't get the CPMF,"" said Stephen Rose, managing director of UBB Capital Markets, an investment advisory firm in London. ""But the signs are that it will. There is a real feeling now in Brazil that the government, if not fully in the saddle, at least has a foot in the stirrups."" **********Brazil's sheer size means that many investors think Latin America and see Brazil. That is unfortunate, for the countries are quite different. Mexico, for example, is far more aligned economically with the United States than with Brazil. Worse still, in the eyes of some analysts, is the tendency of many investors to lump all the world's emerging markets together as one asset class. **********This makes it easy to think of the events of the past two years as caused by one great crisis, moving ever westward from Asia to Russia to Latin America. But the roots of Asia's woes โ excessive corporate debt and poor investment decisions โ were very different from those of Latin America. **********Brazil and its neighbors suffered because of excessive government debt and public-sector consumption. In Latin America, the governments were to blame, not the companies. ""Look at the average Korean company,"" said Mr. Hughes. ""It is riddled with debt. That is just not a big problem in Latin America."" **********Analysts at ING Barings pointed out in a recent report on emerging-market strategy that most Latin American companies have low price-to-book ratios and high dividend yields. ""At the corporate level, Latin America remains in rude health,"" they wrote. ""Regional valuations are hugely attractive, balance sheets are solid while earnings should show impressive resilience."" **********Commodities have played a leading role in Latin America's latest economic crisis. Desmond Lachman, emerging-market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney Inc., noted that much of Latin America remains far too dependent on commodities for export earnings. Asian demand for Chile's copper has shriveled, while rock-bottom oil prices have been disastrous for Venezuela. **********Therefore, the prognosis for Chilean companies, which are in many ways the best-run and most economically sophisticated in Latin America, is mixed. **********""We are seeing growth again in most Asian countries and there is even some signs that Japan is ready to get going again,"" said Mr. Lachman. ""If that happens, Chile will be a big beneficiary."" Until then, however, local investors are braced for a downturn. Chile is by far the world's largest producer of copper: Last year it produced about 4.2 million metric tons, worth about $5 billion at today's prices. Almost all of that was exported, with about 20 percent going to Japan. **********A few Chilean companies are exporting other things. ""Chilectra SA, the big electricity-generating company, is very good at buying stakes in newly privatized companies elsewhere in Latin America and helping boost their performance, "" said Lise Rubinstein, a Latin America investment analyst at Fleming Asset Management. Compania de Telecomunicaciones de Chile SA, known as CTC, is also looking beyond its borders for growth, notably in Brazil. This external focus makes both companies ""good long-term stories"" for investors, she said. **********- **********THERE CAN be potholes on the road to cross-border expansion, however. Argentinians are demanding compensation and for executives to be punished following a 10-day blackout in Buenos Aries at the height of summer last month that cause an estimated $900 million in damage. The buck is likely to stop with Chilectra, which runs Empresa Distribuidora Sur Sa, known as Edesur, the country's largest electricity distributor. **********Times are likely to stay tough in Venezuela, where petroleum accounts for 73 percent of exports and 44 percent of government revenues. Mr. Upton at Credit Suisse dismissed hopes that Venezuela's new president, Hugo Chavez, would be more investor-friendly than his populist background indicates, thus giving a lift to the markets. ""Venezuela's problems are oil, oil and oil,"" Mr. Upton said. ""It doesn't matter how orthodox the new government turns out to be: The country is overly dependent on oil."" **********Elsewhere, the outlook is rosier. ""Financial systems across the major regional economies are now in much more robust shape, compared with the post-Tequila period in 1995,"" the ING Barings analysts noted. ""Argentine banks, in particular, have ensured a prudent level of protection against the negative impacts of capital flight."" **********Banco de Galicia & Buenos Aries SA and Banco Frances SA are the two most-often cited as attractive by local analysts. Banco Frances is a favorite of international investors because it is partly owned by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya SA of Spain. **********Also appealing in Argentina are YPF SA and Perez Companc SA, the country's two biggest energy producers. No one expects petroleum prices to recover anytime soon, but both companies are busy improving profitability and cutting cost. **********""Repsol SA of Spain bought a 15 percent stake in YPF in January and may take it over while Perez is divesting many noncore assets and cleaning up its balance sheet,"" said Ms. Rubinstein. ""Both are good long-term buys."" **********Aside from well-run companies, there is a big reason to take another look at Latin America. Rapidly changing demographics in the industrial world mean that the number of people 65 or older will rise by 78 million, while the number of working people will fall by about 15 million in the next 25 years. But in the less-developed regions, including Latin America, the trend is completely different. The number of people aged 16 to 64 will rise by nearly 1.6 billion, or five times the number of retirees. **********Investors may know the story, but as they are buffeted by one emerging-markets crisis after another, they relegate the bigger picture to the back of their minds and focus on the more stable economies of Europe and North America. **********But corporations do not. They are investing for the long term and they know that their future markets are in what are now the emerging economies. Direct investment by foreign corporations into Brazil alone totaled almost $20 billion last year after rising steadily this decade, according to Fleming research. That is about 10 times the amount invested in any single year during the 1980s. **********""Foreign direct investment appears to be undiminished as a result of the problems affecting emerging stock markets,"" the Fleming research found. ""Indeed, the incredibly low asset prices now available appear to be causing a boom in mergers and acquisitions activity in emerging markets."" So why not just buy shares in the Western companies active in these markets, avoiding the currency risk and at least some of the other heartbreak associated with emerging-market investments? **********""Because you pay developed-market prices for emerging-market risk instead of emerging-market prices,"" said Mr. Hughes. ""Why buy Coca-Cola Co. when you can buy Panamerican Beverages Inc. at a fraction of the cost?"" Coca-Cola was trading at $66 per share this week, about 45 times its expected 1999 earnings. Panamerican Beverages is the largest soft-drink bottler in Latin America and one of the world's top Coca-Cola bottlers. It has operations in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua and Venezuela, and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where it fetched just under $17, or 23 times earnings **********Two major economic crises in one decade is enough to turn almost anyone off investing in Latin America. But it was the last emerging-market region to succumb to the 1997 global crisis and it shows every sign of being the first out. That, together with some great companies, makes it worth a close but careful look right now, analysts said **********""Most individuals should invest in these markets only through funds,"" advised Mr. Hughes. ""Anyone determined to do it on their own should find the best companies and stick with them. Don't trade a lot because that is the surest way to lose money in the emerging markets."""

Nobody produces more hours of prime-time programming than Michelle Pfeiffer's husband, David E. Kelley, right? **********Wrong. He has two rivals, two unassuming native New Yorkers who happen to live seven blocks apart on West End Avenue in Manhattan. Between them, Neal Shapiro, the executive producer of NBC's ''Dateline,'' and Victor Neufeld, the executive producer of ABC's ''20/20,'' control nine lucrative hours of prime-time programming every week. **********And while skeptics said, earlier this season, that the networks had stuffed far too many news magazines into their schedules, and that the genre would become either puffy or stale, all the magazines did reasonably well for the season, which ends this week. Their Nielsen ratings slipped, but not by as much as overall broadcast network ratings fell. **********And last week almost all were renewed for the fall -- not only five ''Dateline'' and four ''20/20'' programs, but all three CBS magazines, ''60 Minutes,'' ''60 Minutes II'' and ''48 Hours.'' Only Fox bucked the trend, and it plans to keep ''Fox Files'' in production as a potential midseason replacement show. **********News magazines held onto their prime-time slots because they are profitable -- they cost less to make than dramas or sitcoms, and they cost nothing in rights fees because the networks own them. **********With so many news magazines on the air, are they becoming fast-food operations, churning out almost interchangeable bite-sized bits of journalism each week? Or are they distinctive enough that each brings something special to the viewer? **********Talking informally, many producers and executives at the news divisions of major networks say that each news magazine has certain personality traits peculiar to itself, although there is overlap among them. Most people will not share those observations for the record, in deference to colleagues (who might, after all, become co-workers or bosses some day). **********In general, ''Dateline'' is viewed as the magazine that does best at jumping quickly on a breaking news story, producing well-reported pieces for that night's program, by correspondents who are relatively anonymous. ''Dateline,'' for example, did far more pieces on the Monica Lewinsky scandal than any of its rivals -- but ''20/20'' got the most attention on that subject, when Barbara Walters interviewed Ms. Lewinsky. **********''Dateline'' is also seen as the show that leans most heavily on ''soft,'' feature-like pieces and small-scale consumer news, as well as on weather and natural disaster stories. **********Some admire its packaging formula -- a familiar pace, each piece introduced by the anchors, Jane Pauley and Stone Phillips, the ''Timeline'' quiz in which viewers guess what year something occurred, and a closing-credits voiceover that make viewers feel they are listening in on the production staff. Others criticize the packaging as hokey. **********The distinguishing trait of ''20/20'' is its high-profile anchors, and the high-profile interviews they deliver.  But each used to star on her own night: Ms. Sawyer co-anchoring ''Prime Time Live'' on Wednesdays with Sam Donaldson; Ms. Walters ''20/20'' with Hugh Downs on Friday. This season, the two programs merged under the ''20/20'' franchise, and it was expanded to four nights a week. **********While still showcasing the big interviews and lengthy investigations on medical and consumer topics that ''20/20'' has done for almost two decades, with four nights to fill, the program is also now more likely to report on a breaking news story the same day. And if a star anchor has done a piece that because of news developments should run right away, Mr. Neufeld no longer has to wait until the night that ''belonged'' to that anchor. **********Last week, for example, ''20/20'' staff members and Ms. Sawyer did some marathon ''crashing'' -- rushing to finish ahead of schedule -- on a piece Ms. Sawyer had reported, revealing what children know about guns in their homes or neighbors'  homes. The piece had been planned for this week or next, but was finished for Friday's ''20/20'' because of the Georgia school shootings Thursday. **********Critics say that in the rush to deliver four programs a week, ''20/20'' has lost some of the polished, sophisticated look it formerly had and that the program sometimes sounds a bit overdramatic. **********CBS's ''48 Hours'' has always been different, devoting its whole hour to a single subject. Its audience, while small, is quite loyal. In the same time period as NBC's ''E.R.,'' the most popular show on television, ''48 Hours'' drew about eight million households on average this season. **********That's a far cry from its CBS sister, ''60 Minutes,'' with its average of 13.2 million homes a week. ''60 Minutes'' will finish on the Nielsen list of the top 10 prime-time programs this season -- for the 22d consecutive year. **********In personality, both ''60 Minutes'' and its spinoff, ''60 Minutes II,'' are more likely than their competitors to do complicated, arcane pieces -- which critics call dull -- and far more likely to report on subjects outside the United States. **********They differ in style, too, having four or five well-known correspondents who report individually, with no on-air interaction among them, unlike ''20/20'' and ''Dateline,'' which have larger staffs of regular correspondents, and whose co-anchors appear live and chat about the stories after each report. **********As recently as two years ago, news magazines were looked upon by network executives as useful filler -- respectable programs that could be plugged into a schedule where a sitcom or drama had failed, but unplugged as soon as something else came along. **********Now, Mr. Neufeld, Mr. Shapiro and their CBS counterparts are considered integral members of their network's prime-time programming team, directing crucial sectors of the network's strategic game plan. **********Indeed, Mr. Shapiro is invited to Burbank each spring to screen pilots of dramas and sitcoms, offer his opinions, and get an idea of what shows will lead into ''Dateline'' on the NBC schedule. **********''It's more of a courtesy,'' he said. ''A way of saying you're a player in prime time.'' **********And, these days, as big a player as such drama producers as Dick Wolf, Steven Bochco or the prolific Mr. Kelley."

Cult leaders found recruiting across provinces, collaborating with overseas groups or distributing ''a large amount'' of publications will face terms of seven years or more. Instigating a followers' suicide can result in murder charges. **********The standing committee is led by Li Peng, a former Prime Minister who played a prominent role in the crushing of the student democracy movement in 1989, and includes the most powerful and trusted members of the Parliament. On important issues it carries out the secret directives of the Communist Party. **********The announcement a week ago that the committee would be adopting a new law on cults helped set off daily silent demonstrations here by unrepentant believers. They insist that Falun Gong -- which combines slow ritual exercises with mystical theories of health and happiness -- is not a cult or a political danger. **********The crackdown has brought on a crisis with surreal aspects for the Government, which had hoped that the popular movement would dissolve after it was officially condemned as a fraud and key leaders were jailed. Instead, thousands of fervent believers, from graduate students in Beijing to retired clerks in provincial cities, have refused to repudiate a practice they regard as vital to their well-being. **********Today, for the sixth straight day, dozens of followers were detained in Tiananmen Square, next to the Great Hall of the People where the legislators met. Many came from other cities in the naive hope of convincing officials that Falun Gong is not a social threat. Instead, they were picked up as soon as they were identified by the scores of plain-clothes police roaming the vast square. **********Falun Gong members say that thousands of practitioners, most of whom faced harassment or jailing in their hometowns, have converged on Beijing, where they are now trying to elude the police dragnet. **********Officials have privately said that more than 3,000 people were detained in Beijing in the last week, most of them not in the public setting of Tiananmen Square. Many were immediately sent to their home provinces, where they may face further jailing or other punishment. **********Some local people were quickly released -- with their company managers, university department chairmen or neighborhood government offices ordered to help ''re-educate'' them. Some who were identified as organizers will be held for possible serious charges. **********By late Friday, at least 10 of the 30 Falun Gong members who took part in a clandestine news conference with foreign reporters on Thursday had been arrested, an organizer said today. **********Some of the believers who came to Beijing have described a worsening pattern of persecution in the provinces. According to a report today from a human rights monitor in Hong Kong, for example, a women's labor camp in the northeastern city of Changchun now holds 50 Falun Gong believers, including 12 schoolteachers who refused to give up the practice and who were sentenced -- without trial -- to one year in jail. **********Falun Gong, invented in 1992 by a former clerk named Li Hongzhi, combines ancient theories about cosmic forces in the body with elements of Buddhism and Taoism. His writings purport to offer a new spiritual path, and condemn drinking, smoking and homosexuality. They also suggest that believers can attain supernatural powers. **********Mr. Li moved to New York in 1998 but communicates with his devotees worldwide on the Internet. **********The Chinese Government began laying plans to destroy the group in late April, after more than 10,000 members mounted an illegal vigil around the Communist Party leadership's compound in Beijing demanding official recognition. **********China's Communist Government  charges that Falun Gong has political ambitions to subvert the state -- something Mr. Li and his followers deny."

Net income for the quarter was $477 million, or 52 cents a diluted share, compared with profit of $347 million, or 36 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $13.28 billion from $12.72 billion. **********Analysts had expected the company to earn 49 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Boeing soared $3.125 yesterday, to $43.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********''There was some decent productivity in the quarter,'' said Howard Rubel, an aerospace and military industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. **********Boeing's stock was battered last year in the wake of production problems at its flagship commercial airplane division in late 1997, which forced the company to halt production of its 747 and 737 jetliners for a month. Boeing has continued to suffer because it sold many of its jets to airlines at steep discounts while its costs soared. **********The company has since tried to streamline factory production, a process that appears to be bearing fruit. At the passenger jet division, quarterly profit was $501 million on sales of $8.5 billion, in contrast to a loss of $142 million on revenue of $7.8 billion  in the quarter a year earlier. Operating profit rose to 5.9 percent from a negative 1.8 percent in the period a year earlier. **********At the height of the crisis last year, Boeing warned that production of the 747 jumbo jet, which is the company's most profitable airplane, might fall to one a month because of the economic crisis in Asia. But the company announced yesterday what analysts and investors had assumed for months: 747 production will remain at two a month next year. **********''The strengthening Asian economy looks like it will give us a smooth landing,'' Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday during a conference call with analysts. He also predicted that demand for Boeing's passenger jets would remain flat in 2001 rather than decline from next year's projected level, as the company had previously estimated. **********Boeing raised its forecast for its full-year operating profit margins to a range of 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year from its prediction of 4.5 percent in January. Next year's profit margins are expected to be 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent, Boeing said, up from a forecast of 3.5 percent to 5 percent earlier this year. **********But Deborah Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer, said the company hoped to do better than that next year, even though Boeing's revenue is expected to decline by $11 billion as deliveries of passenger jets decline to 480 from 620. ''Our challenge is to attempt to have 2000 earnings be equal or exceed 1999,'' she said. ''That would require us to get to operating margins of about 7 percent for the total company.'' **********Some analysts worried that Boeing might be cutting too much. Research and development spending was down for the third consecutive quarter. It has fallen 28 percent in the first nine months of this year, to $1 billion from $1.4 billion in 1998. But Ms. Hopkins said that the decline was temporary and that Boeing had earmarked enough research money to finance new planes, including a larger version of the 747. **********Indeed, Boeing generated $1.1 billion in cash during the latest quarter after spending $1 billion buying 2.25 million shares of its own stock. It now has $2.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet. **********Mr. Condit said that he was not worried by recent gains by Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, which has received orders for 329 jets this year, compared with 138 for Boeing, according to Merrill Lynch. Confirming a report that Frontier Airlines was the latest airline to choose Airbus's narrow-body planes over Boeing's 737, Mr. Condit said that Boeing could not match the low price offered by Airbus and still make a profit."

Eltrax said it would be managed as two operating groups: a technology-services unit and a hospitality-services unit. Of about $130 million in expected 1999 revenue, $70 million will come from technology services and $60 million from hospitality, Eltrax said. The Atlanta-based company said a New York-based investment banker would evaluate options for increasing shareholder value, including a sale of assets or mergers. Before the announcement, Eltrax's shares fell 6.25 cents yesterday, to $3.50. At that price the company's stock market value is almost $80 million."

Although China could join the trade organization without a change in the law, the effect would be to leave China subject to different terms from the United States than it would have with the rest of the world, an outcome that would be unworkable. **********At issue is the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, legislation passed with the intent of pressuring the Soviet Union and other Communist nations to allow more emigration. The amendment allows an annual waiver if Congress and the Administration agree that it would substantially promote the law's goals. **********China has been granted a waiver each year since 1980, giving it what was long known as ''most favored nation'' status, a term changed last year to ''normal trade relations.'' **********The only other countries now denied normal trade status under the amendment are Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Vietnam and Yugoslavia, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. **********Both parties in Congress have long used the leverage of trade status to press China to improve its human rights record, curb its exports of nuclear technology, create better conditions for workers and open its markets. Anti-China sentiment in Congress has been running strong in the last few weeks because of reports that China stole nuclear secrets from the United States. **********Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican majority leader, said on Wednesday that he would oppose admitting China into the World Trade Organization. Other members of Congress are considering legislation that would require Congressional approval before Mr. Clinton could sign a deal that would clear China's admission to the trade organization. **********But there is also a sizable bipartisan bloc eager to bring China into the trading system, and it is backed by powerful interests, including exporters who want greater access to China's huge market. They want to amend or repeal the 1974 law to make China's normal trading status permanent."

An index above 50 means the number of manufacturers who said business improved was greater than the number of those who said it deteriorated. **********The Chicago purchasing managers index of new orders was unchanged at 53.2 in December, the same as in November. The production index rose to 54.9 from 51.2. The inventory index, a gauge of pent-up demand, rose to 54.8 in December from 44.4 during November.

In February, Mrs. Fox, now 69, retired when her employer, a medical billing company, relocated. To help her avoid boredom, her older son, Marty, set her up with WebTV so she could surf the Internet on her television set. That led to more frustration for Mrs. Fox, who knew little about computers and nothing about the Web. **********Her first on-line visit was to search for a new recipe for peach pie. She typed ''peaches'' into a search engine and came up with 85,870 pages. **********That was fun, at least at first. ''I felt like I had just won at bingo,'' she said. **********Her elation soon turned to disbelief, however, when she found that she had called up far more than she had bargained for, including pornographic sites involving women named Peaches. She also found sites having to do with peach wholesalers in South America. **********Then she decided to search for sites that would be of help to ''seniors.'' The search engine turned up some useful sites, but also thousands of others, many involving high school and college seniors. **********Mrs. Fox, who has a penchant for alphabetized lists, was appalled at the disorder and imprecision of the on-line world. And she suspected that she was not the only older person struggling to cope with it. ''I just knew there had to be a better way,'' she said. ''Especially for people like me who didn't know Internet from schminternet. Everything seemed such a hodgepodge.'' **********So Mrs. Fox, a widow and grandmother, decided to take action. With the help of the son who had given her the WebTV and  works in the technology field, she started her own site (www.grandmabetty.com) for people over 50. It went on line in September 1998 and contains original material plus hundred of links to other sites, all selected by Mrs. Fox based on what she thinks are its visitors' interests. **********To be sure, there are many commercial, nonprofit and Governmental Web sites for older people, run by entities as diverse as AARP (www.aarp.org) and Microsoft (www.microsoft.com/seniors). But for scope, ease of use and relevance, few sites can match grandmabetty.com. Not to mention orderliness and precision. The site can send you directly to the pie recipes, without the pornography. **********The home page displays a photograph of her holding her grandson, David, when he was a baby. Above it is a list of areas on the site, including ''Ask Grandma,'' where people can send her E-mail. Another, called Sponsors, invites ads for the site, but Mrs. Fox has since decided that she will not accept advertising; she wants her site -- essentially her hobby -- to be objective, although, of course, many links contain ads. She says she has turned down advertising for products like vitamins and promotions for sites selling Viagra. **********Most of the site's categories offer very good lists of links. Under investing, there are links to scores of sites, from American Express to Ziegler Thrift Trading, an on-line brokerage firm. **********Other categories include entertainment, government, health, travel, magazines, memorabilia, news and weather. There's even a way to find winning lottery numbers in the various states. ''Government'' will take you from the Administration on Aging all the way to the White House. **********Fred B. Chernow, 67, a retired school principal and author of ''The Sharper Mind'' (Prentice-Hall), a book about memory improvement, found the site while exploring the Web and likes it because it address common problems. ''There are always suggestions for things to do,'' said Mr. Chernow, who lives in Westbury, N.Y. ''It's a great antidote for loneliness.'' **********Mrs. Fox says her site has about 150 visitors a day, a small number compared with many popular sites but a sign of the Web's reach. She gets about 30 E-mail messages a day and answers them all, but she won't give legal, medical or financial advice. **********She still manages grandmabetty.com from her Queens apartment, using her WebTV device, and would like to expand the site to include features like chat rooms. ''But right now, I'm keeping it at a level I'm comfortable with,'' she said. ''It's a starting point for seniors who want to go on line.''"

In the anxious early days of 1948, with Czechoslovakia slipping under Communist sway and Berlin blockaded, he feared that the Soviet Union would pick off the nations of Western Europe one by one. **********Mr. Bevin therefore proposed to the British Cabinet on Jan. 8 ''that we should seek to form with the backing of the Americas and the dominions a Western democratic system comprising Scandinavia, the Low Countries, France, Italy, Greece and possibly Portugal. As soon as circumstances permit, we should, of course, wish to include Spain and Germany, without whom no Western system can be complete.'' **********With minor changes, that idea became NATO, the centerpiece of the allied containment policy. **********''It was superb idea, and it turned out to be a superb accomplishment,'' said Lucius D. Battle, now 80, an American diplomat who was present when the treaty establishing the organization was signed on April 4, 1949. ''Surprising, in a way. It was not at all clear, and there was by no means universal agreement, that it was the right way to go.'' **********After some initial hesitation, the far-seeing American Secretary of State George C. Marshall, who had served as the nation's military Chief of Staff during World War II, and his discreet, patrician Under Secretary, Robert A. Lovett, came to agree with Mr. Bevin. (At one early stage, Mr. Lovett accused the British of ''asking us to pour concrete before we see the blueprints.'') They oversaw months of negotiations that produced a draft treaty by Christmastime. **********Mr. Marshall's successor, Dean G. Acheson, pushed the talks to a conclusion in 1949 and won Senate approval with the help of Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, a Republican and former isolationist. **********But the real American midwife of the new organization, the first major military alliance the United States had ever joined in peacetime, was a career diplomat named John D. Hickerson. Unknown then and all but forgotten now, Mr. Hickerson, a wry, 50-year-old Texan who had worked his way through the University of Texas at Austin, in part by shining shoes, championed the concept. **********Ultimately he persuaded Mr. Marshall, and through him, President Harry S. Truman, of the importance of the principle that became Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty: An armed attack on any of the signing countries would be considered an attack on all. **********That, he believed, would provide the tight links between Europe, the United States and Canada that Mr. Bevin sought. For most of the rest of 1948, while President Truman was staging the whirlwind campaign that produced his upset victory in November, Mr. Hickerson and his No. 2 in the State Department's Bureau of European Affairs, Theodore C. Achilles, labored in the shadows with Hume Wrong of Canada and senior European diplomats to pound a treaty into shape. **********''They were the valiant workers in the vineyards,'' said George Elsey, now 81, then an aide to Truman.  ''They were the ones who put things together.'' **********That it could be done at all was remarkable. It is an iron rule of American politics that lame-duck Presidents take few initiatives. Those they do take almost always misfire. Truman, seen as a sure loser to Thomas E. Dewey, not only laid the groundwork for NATO but also instituted the Marshall Plan. **********But those were extraordinary times. The Allies were keeping Berlin alive only with an airlift of unprecedented dimensions. On March 10, 1948, the body of Jan Masaryk, the Czech Foreign Minister, was found on the pavement outside his apartment; it was never established whether he had been killed by the Communists or had committed suicide in political despair. In Asia, Gen. Douglas MacArthur was warning that the imminent victory of Chinese forces ''imperiled'' the United States. And in Washington, the Red Scare was under way; on Dec. 15, Alger Hiss was indicted for perjury. **********Times were hard in Europe. The Washington lawyer Lloyd N. Cutler, then a junior Government official, recalls staying at the grand Claridge hotel in London and shivering because there was no heat. According to his biographer, Alan Bullock, Mr. Bevin was horrified that spring when a French minister told him the Russians would be in Paris by August. **********In the United States, the mood was grave but not frantic. ''We took the cold war seriously,'' Mr. Elsey said, ''but I would not say there was a sense of crisis -- nothing remotely resembling the feeling later, during the Cuban missile crisis. Like the Marshall Plan, NATO was carefully crafted, by people who didn't let the alarm bells distract them.'' **********Not that everyone agreed that NATO was the right solution. George F. Kennan, then the director of policy planning at the State Department, favored the containment of the Soviet Union. But he saw the problem as basically political, and he warned that the proposed pact ''would amount to a final militarization of the present dividing-line through Europe'' (which, in the event, it did). **********Paul Nitze, who was to be his successor, said last week that NATO ''seemed to me at the time an overcommitment on our part.'' When the Russians soon after announced that they had developed an atomic bomb, ''I took a much more radical line,'' Mr. Nitze, now 92, recalled. ''I thought getting rid of our nuclear weapons, unilaterally if necessary, was the best way to go.'' **********The leading American journalist of the day, Walter Lippmann, wanted to neutralize a united Germany, rather than try to ally with the western part of a divided Germany. He argued that Germans would ''never align themselves honestly and reliably with one side or the other,'' and he dismissed NATO as ''inflationary paper from the mimeograph machine in the State Department.'' **********But significant as those voices were, the State Department's European desk -- Mr. Hickerson and Mr. Achilles -- ''carried the day,'' said James Chace in his biography, ''Acheson'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998). **********The founding members were the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Iceland, Norway and Denmark. **********In April, the treaty was signed in the Departmental Auditorium building, since renamed the Andrew Mellon Auditorium, on Constitution Avenue. Mr. Acheson signed for the United States, Truman at his side. The Marine Band played airs from ''Porgy and Bees,'' rather disconcertingly including ''It Ain't Necessarily So'' and ''I Got Plenty of Nothin'.'' **********''Who in the world picked the music?'' Mr. Acheson asked. **********The ratification debate was not plenty of nothin'. Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the unofficial leader of the Senate Republicans, opposed the treaty, largely because it would commit the United States to fight alongside any attacked member, robbing Congress of its Constitutional authority to declare war. That, of course, was just what the Europeans wanted. **********Mr. Acheson's negotiations, as he wrote in his memoir, ''Present at the Creation'' (W. W. Norton, 1987), ''became a contest between our allies, seeking to impale the Senate on the specific, and the senators, attempting to wriggle free.'' With Mr. Vandenberg's help, he convinced both groups, and the treaty was resoundingly approved by the Senate, 82 votes to 13, on July 21."

Canada became a Council member in January for a two-year term. **********Russia, which wants to lift the oil embargo imposed on Iraq in 1990 and abolish the current arms inspection system, has reacted coolly to the Canadian plan, saying it does not give a prominent role to Secretary General Kofi Annan, diplomats said. **********The United States, which is prepared to allow Iraq to sell more oil to buy civilian goods without limits but wants to keep arms inspections in place, is listening to Canada's ideas with interest, diplomats said. **********France has also made a proposal to the Council, recommending the end to the oil embargo but controls over Iraqi spending once oil sales resume and continued arms monitoring. **********Iraq basically wants no restrictions of any kind, saying it has already disarmed completely and is not a threat to its neighbors, an assertion independent arms control experts do not believe. **********The Canadians say the Russian and French proposals leave open important questions about how an arms embargo would be enforced if sanctions were lifted, and how monitoring can be restored to Iraq, which now wants no part of arms inspections. **********Canada, with the support of Brazil, this month's Council president, is calling for comprehensive assessments on the status of Iraqi disarmament and on the humanitarian situation in Iraq. **********These assessments would then be the basis for a Council debate about what was needed next, and what would be acceptable to Iraq's supporters here as well as to President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. **********The arms report would be compiled by experts from the United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Both have been out of Iraq since the American and British air strikes in mid-December. **********The Canadians are suggesting that Jayantha Dhanapala, Under Secretary General for Disarmament Affairs, preside over the expert meetings on disarmament, a proposal that would sideline Richard Butler, who is the executive chairman of the Special Commission and whom the Russians essentially do not want to deal with. **********Under the Canadian plan, Sergio Vieira de Mello, Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, would be chairman of a group of experts on the civilian programs and the workings of the Iraqi sanctions committee."

Immigration laws prohibited the parents from bringing all four of their children, so the 9-year-old Ms. Lin and her younger sister stayed behind with a family friend. **********Ms. Lin is now 28 and runs a small trading company in Shenzhen, just across the mainland border from Hong Kong. But she has never abandoned her dream to rejoin her parents. In the wake of a landmark immigration ruling here, Ms. Lin believes she may never have a better chance. **********Last month, a Hong Kong court ruled that children born of parents who are Hong Kong residents have the right to live in the territory. The decision opens the door to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of mainlanders. But officials in Beijing have said the ruling violates China's constitution and must be ''rectified.'' **********For the last two weeks, Ms. Lin and 300 other mainland Chinese camped out on a concrete plaza in front of the government offices here. She and the others with her are so determined to stay in Hong Kong that they defied orders to leave -- even avoiding trips to the toilet for fear of being nabbed by immigration officers. **********Today the protesters disbanded the sit-in after the Hong Kong immigration department indicated that it would allow them to stay for now. But to win permanent residency, they may have to return to mainland China, a prospect which leaves Ms. Lin in despair. **********''I have nobody left in China,'' said Ms. Lin, explaining that even her younger sister has since been allowed to migrate to Hong Kong. ''Even in Shenzhen, I might as well live in a hotel.'' **********Ragtag but resolute, these protesters are pawns in a potentially momentous legal dispute between Hong Kong and China. What is at issue is whether Hong Kong's courts have the right to make their own laws -- even if that means striking down mainland Chinese laws that conflict with Hong Kong's statutes. **********Ms. Lin did not wait for the legal issues to be thrashed out. She and hundreds of mainland residents poured into Hong Kong on temporary visas to assert their claim to residency. When the Hong Kong authorities told them to return to mainland China to file formal applications, they refused. ''It's really tough for us,'' Ms. Lin said. ''The Chinese Government has said that if we go back to China, we might be punished.'' **********So far, Hong Kong has treated the protesters with uncommon forbearance. It has let them build a squatters' camp inside the gates of the government offices, just steps from where the chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, alights from his limousine. That, more than any legal decision, may explain why these people are so ready to forsake mainland China for this former British colony. **********''Hong Kong is much better than China because of the life style and because you are allowed freedom of expression,'' said a 40-year-old woman from nearby Guangdong province whose husband lives in Hong Kong. The woman, who identified herself as Mrs. Siu, is trying to gain residency for their 16-year-old daughter. When Chinese authorities declined the girl's application, Mrs. Siu paid to have her smuggled across the border by a ''snakehead,'' the name given to shadowy gang members who traffic in illegal migrants. **********On Saturday, the Hong Kong government reiterated a warning that it would deport mainlanders who are here illegally. But it has signaled that it will allow the protesters to stay -- at least until a local court rules on their residency claims. Last week, a court blocked the deportation of 17 mainland Chinese who entered Hong Kong illegally but contend they have the right to live here. **********The larger question -- whether the Court of Final Appeal ruling will be reversed by Beijing -- may not be answered until next month, when the National People's Congress of China holds its annual meeting. Some legal experts predict that China will allow the decision on residency to stand, while watering down the Hong Kong court's sweeping assertion of judicial independence. **********Still, tolerance of the migrants does not equal acceptance. The prospect of hordes of people streaming into the territory has stirred deeply ambivalent feelings among native Hong Kongers. Although many people here are refugees from China, they fear that a new influx will strain Hong Kong's resources and swell the ranks of the unemployed during an already grinding recession. **********Albert Cheng, a popular talk-radio host, said that the day after the court ruling was announced, 90 percent of his callers opposed it. On the issue of whether to welcome or spurn the migrants, Hong Kong people can seem more colonial than their former British rulers. ''People have all these stereotypes about how mainlanders will reduce the quality of life in Hong Kong,'' Mr. Cheng said. ''They don't line up for buses, they throw garbage all over the place.'' **********Such stereotypes sting the people who squatted in front of the chief executive's office here. **********''It's very unfair because people who have had no education don't know how to live differently,'' said Mrs. Siu, brushing away angry tears as she recounted her family's struggle to set down roots in Hong Kong. **********Mrs. Siu's husband migrated to Hong Kong in the 1970's with no education. He held menial jobs and returned to China in 1981 to find a wife. When Mrs. Siu and her husband had a daughter, immigration laws barred them from bringing her to Hong Kong. Mrs. Siu stayed with the girl in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, while her husband returned to Hong Kong. **********Mrs. Siu wants her daughter to be educated here so that she can live like any other descendant of Chinese people in China's newest city. **********''Whether a man's wife is from Hong Kong or China,'' she declared, in words that could have been torn from the court ruling, ''his descendants are people of Hong Kong, and they can't be discriminated against.''"

Workers To Relax Effort,Job Fears Push I.R.S. Workers To Relax Effort," **********Internal Revenue Service tax collectors, under intense pressure from Congress to be nicer to taxpayers, have drastically scaled back efforts to collect unpaid taxes, newly available statistics show. **********Seizures of property are down 98 percent over the last two years, according to the I.R.S. Levies and garnishments of bank accounts and paychecks are just one-fourth the level of two years ago. And filings of tax liens, which make sure that back taxes are paid when a property is sold, are down two-thirds. **********Part of the drop-off in enforcement is because the I.R.S. has been shifting some resources to pay for customer service, new computers and retraining. But I.R.S. officers in six states said in interviews that the biggest reason for the retreat was their fear of being dismissed for running afoul of a new law intended to protect taxpayers from overzealous collectors. **********Workers' fears prompted Charles O. Rossotti, the Tax Commissioner, to send a memo with the March paychecks for the I.R.S.'s 98,000 employees assuring them that their jobs were safe unless they willfully abused taxpayers' rights. **********On May 5, Mr. Rossotti issued regulations aimed at carrying out the new law. **********''We are concerned about it,'' Mr. Rossotti said yesterday about the reluctance of many tax collectors to undertake enforcement actions. The Government has not tallied the lost revenue, but based on historic rates it expected to collect about $30 billion this year from enforcement actions such as issuing liens, filing levies and seizing property. **********Tax experts who have worried that Congress overreacted to complaints about the I.R.S. said that the collapse of collection efforts would lead to widespread tax evasion if some balance was not quickly restored to the political climate surrounding the agency. **********''It's a dumb law,'' said one critic, Donald C. Alexander, the Nixon Administration Tax Commissioner. Mr. Alexander, now a Washington tax lawyer, said the fall-off in collections was causing alarm among I.R.S. executives. **********''When someone can fail to meet his or her tax obligations without a worry about having enforcement actions taken, then other creditors are going to come in first and get paid, and the deadbeat taxpayer wins,'' he said. **********A spokeswoman for William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee was a principal sponsor of the new law, said he saw no problems with its requirements. **********''Clearly the Senator's intention was not to either frighten good I.R.S. employees or encourage tax evasion,'' said the spokeswoman, Ginny Flynn. ''His intention was to insure that I.R.S. employees do not treat either their colleagues or taxpayers unfairly and to insure that the Tax Commissioner can deal with them.'' **********The new law, the I.R.S. Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, states that agency employees must be dismissed if, following an administrative inquiry, they are found to have committed any of 10 acts, among them violating a taxpayer's constitutional or civil rights, threatening an audit for personal gain, making a false statement under oath or falsifying or destroying documents to conceal mistakes. Employees terminated under the law have no right to appeal. **********Mr. Rossotti, who ran a successful computer consulting firm before joining the Government late in 1997, gently suggested that I.R.S. employees were overreacting to the law. **********''I don't want to denigrate the fears and concerns of front-line employees,'' he said last week, ''but the reality is that this law deals with willful and serious misconduct.'' **********Yet the carrying out of the law -- and the sharp decline in collections -- come amid a cultural revolution at the I.R.S. that has many longtime employees struggling to shift from an adversarial approach to a new customer-service mindset. **********Many longtime auditors have chafed, for example, at being pulled off examining tax returns to answer telephone calls from taxpayers. Other employees say that Mr. Rossotti is naive and fails to realize how many taxpayers chisel and cheat, requiring costly collection efforts. **********The result, current and former I.R.S. officials said, is near-paralysis in the agency's enforcement apparatus. **********Margaret Richardson, the Clinton Administration's first Tax Commissioner, said ''there is a lot of healthy skepticism'' among tax collectors about Mr. Rossotti's promise that only willful acts will result in dismissals. **********No I.R.S. employees have yet been disciplined under the law, but as of the end of March, about 240 formal investigations were under way by an inspector general's office set up within the Treasury Department under the new law, officials said. **********''If I were a revenue officer today I would have great hesitance to take any enforcement action,'' Mr. Alexander said. **********Congress, meanwhile, has frozen the I.R.S. budget just when Mr. Rossotti is seeking billions of dollars to build new computer systems, retrain the agency's staff and recruit new managers from outside the Government. Some of the money to finance these moves has come from scaling back audits and collection efforts, officials acknowledge. **********In the six months ended March 31, the I.R.S. seized property to satisfy long-overdue taxes 108 times, down from 1,150 seizures in the comparable period a year earlier and 5,000 seizures two years ago. **********Garnishments of paychecks and levies of bank accounts in the latest six months fell to 458,000, down from 1.8 million two years earlier. Liens, which insure that taxes are paid when property is sold, fell to 98,000, compared with 272,000 two years ago. **********Both I.R.S. executives and leaders of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents agency workers, agree that the slowdown in collections represents the individual actions of tax collectors and not a job action by the union, which would be prohibited by Federal law. **********Thirteen tax collectors interviewed around the country over the last week described easing up on scofflaw taxpayers they would have aggressively pursued before the new law took effect. **********''With this new law, if somebody says 'I'm not paying,' then we just say 'thank you' and leave,'' said a tax collector in San Francisco who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation by supervisors. **********Business owners who are habitually late turning over taxes withheld from workers' paychecks also have begun using the law to derail collection of overdue taxes, said Phyllis Vidler, president of the National Treasury Employees Union local in Detroit, which represents I.R.S. workers in Michigan. **********A collection officer in Washington State who also feared retaliation if quoted by name said, ''If you don't want to pay your taxes today all you have to do is say two magic words: installment agreement. **********''You just say you want one,'' the officer explained, ''and even if the terms you propose are ridiculous -- like $10 a week when you owe tens of thousands -- collection stops while your proposal goes up and down the chain of managers, until 90 days later you are told no. **********''Then you just need to say another magic word -- harassment -- and because of this new law, the collection process stops while your complaint gets reviewed.'' **********Mr. Rossotti, the Tax Commissioner, said the new law ''did create a lot of concern and anxiety among many employees, understandably, because it affects every one of them and some of the provisions are rather complex.'' **********He said that in addition to his March memo, he was trying to instill in I.R.S. managers ''the difference between accidental versus intentional mistakes.'' **********Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, noted that the provisions of the new law relating to agency employees' conduct were not among those recommended by a Congressional commission on reforming the I.R.S. Mr. Kerrey was a co-chairman of those hearings. **********''We need to change at least 4 or 5 of the 10 items in this law, or reform just isn't going to work,'' Senator Kerrey said, ''because it creates a disincentive for I.R.S. people to do their jobs.'' **********One longtime tax collector in Manhattan said he and others were troubled that the new law mandated dismissals for several acts even if willful misconduct was not proved -- including violations of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 or ''falsifying or destroying documents to conceal mistakes.'' **********''You say 'intentional,' I say honest mistake,'' this tax collector said. ''I'm not going to risk my job on that, and I don't believe anyone else would either.'' **********I.R.S. agents and officials of their union point to the case of a revenue officer in White Plains. The woman, they say, is under investigation by the inspector general for purportedly covering up a mistake, in this case for violating the new law because her activity log failed to note whether she had included a particular form in a delinquency notice she sent to a taxpayer. The notice was returned by the Postal Service as undeliverable because the taxpayer had moved, said Frank Heffler, president of the local union. **********''Nothing happened here but a simple mistake of no consequence, but now there are two inspectors working on this, and the revenue officer fears she will lose her job,'' he said. ''Given the trouble you can get into over a work log, I don't know anyone who would execute a property seizure and risk their job.'' **********Mrs. Richardson, who was Mr. Rossotti's predecessor as tax commissioner, said tax collectors were responding to his signals. **********''The big message is in the new I.R.S. mission statement, which says nothing about collecting taxes,'' she said. ''That was a powerful message to the organization, to people who don't want to pay and to unscrupulous tax professionals.'' **********The new mission statement, written by Mr. Rossotti, says that the I.R.S. should ''provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.'' **********Montie Day, a former I.R.S. criminal investigator and Federal prosecutor who now regularly sues the I.R.S. on behalf of taxpayers, said that Mr. Rossotti should take forceful action to restore collections. **********''Basically there is no enforcement going on right now, and that undermines the whole tax system,'' he said. ''And as word about this gets out two things will happen: People who are inclined to cheat will say to themselves that since they aren't going to be made to pay up, they should cheat and people who are inclined to pay as the law requires will ask themselves, 'Why am I doing this?'

Some Office Workers Say It's the Paper,BUSINESS; Sick of Paperwork? Some Office Workers Say It's the Paper," **********CARBONLESS copy paper is everywhere. Write something on the top sheet, and it is replicated on the sheets below, usually in a medium blue hue, without fuss or mess. Handle the stuff now and then, as most people do, and it is a great convenience. But handle it constantly and, some people say, it will make you sick. **********The paper, also known as N.C.R. paper (for ''no carbon required''), is coated on one side with microscopic capsules. Pressure from a pen or dot-matrix printer bursts some of the capsules, releasing chemicals that react with others on the sheet below to make a visible dye. The complex formula varies from brand to brand, but among the dozens of chemicals used are some, like formaldehyde, odorless kerosene and various organic solvents, that can be hazardous in sufficient quantity. **********Health concerns about heavy exposure to carbonless copy paper, or more precisely, the chemicals it emits, are not new: the Government first studied the issue in the 1980's but found the available data to be inconclusive. But after an accumulation of further research and complaints by workers, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health reopened its inquiry and has drafted a report for publication later this fall that may lead to a new requirement for warning labels on packages of carbonless paper. Workers who say they have been harmed opened a new legal front earlier this month by filing a class-action suit in California on novel legal grounds. **********Though manufacturers have occasionally offered settlements to individual workers who have sued them contending injury, they maintain that carbonless paper is safe, that the chemical exposure from using it is trivial and that no one has yet demonstrated a definite link between the product and any illness. According to Pulp and Paper Weekly, a trade publication, American paper mills shipped more than 700,000 tons of carbonless paper last year, and it is likely that nearly every American adult has come into contact with it at one time or another. **********Of course, most people do not handle quite as much of it as Brenda Smith did at work. She spent 25 years as an operator and customer service representative for Bell Atlantic and its Bell System predecessors in Virginia Beach, Va. ''I like helping people,'' she said in a recent telephone interview, ''and people always told me I sound real nice over the phone.'' For the last 10 of those years, much of her daily paperwork involved forms printed on carbonless copy paper, sometimes a hundred or more a day. ''It was all around us,'' she said, ''on our desks, in the supply closets and in the file cabinets.'' **********Like a flu that sneaks up on you, Ms. Smith said, illnesses gradually came to plague her. ''I suffered from chronic headaches, bronchitis and laryngitis,'' she recalled. By 1992, when she was in her early 40's, she could no longer do her job and was dismissed. **********At the time, she said, she had no idea what was causing the deterioration in her health, but she now believes she was acquiring a condition called multiple chemical sensitivity from her years of heavy exposure to  carbonless paper. Now 51, Ms. Smith said she suffers constant fatigue and sinus infections and gets by on Social Security disability payments. **********And she has become an activist, seeking out others who also believe that they have been made ill by carbonless paper. One she found had a job that was very similar to hers.  Patricia Kozlowski, 51, worked for Bell Atlantic in Annapolis, Md., for 23 years as a customer service representative. She said she suffered reddened and swollen eyes, vertigo and migraine headaches during the late 1980's and early 1990's, and after an extended leave from her job, was let go in 1995. Another is Sharon Mac Laughlin, a former county welfare examiner in Ithaca, N.Y., who reports multiple chemical sensitivity symptoms similar to Ms. Smith's. **********The three women began working together six years ago to raise awareness of health issues surrounding heavy exposure to carbonless paper, and in March formed a group called the Carbonless Copy Paper Injury and Information Network, with a Web site devoted to news and research reports about the issue, www.carbonless.org. **********Its main goal is to force manufacturers to put warning labels on their products. ''All we want is for people who use carbonless copy forms to be aware of the health risks,'' Ms. Smith said. ''It's not our intention to scare people. Obviously not everyone will have problems. But heavy users should be warned.'' **********In part because of their activities, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 1997 reopened an inquiry that had lain dormant for a decade. ''In 1987, we came to a conclusion that we couldn't come to a conclusion,'' said Paul Schulte, director of education and information at the institute, who is overseeing the current investigation of carbonless paper. ''The data wasn't clear, so we put it aside. In the ensuing 10 years, the scientific literature kept growing and so did the number of individuals who alleged health effects.'' **********The institute's new report is being reviewed by other Government agencies, academic researchers and manufacturers of the paper. Mr. Schulte would not discuss the report's detailed findings in advance of its publication, but said in general that the effort was complicated by the difficulty in predicting adverse reactions like skin and eye irritation that have been attributed to the paper. ''It depends on use patterns, environmental conditions and genetic characteristics,'' he said, as well as chemical exposure. **********Perhaps the biggest problem for scientists and regulators is that carbonless copy paper is not an easy-to-define product. The processes and chemicals involved in its manufacture are proprietary and closely guarded by the competing manufacturers. (The leaders are Appleton Paper, Mead and Moore.) The exact chemical composition varies greatly from sheet to sheet, form to form and manufacturer to manufacturer, according to Charles Schmidt, who until recently was a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Florida in Gainesville and who has reviewed the national institute's report. ''Most of the information concerning composition and production is described in patents rather than more readily available scientific literature,'' he said. **********Laboratory research by Professor Schmidt and colleagues at the university found that a class of chemicals called alkyl biphenols used in carbonless paper can be transferred  to human skin, and that odorless-kerosene fumes are a primary component of the gases that can be detected evaporating from the paper even before it is used. **********Manufacturers say their own research has found no cause for concern at any level, and they object to the idea of warning labels. ''Carbonless copy paper has not been associated with any health risks, so no need exists to make health warnings,'' said Bill Van Den Brandt, a spokesman for Appleton Paper in Appleton, Wis., which produces more than 500,000 tons annually, making it the leading manufacturer. Amber Garwood, a spokeswoman for Meade, which made 216,000 tons last year, said her company is also convinced that its product is safe to handle. **********NONETHELESS, the institute's soon-to-be-published report is likely to conclude that some level of risk exists. ''The major message is that it can be irritating to some people,'' said Dr. Robert McCunney, president of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, who has reviewed the report. ''Carbonless copy paper has the potential to cause skin and mucous-membrane -- eye, nose and throat -- irritation.'' **********The national institute has compiled a long list of symptoms that have been reported in connection with heavy exposure to the paper, but so far it has not assessed just how many people may be at risk or who they are; instead, the institute has examined factors like the volume of paper used, room temperature, ventilation rates in work and storage areas and general work practices as possible contributing factors. Some experts believe that it may be impossible to establish a direct link between exposure to the paper's chemicals and serious medical conditions like Ms. Smith's. **********One issue that the report may help resolve is a semantic one, but with important regulatory consequences: whether carbonless copy paper should continue to be classified as an ''article,'' like a stapler or a file cabinet, or whether it more properly belongs under the heading of a ''chemical substance.'' The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires warning labels on packaging and detailed fact sheets made available to employees about chemical substances in the workplace, but not for articles. Sharon Snyder, a spokeswoman for O.S.H.A., said the agency was looking into the classification issue. **********A class action lawsuit, filed by Ms. Smith's group on Sept. 2 in California, contends that carbonless copy paper falls afoul not of Federal regulations but of that state's Proposition 65. That right-to-know law, adopted in 1986, requires companies to give a ''clear and reasonable'' warning before knowingly exposing anyone to carcinogens or other hazardous chemicals on a state-published list. The suit, which names 12 paper manufacturers as defendants, asserts that at least three chemicals on the state's list -- formaldehyde, benzene and toluene diisocyanate -- are used in carbonless paper."

After suffering declines during the recession of the early 1990's, Mercedes-Benz has bounced back, setting a sales record in 1998. Among Lowe's contributions has been the creation of award-winning campaigns that included an acclaimed commercial featuring the Marlene Dietrich recording of ''Falling in Love Again.'' **********But it seems that the client and agency may be falling out of love after a meeting that took place on Wednesday between top executives of Mercedes-Benz, a unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G., and Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The meeting was disclosed yesterday in response to inquiries by a reporter checking a tip that Mercedes-Benz had dismissed Lowe, which has handled the account since November 1993. **********''We have not dismissed the agency,'' said Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz in Montvale, N.J. **********Rather, she added, Michael Jackson, president and chief executive, and Joe Eberhardt, vice president for marketing, met with Lowe executives on Wednesday to ''discuss the seriousness of the situation and express concern about two issues.'' **********''We opened the door to these discussions yesterday,'' Ms. Boland said, ''and there will be further discussions with Lowe next week. **********''At that point in time, we probably will have something to tell you one way or the other.'' **********Lee Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer at Lowe, confirmed yesterday that a meeting took place at the agency on Wednesday with the Mercedes-Benz executives, but he declined to discuss details. **********One issue brought up at the Wednesday meeting, Ms. Boland said, was ''whether there is a conflict with the Interpublic global alliance with General Motors after the creation of DaimlerChrysler.'' Her reference was to the fact that agencies like Ammirati Puris Lintas, Campbell-Ewald and McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising -- which like Lowe are owned by Interpublic -- handle G.M. brands like GMC trucks, Chevrolet and Buick. **********The General Motors Corporation is of course a longtime competitor of the Chrysler Corporation, which merged with Daimler-Benz A.G. last year to form DaimlerChrysler. Chrysler agencies include the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group and the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North Communications. **********The other issue discussed at the Wednesday meeting, Ms. Boland said, was ''the current management situation at Lowe,'' including ''attrition'' -- a reference to the abrupt departure last month of Robert A. Kantor, president for United States operations -- and ''the absence of Marvin, certainly.'' **********That reference was to Marvin Sloves, who retired on Dec. 31 as co-chairman of Lowe after serving in that post for four years and as a vice chairman for a year before that. Mr. Sloves retired with the expiration of a two-year extension of what had been a three-year contract. **********''The bottom line,'' Ms. Boland said, ''is we are concerned about the current management situation'' at Lowe. **********Speculation about the state of relations between Mercedes-Benz and Lowe intensified with the retirement of Mr. Sloves because he had been particularly close to executives at Mercedes-Benz since his previous agency, Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, landed the auto marketer's account in 1992. The account came to Lowe along with Mr. Sloves when Scali, McCabe was acquired and merged into Lowe in 1993. **********There has also been speculation in trade publications like The Delaney Report that Mr. Sloves, a hale man who still relishes the business, had sought to stay on beyond Dec. 31. Asked about that in an interview on Dec. 8, Mr. Sloves replied: ''No, no, no, I never really thought about it. It was the end of my contract.'' **********Mr. Garfinkel and Mr. Sloves had been co-chairmen at Lowe; with Mr. Sloves's retirement, Mr. Garfinkel became the sole chairman. **********Mr. Garfinkel concurred with Ms. Boland about the subjects discussed at the meeting. One was ''potential conflicts'' related to G.M. and Interpublic, he said, and the other was what he called ''management issues at the agency that existed in 1998.'' **********In articles that appeared on Jan. 25, the advertising trade publications Frohlinger's Marketing Report and Adweek reported that Mr. Sloves was discussing with executives at other agencies joining them and bringing the Mercedes-Benz account with him. **********''My understanding is that Marvin is not out there on our behalf,'' Ms. Boland said, adding: ''We do not have a contract with him. Our contract is with the agency.'' **********Among the agencies mentioned by Frohlinger's as possible new homes for the Mercedes-Benz account was BBDO New York, a unit of BBDO Worldwide. The trade publication Advertising Age reported this week that Pentacom in Troy, Mich., a unit of BBDO Worldwide, had been named to handle media services for Mercedes-Benz in North America on an interim basis as DaimlerChrysler examines a permanent realignment of media duties after the merger. **********Another possible new home for the account cited by Frohlinger's was Foote, Cone & Belding Worldwide, another True North agency. **********Asked on Dec. 8 whether the Mercedes-Benz links with Lowe were jeopardized because of his retirement, Mr. Sloves demurred. **********''I don't think it's here because of me,'' he said then. **********But now the account, with billings that represent up to 20 percent of Lowe's total of $750 million, may be departing. **********The turmoil on the account comes despite the fact that Mercedes-Benz sold a record number of vehicles in the United States in 1998. Sales of cars and sport utility vehicles totaled 213,379, up 55.9 percent from 1997; car sales climbed 39.2 percent, and its sport utility vehicle sales rose 196.1 percent. **********Last month, car sales increased 6 percent from January 1998, while factory capacity kept sales of sport utility vehicles even with the month a year earlier."

Zeien, said yesterday that he would retire on April 15, after a year of mixed financial results. **********Mr. Zeien led Gillette, the world's largest maker of men's shaving systems, for eight years and was the force behind the Mach 3, Gillette's new three-blade shaver. He will be replaced by Michael C. Hawley, the company's president and chief operating officer. **********The company said that Mr. Zeien's decision to step down was his alone. And while analysts said they thought that Mr. Zeien, who is 68, initiated the management change, his departure comes at a time when Gillette, hurt by financial instability in some international markets, has been struggling to consistently deliver its goal of double-digit earnings growth. **********Gillette has long prided itself not only on the strength of its Sensor line of razors and blades but also on its global reach and consistent delivery of double-digit quarterly earnings growth. Both were factors that hurt the company last year. **********Just as it was promoting the Mach 3 and rolling it out as fast as its factories would produce them, Gillette, which gets about 35 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, was suffering from weakness in many international markets, slow battery sales of its Duracell brand, and reduced revenues from blades. **********Largely because of the troubles abroad, particularly in emerging markets, Gillette's profits fell nearly 20 percent in the third quarter of last year -- the company's first quarterly decline in eight years. **********The company, however, did rebound somewhat in the fourth quarter, when it posted a 5 percent gain in operating income, to $720 million. Since then, management has said, and reiterated in a conference call yesterday, that it expects to return to a 15 percent to 20 percent rate of earnings growth in the second half of this year. **********''You'll lose no sleep over investments in Gillette over the next few years,'' said Mr. Zeien, who is a 31-year veteran of the Boston-based company. He said that although there was never an ideal time to step aside, ''this is almost the best time.'' In support of that view, he ticked off a number of achievements, including the introduction of the Mach 3 seven months ago, the company's acquisition of Duracell and its having overcome what he called a ''blip'' in the third quarter. **********Mr. Hawley, who will take over after the company's annual meeting on April 15, said that going forward, ''we will capitalize on the sales and profits growth opportunities to be realized, and the cost reduction benefits to be derived, from two key activities we've recently begun.'' They are an integration of the company's global operations in 1997 and a reorganization announced last year. **********Mr. Hawley, 61, has worked for Gillette in various capacities for 31 years, including in finance, marketing and technical operations. He is considered one of Gillette's most experienced international managers, having worked in five countries. **********Under his leadership, Mr. Hawley said, investors can be assured that Gillette will remain focused on being the leader ''in existing or new core product categories in which we choose to compete.'' **********As for Mr. Zeien, said Wendy Nicholson, an analyst who follows Gillette for Salomon Smith Barney, ''given Gillette's weakness in 1998, I think Al probably felt very personally compelled to stay with the company to ride them through this difficult time.'' **********''Now that they have reported better earnings in the fourth quarter and the momentum seems to have been restored at the company, Al can leave Gillette feeling like he left a healthy business,'' Ms. Nicholson said. ''Clearly, given the historical success, he would not have left the company on a down tick.'' **********Gillette announced the management change after the market closed. Its shares closed at $55.6875, down 81.25 cents."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/world/quake-moves-europe-and-turkey-closer.html,Stephen Kinzer,1999-08-29,รฏ,927,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Quake Moves Europe and Turkey Closer,Quake Moves Europe and Turkey Closer," **********When seismologists reviewed data from last week's devastating earthquake in Turkey, they made a remarkable discovery. The force of the quake appears to have pushed Turkey about four feet closer to Europe. **********Due to steady pressures beneath Turkish soil, the country had already been moving westward at a rate of about one-tenth of an inch a year. The shock of the earthquake produced a sudden acceleration in that movement. **********More significant, though, has been the fact that since the quake, Turkey and Europe have moved closer not just geologically, but also politically and psychologically. **********Almost every European country has rushed to send relief aid to Turkey. The most recent was Sweden, which announced on Friday that it would contribute $4.8 million. **********The European Union sent $3.8 million in emergency aid last week, and has announced that it will allocate another $41.8 million to build housing for survivors. **********Private fund-raising in Europe has also been remarkably successful. A two-hour television appeal in Germany raised $7 million, and a similar campaign in the Netherlands produced $13 million. **********Efforts are under way to convert this wave of sympathy into a permanent policy change that could help heal the breach between Turkey and Europe. **********President Jacques Chirac of France has sent a letter to leaders of the other 14 member states of the European Union urging that the union take this opportunity to develop a ''new strategy'' for dealing with Turkey. Responses in many capitals were favorable, suggesting that the two-year-old freeze in dialogue between Turkey and Europe may soon end. **********The freeze began after the European Union decided in December 1997 to exclude Turkey from the group of nations negotiating for European Union membership. Although full membership for Turkey is still a distant prospect, the tone of statements from both sides has become much warmer since the quake. **********Perhaps most significant has been the change in the attitude of Greece, which for years has blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in European Union funds earmarked for Turkey. Greece offered quick and generous aid to earthquake victims, and many ordinary Greeks joined Government leaders in suggesting that this might be an ideal moment for the two historic rivals to move toward friendship. **********''I hope this disaster will mark the start of peaceful coexistence between our two nations,'' Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos of Athens said during a visit to Istanbul this week.  ''Chasms opened by the earthquake can also lead to new roads.'' **********A visit by the Mayor of Greece's biggest city to Turkey's biggest city would have been all but unthinkable before the earthquake. It symbolized the sudden warming in ties between the two countries. **********There are reports that Greece will make a more substantial gesture toward Turkey next month, when European Union foreign ministers meet in Helsinki. Greek leaders are reportedly discussing either lifting their veto of European Union funds that have been earmarked for Turkey, or proposing a generous aid package for reconstruction in the earthquake zone. **********''We hope this tragedy can increase understanding between Turkey and the E.U., and that some of the funds that have been held could be released,'' Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, said on Friday. **********Among Turkish leaders who welcomed recent gestures from Greece was Mesut Yilmaz, who as Prime Minister in 1997 ordered the freeze on political dialogue with Europe. He said he hoped the new warmth between the two countries would quickly be translated into ''general Government policy.'' **********''Turkey and Greece will be neighbors forever,'' Mr. Yilmaz said in a televised interview. ''There are no problems that cannot be solved, no fields than cannot be shared.'' **********''I believe solutions can be found to the Cyprus problem and the Aegean problem as long as the two sides don't always try to get the upper hand,'' he said. ''I see this as an improvement that is not temporary, but permanent.'' **********Perhaps even more surprising than the welcome given to Greek relief workers here was the welcome given to three doctors from Cyprus. The three had hesitated to leave Istanbul, fearing that as representatives of the pro-Greek Government on Cyprus, they would be reviled and perhaps attacked. But they put aside their fears, traveled to the quake zone, and later said they were overwhelmed by the kisses and embraces with which Turks greeted them. **********Even Armenia, whose relations with Turkey have been even frostier than Greece's, extended a hand of friendship after the earthquake. After some hesitation in both countries, including a statement by Turkey's right-wing Minister of Health that Turks should not accept aid from such a historic enemy, Armenia on Friday sent a plane load of aid. **********Although neither Cyprus nor Armenia are members of the European Union, they have lobbied hard against Turkish efforts to win acceptance in Europe. **********With the euphoria with which many Turks and Europeans are greeting news of their reconciliation, there have been some words of caution. Issues that have divided the two sides for years, including European complaints about human-rights abuses in Turkey, have faded from the limelight but still not been resolved. **********Tunca Toskay, a Minister Without Portfolio in the Turkish Government, warned that Turkey would not accept aid from Europe if it is conditioned on changes in Turkish domestic policy. ''We will break the half-loaves of bread that we have into fourths, and refuse that kind of aid,'' he asserted. **********The next sign of Turkey's new-found friendship with Europe may come on Thursday, when the Greek soccer team PAOK Salonika will face the Istanbul team Galatasaray in a hastily arranged match. All profits are to be donated to an earthquake relief fund."

The film, written and directed by Kevin Smith, who made ''Clerks'' and ''Chasing Amy,'' was described by Miramax as a satire that deals with religious issues. **********''We all agreed this is the best way for the film to be presented,'' the Weinstein brothers said in a statement announcing that they would personally buy the negative and film rights. ''All of us look forward to the time when audiences will be able to see the film; it will be properly understood and viewed for film as film's sake.'' **********Harvey Weinstein said in a telephone interview tonight that Disney did not directly ask him to shelve the film. ''What they said is, 'We have a problem,' '' Mr. Weinstein said. ''So we came up with a solution.'' He expressed concern that ''Disney is too easy a target.'' **********''Why make trouble?'' he said. ''I just thought it was time to pre-empt the situation.'' **********In setting up a corporation solely to acquire the rights to the film and sell it to a distributor, the Weinsteins said, ''We intend to work with a distributor that shares our vision of the film.'' The brothers also said they would seek a marketing and distribution partner ''that will fully realize 'Dogma's' potential as broad entertainment.'' **********One Miramax executive said that the Weinsteins, who were triumphal this year at the Academy Awards with films like ''Shakespeare in Love'' and ''Life Is Beautiful,'' would buy ''Dogma'' for its cost. **********The film has a stellar cast including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alanis Morisette, Salma Hayek, Chris Rock, Linda Fiorentino and George Carlin. It was described by Miramax as an adult tale about a hero joined by a band of misfits seeking to save humanity. **********A handful of Disney executives have seen the film. One, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that parts of the movie could be construed as an attack on Catholic dogma. There has been no official comment from the church. **********Responding to the criticism, the Miramax statement said, ''While plot points and characters may be taken out of context, appearing as if Smith is attacking organized religion, the film should be taken as a whole: a satire from a film maker who himself is a practicing Catholic with a solid foundation of love and reverence to faith.'' **********Mr. Smith, the writer-director, said today that ''Dogma'' was ''from first to last always intended as a love letter to both faith and God almighty.'' **********He added: ''It's mind-bending that as we come to the close of this century that anyone would still attack a work that has yet to see the light of day without having seen it themselves.'' **********Miramax has collided with its owner, Disney, before, but never quite so publicly. In 1994, Miramax released a British film, ''Priest,'' about a gay Catholic priest. The film received strong reviews, but some Catholics demonstrated against Disney in protest. **********The following year, another film, ''Kids,'' about aimless teen-agers, was released with an NC-17 rating, meaning no one under 17 allowed. Because of the Disney stricture that the studio would never release an NC-17 rated film, Miramax set up its own distribution to release the movie, which was panned by critics and failed at the box office. **********With more and more conglomerates like Seagram, Viacom and Sony owning independent film companies, collisions have become inevitable between the smaller companies producing unconventional films and their more conservative parents. Last year Seagram's studio arm, Universal, refused to release an October Film movie, ''Happiness,'' because of its sexual themes and content. The film was released at another company. **********It is not known whether Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney, has seen ''Dogma.'' But other top company executives at the Burbank, Calif., headquarters saw the film recently. The one who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was dismayed by it. He said the film was ''inappropriate for all of our labels.'' **********Paying tribute to the Weinsteins, Mr. Smith said, ''As per usual, Bob and Harvey are the only ones willing to stick by us or back our goofy little flicks.'' Mr. Smith applauded their ''great courage,'' and said, '' 'Dogma' is in no way blasphemous or worthy of the mild controversy that seems to be brewing around it.'' **********The Weinsteins added, ''Now that we are ending speculation as to 'Dogma's' distribution, we believe the film will speak for itself and be understood for its artistic intentions and merits.''"

In the United States, about 21 percent of adults cannot read or count; in Britain, about 22; in Germany, about 14; and in Sweden, about 7. **********The figures in the report, issued by the United Nations Human Development Program, mean that nearly one in four Irish adults is seriously impaired, finding it difficult or impossible to find work even in the growing economy of the Celtic Tiger. **********''The finding that 23 percent of the people of this state are unable to  read instructions, a bill or a form, that they are 'functionally illiterate,'  is almost incredible,'' said an editorial in The Irish Times. **********''It's higher than even we thought,'' said Mary Maher, the director of the Adult Learning Center in Dublin. **********Tony Geraghty, a handyman studying at the center, said, ''I felt like my brain was in a cocoon,''  describing his inability to write. ''The words were there, but they wouldn't come out.'' **********He is making progress in both writing and reading. ''I felt like a second-class citizen,'' he said. ''I was ashamed. If my kids asked me for help to spell a word, I would tell them I was busy.'' **********Another student, Michael Ryan, a security guard, said, ''I couldn't read anything, not even street signs.'' He said, ''I couldn't even write my own name.'' **********In Dublin today, about 500 people are in programs to overcome illiteracy, and dozens more are on waiting lists. Another 5,500 people are being helped by programs elsewhere in the country, yet they represent only a small fraction of the people who need instruction, officials say. **********Inez Bailey, director of the nongovernmental National Adult Literacy Agency, said the Government has for decades reflected the public attitude toward the problem: denial. **********In recent years, she said, Government funding for literacy programs has increased to about $7 million, and the Government has stated that its goal is to provide $15 million. Even that, Ms. Bailey said, would help only about 1 percent of the people who are functionally illiterate. **********Ms. Bailey said, ''The word illiterate is not a P.C. word. But the problem still passes from one generation to the next.'' **********The principal reason for the high rate in Ireland, she added, is that in the 1950's and 1960's, with a depressed economy and large emigration, the country did not have the money to provide remedial reading programs for students, who could leave school legally at age 15. **********Class sizes were large, one teacher to 50 pupils, Ms. Bailey said, and teachers had no time to devote to slow learners. **********Today, 44 percent of the nation's illiterates are between age 40 and 65. **********Mary McMahon, 47, recalled that in her youth, in a Dublin inner-city school, ''I don't think the teachers cared whether you learned or not. There were 56 in the class. If you were brainy, they took an interest.''"

If enacted, it would allow a mutual fund to buy and sell securities with an affiliated brokerage house without first seeking regulatory approval, as current law requires. **********The concept has already drawn quiet but unequivocal objections from the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade association. In a letter sent to a top executive of the Securities Industry Association last month, the institute's president, Matthew P. Fink, contended that the proposal would undermine a core protection for mutual fund investors and was ''entirely objectionable'' to the mutual fund industry. **********Yesterday, the top fund industry regulator at the Securities and Exchange Commission said he shared Mr. Fink's fears. Paul Roye, the director of the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, which oversees the fund industry, said in an interview that he was concerned the lobbying group's proposal ''would take us back to the 1930's,'' when mutual funds sponsored by large brokerage houses ''were used as a dumping ground'' for excess inventory or unpopular securities. **********Mr. Roye confirmed fund-industry reports that he would speak against the proposal in his remarks tomorrow at the annual meeting of the Investment Company Institute in Washington. ''I'm expressing my own views, but my speech will reflect the advice I would give to the commission,'' Mr. Roye said. **********Marc Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association, said that he hoped the furor over his group's proposal would not obscure the potential benefits it could bring to mutual fund investors. They could save hundreds of millions of dollars, he said, if their fund managers were not barred from doing business with affiliated broker-dealers. **********Concerns about ''affiliated transactions'' were a minefield in the mutual fund industry since long before the passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the bedrock law that governs the nation's mutual fund industry. **********In Congressional investigations that followed the 1929 market crash, some prominent brokerage houses were criticized for using their mutual funds as buyers of last resort for securities they could not otherwise sell. In response, Congress prohibited any affiliated transactions that the S.E.C. had not approved in advance. **********Some fund industry lawyers and the Investment Company Institute seem to ''view this prohibition as part of Holy Writ and have reacted as if we are trying to amend the Ten Commandments,'' Mr. Lackritz said yesterday. ''What we're really trying to do is find new ways of helping investors,'' he said, by allowing fund managers to take advantage of better prices, more useful products or smoother trade executions that may be available through an affiliate of the fund. **********Besides, he said, the brokerage firms that support the proposal are confident that internal fund rules and policies can be written to prevent fund managers from becoming unwilling participants in trades with affiliates. **********The lobbying group argues that the wholesale ban on self-dealing no longer makes sense ''given the substantial changes in the securities markets in the 60 years'' since it was first adopted. **********But, Mr. Roye of the S.E.C. noted, it is just as difficult today as in 1940 for regulators or fund directors to be certain that a fund manager dealing with an affiliated trading desk is doing what is in the best interest of his investors and not simply giving in to subtle pressure from the parent brokerage house. **********''While it is true that the world has changed somewhat since then, human nature hasn't changed,'' Mr. Roye said. And it was the human temptations that arise when a fund deals with its parent or affiliate that originally prompted Congress to bar such transactions, he noted. **********He added, ''I would hope that, in looking at this, the folks on the Hill would go back and look at why Congress had the wisdom to put this prohibition in there in the first place.''"

As a chorus of laughter subsided, dozens of managers in her audience again leaned forward intently, brows furrowed, arms akimbo. **********Laughter is serious business to executives here, as traditionally staid companies are hiring ''humor consultants'' like Ms. Passanisi to invigorate employees stunned by increasing demands and rapidly changing technology. Banks, phone and computer companies, government agencies and insurance companies -- precisely the businesses that would seem the least receptive -- are among the new clients. **********These consultants are not just there to entertain. Their goal is to teach executives that laughter will work wonders in communicating with employees, perhaps helping them overcome fear of the boss. **********In fact, it can help keep workers healthy, the consultants insist, and they back that up by tossing around fancy words like ''eustress.'' **********Ms. Passanisi began her lecture by discussing the difference between eustress -- a positive stress often sparked by laughter or satisfying work -- and its darker cousin, distress. And she warned the executives that their behavior and manner could create positive or negative stress depending on how they reacted to humor. **********Like many of the consultants interviewed, she insisted that laughter was inevitable -- that jokes would always be told. But if they are not being told to executives, she said, they are often being told about them. **********Demonstrating how she used humor to play off tough situations, Ms. Passanisi donned the 22-inch crab hat that is a hallmark of her lectures. **********''I'm feeling a little crabby today,'' she said. ''Does it show?'' **********Groan. **********Ed Dunkelblaugh, a psychologist and management consultant, said: ''Humor is a tough sell. It's one of those things that everybody believes in but nobody wants to buy.'' **********But humor is, in fact, selling, especially in the computer industry, where business is booming, but the topics at conferences are often dry and the language is full of technical jargon. Ms. Passanisi charges $5,000 an hour for her presentations. **********Humor, to be sure, will never take over corporate America. But at least in seminars, humor is all the rage, and ''the message has been accepted by a lot of strait-laced companies,'' said John Morreall, a Tampa, Fla., management consultant who talks about using humor to sustain employee health and foster a collegial workplace. **********Many consultants say humor, to the extent it helps deal with stress in the workplace, can be used to combat rising health care costs and problems retaining creative talent in a tight job market. Perhaps fittingly, many of them first found work speaking to hospital and insurance industry administrators, doctors and nurses who were receptive to humor researchers like Dr. Lee Berk, a professor at Loma Linda University Medical Center in Loma Linda, Calif. **********Then medical professionals told their spouses and friends in other industries that ''the silliness is real,'' Dr. Berk said. ''I think the corporate world is just starting to catch a hold of that. They've had lots of motivational speakers, but they aren't going out and saying, 'Here's the biological reality of it.' '' **********Enter humor consultants, and stop them if you've heard this one before: Managers who give everybody the heebie-jeebies can hinder creativity and make their workers sick. Big words like pyschoneuroimmunology dispel the appearance of frivolity. **********Laughter is now even discussed at I.B.M.'s Palisades Executive Conference Center, a cathedral to management education just up river from Manhattan in Palisades, N.Y., where senior executives attend four-day seminars. Since 1996, the programs have included Mr. Morreall as a keynote speaker. **********Just five years ago, the idea of putting a humor consultant in front of 500 executives at the I.B.M. center would have been, well, laughable, said Marion Atwater, program director for marketing and advertising at the I.B.M. Advanced Business Institute, which runs the seminars. **********''We never would have featured a humorist because it wouldn't have been in sync,'' Ms. Atwater said. ''It wouldn't have had the audience appeal. If you go back and say, 'What were the audience expectations, late 80's, early 90's?' it wasn't step back and have a laugh, it was get in your Porsche and drive as fast as you can.'' **********The expectations of conference-goers are changing, consultants say, as some American workers set different goals, with more emphasis on leisure and reducing stress than on getting dump trucks full of cash. Many of those workers cannot easily forget the days when intense competition from overseas and a wave of corporate layoffs made it hard to sit back and have a good chuckle. **********''America got a wake-up call,'' said Terry Paulson, a psychologist and professional lecturer. ''What leaders did was say, 'Enough having fun, let's get back to making money, downsizing and adding value.' They didn't take humor seriously. Now we're realizing the value.'' **********The client lists of humor consultants are just one indication that some companies that used to think of laughing as goofing off are beginning to value humor. Ms. Passanisi gets repeat business from SBC Services Inc., the San Antonio company responsible for uniting phone companies in the Southwest. Mr. Paulson has made presentations for the Federal Reserve Board, Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments and the Postal Service. **********Even without calling in consultants, some business leaders in notoriously dull industries are trying to pep up their employees with humor. **********Peter de Jager, president of Year2000 Partnership.com Inc., a company working on the millennium computer problem, has put up $6,000 to sponsor a contest for jokes about the issue. **********''We're like a bunch of kids around a campfire who've scared ourselves so badly that we can't get to sleep,'' said Mr. de Jager, who thinks it is funny that he has been asked to give a Year 2000 presentation in September 1999 when everyone else is panicked about it now. ''This is dull, boring, monotonous work, and unless we take a step back, we're going to burn out. It's hard to laugh about this stuff, but we can.'' **********Mr. de Jager can, at least. ''How many Year 2000 programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?'' he asks. ''None, it isn't broken yet.'' **********Further down the corporate food chain, playfulness is making a comeback after the corporate fretfulness of the late 1980's and early 1990's. **********John Garbo, director of Clinical Data Resources at Daughters of Charity National Health Systems in St. Louis, appreciates this. On weekdays, his charges can be found in a basement staring at computer screens. Except before meetings, when they blow soap bubbles. **********''It puts me in a better mood so that I can be more responsive to my employees' ideas,'' Mr. Garbo said. **********Management professionals are encouraging the bubble blowing and other levity because even the top salaries are sometimes not enough to attract creative people to jobs, such as writing software, that are often filled with tedium. **********And as managers try to link manufacturers, technicians and administrators and the line between manufacturing and service companies blurs, computer companies in particular have been ravaged by ''change, change, change all the time,'' said Carol B. Schoenfeld, director of executive education programs at the I.B.M. Institute. **********Lexmark International, a computer printing products company in Lexington, Ky., hired Ms. Passanisi for seminars during a period the company called re-engineering, which often involves large-scale reorganization of work and has sometimes been used as a code word for downsizing. The ''r'' word ''brings fear to a lot of people, so we had to use humor to get people ready,'' said Wayne Cornelius, the company's manager of education. ''Having the medical research gives us some idea that what we're doing is not frivolous.'' **********Spotting frazzled nerves, it is easy and instinctive for some executives to nudge burned-out workers to tell jokes. That much done, the next selling point for humor consultants is helping to plan corporate humor they cannot be sued for. Because so much of what is funny is sexual by nature, even the naturally lighthearted have reason to play it safe and stay unfunny at work, where sexual harassment lawsuits are an overhanging threat. **********The consultants peddling productive humor stress that a relaxing atmosphere, in which laughter is acceptable, will really take hold only if it comes from the top. At Southwest Airlines, the flight attendants sometimes sing their seat belt instructions, dropping to a whisper to tell passengers the airplane will be moving ''veryveryfast.'' Humor consultants credit Herbert D. Kelleher, the airline's screwball founder. **********Still, even the most committed humor consultants acknowledge that there are many situations that are simply not amenable to their brand of management advice. Mr. Morreall remembers a lesson he learned on a cold February morning at the Genesee Brewing Company here. **********''You can't use humor as a piece of candy to resolve your hunger,'' Mr. Morreall said. ''These guys were damn resentful. Some of them turned their bodies 90 degrees to avoid looking at me.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/17/business/investing-with-lisa-b-nurme-mfs-equity-income-fund.html,Carole Gould,1999-10-17,,927,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,INVESTING WITH -- Lisa B. Nurme; MFS Equity Income Fund,INVESTING WITH -- Lisa B. Nurme; MFS Equity Income Fund," **********HOW is a value investor like Lisa B. Nurme doing at a growth-oriented money management firm like MFS Investments? Very well, thank you. As portfolio manager of the $141.4 million MFS Equity Income fund, which is intensely focused on the shares of inexpensive companies, Ms. Nurme has managed to stay competitive with her MFS peers at a time when most value managers are struggling. **********Standing apart from the crowd, she said, is part of the discipline. **********''Value investors have to traffic in unpopular areas of the market,'' she said, acknowledging that she usually eats lunch alone in her Boston office, overlooking the Charles River.  ''Company is not necessarily something you want or need.'' **********Her independent stance has paid off for investors. MFS Equity Income has returned 20 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Oct. 8, compared with 15.5 percent for its large value peers, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. The Standard & Poor's Barra Value Index, which tracks large-capitalization value stocks, returned 19.2 percent over that period, reinvesting dividends weekly. **********Ms. Nurme, 36, looks at those United States companies with market capitalizations of more than $1 billion and dividend yields above the average for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, now 1.35 percent. That results in a universe of 2,200  domestic companies. She is far less formal in her screening of foreign companies, tending to focus on blue-chip European stocks. **********A stock's dividend yield is key to her analysis, but not because of the quarterly checks. ''I use income as a tool to measure value,'' she explained. ''Relative yields show whether a stock or industry is cheap compared to its history.'' **********She whittles the group to about 350  companies by eliminating stocks with price-to-earnings ratios that are more than 75 percent of that of the S. & P. 500, 22.7 for 2000. ''It's a very expensive market, so a nice discount to market is warranted,'' she said. ''In a less highly valued market, the discount might be smaller.'' **********Unlike many of her value rivals, she avoids distressed companies and so-called turnaround situations, preferring less risky businesses. ''These are companies with solid business franchises, healthy balance sheets and good cash flow,'' she said. **********To pick the fund's 100 to 125 stocks, Ms. Nurme and 31 MFS analysts spend about one day out of five visiting companies. The goal is to gauge  management's mettle. ''When you deal with what looks like a cheap stock,'' she said, ''you don't want management that will stand in the way of your realizing value.'' **********Ms. Nurme said she also used such visits to help assess a company's business franchise. She looks at the potential market of a company, its ability to gain market share and whether it has a competitive edge, like a better product. **********Cash flow is a key, too. ''We like to see companies that generate excess cash, which is returned to the shareholders in dividends or share repurchases, preferably both,'' she said.  She tends to own stocks in slower-growth industries like utilities,  where excess cash is typically not needed to expand. **********SHE recently added to her position in Bell Atlantic, having initially bought shares in March at $54.42 each. ''Bell is evolving from a regional Bell operating company, traditionally a provider of local telephone service with modest growth rates and high dividend yields,'' she said, ''into a company that provides the full range of services, including local, long distance, wireless and data.'' **********Once Bell Atlantic enters a planned joint venture with Vodafone Airtouch of Britain and completes its merger with GTE, she said, about one-third of revenues should come from wireless and data -- far more profitable areas than traditional, land-based voice services. **********The stock, now yielding 2.41 percent, trades at $63.875, or 19.7 times her 2000 earnings estimate of $3.25 a share. She expects the stock to reach $85 in 12 months and sees a three-year earnings growth rate of 15 percent a year, starting in 2001. **********In June, Ms. Nurme bought shares of Akzo Nobel, a chemical and pharmaceuticals company based in the Netherlands, for 40.26 euros. Akzo Nobel's business mix, she said, ''is changing from a cyclical mix of chemicals and fiber to higher-profit-margin specialty chemicals and drugs.'' **********Its pharmaceutical division is producing two new profitable drugs -- Puregon, a fertility drug, and Remeron, an antidepressant. The stock yields 2.55 percent. She expects annual earnings growth of 15 percent annually for the next three years and thinks the stock could hit 56 euros in 12 months; it is now at 38.25 euros, or 13 times her predicted 2000 earnings of 2.95 euros a share. **********In April, Ms. Nurme paid $42.48 a share for National Fuel Gas, a natural-gas utility serving western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. In addition to its distribution business, it has an oil and gas operation, largely on the Gulf Coast, and operates a gas pipeline. **********Shares are cheap, she asserted,  ''because the company is viewed as a boring gas utility.'' However, production from its oil operation on the Gulf is increasing 20 percent in 1999 and 2000, she said, adding: ''We expect gas pricing to remain strong.'' **********The natural-gas pipeline business is consolidating, she noted. National Fuel ''is one of the few remaining large independent distribution and pipeline companies,'' she said, ''and could be very attractive as a takeover candidate.'' **********She predicted that its earnings would grow 10 percent a year, on average, over the next three years.  The stock, yielding 3.88 percent, trades at $47.9375, or 14.3 times her 2000 earnings estimate of $3.35. She expects the stock to hit the low $60's over 12 months."

That means that when the World Trade Organization admits new members, or the International Monetary Fund approves a loan request, their decisions should be economically objective and politically neutral. **********Few countries would accept their authority if they were swayed by short-term political considerations, or if they were simply instruments of Western policy โ as some in the developing world, in fact, suspect. **********Of course, in a broad historical sense, the international financial institutions reflect Western values. It is certainly the hope of the United States and its allies, for instance, that the institutions will help to turn the West's two main geopolitical rivals, Russia and China, into market democracies subject to the rule of international law. **********It is also true that the IMF and the World Bank have not been immune from political meddling by Washington. The IMF itself, in negotiating loans with applicant governments, will also listen to arguments that its conditions are too strict to be politically acceptable โ that they might cause riots in the streets, as once happened in Egypt. **********But by and large, the institutions have not favored one country over another for political reasons and they have tried to stay out of political arguments among their members. When they get dragged into those arguments the results are likely to be very harmful. **********Unfortunately, a wave of damaging politicization is now washing over both the IMF in Washington and the World Trade Organization in Geneva. The WTO is in crisis partly because militant representatives of developing countries are trying to turn the selection of a new director-general into a political confrontation between rich and poor nations. **********The politicization of China's WTO entry is being stepped up both in Washington and Beijing โ with China linking progress in the negotiations to U.S. behavior in the wake of NATO's accidental bombing of its embassy in Belgrade, and many in Washington objecting to China's membership because of Chinese espionage in the United States. **********Not only does that imply that a central issue for the future of the world trading system may be decided for the wrong reasons. Beijing's attitude could also be seen as reinforcing some Western fears that China might put political considerations ahead of its commercial obligations once it became a WTO member. **********But another egregious example of politicization has now been provided by President Bill Clinton and other leaders at the summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Cologne last weekend, who appeared to have promised President Boris Yeltsin that they would put pressure on the IMF to release more funds for Russia. **********Such a disbursal โ apparently fudging the issue of whether Russia fulfills the fund's conditions for new lending โ would clearly be a reward for Russia's help in pulling NATO's chestnuts out of the fire in Yugoslavia. **********Indeed, just before the Cologne meeting, a G-7 official was quoted as saying that Russia would only get its money if it agreed to terms for the participation of its forces in NATO's peacekeeping operations in Kosovo. **********That is using the fund for political micromanagement in a way that totally undermines its proper function โ to help countries in economic difficulties get their affairs in order. The fund's conditions are not there to annoy Russia, but to help it pull out of economic crisis. **********It is true that both Russia and China have been playing the same game. Moscow officials last week broadly hinted that their government might be more amenable over Kosovo if it could be sure of getting the IMF money. **********Beijing has tried to use its WTO entry negotiations as a lever to exact short-term U.S. political gestures, including a more groveling apology for the embassy bombing and punishment for the ""perpetrators."" **********But China's WTO entry is too important to be left to the political whims of the moment, either in Washington or Beijing. And the role of the IMF in the world economy is too important to be dictated by politico-military wheeling and dealing between Washington and Moscow. **********It may be impossible, even undesirable, to banish politics entirely from world economic decisions. But blatant political abuse of the institutions risks doing them serious damage in the longer term. That is in nobody's interest. **********- **********E-mail address: Thinkahead@iht.com"

The average United States  diversified stock fund returned 18.8 percent, the fattest gain for any quarter since 1982, when the business was less than one-eighth its present size. **********Buoyed by a Federal Reserve whose interest-rate cuts clearly reflected more concern about heading off world recession than about fueling stock prices, the market rewarded the overwhelming majority of fund investors who, rather than running for cover, either sat tight during the midyear turbulence or used it to pick up bargains. **********Their persistence allowed their fund managers to avoid the necessity of selling shares or husbanding cash. And the rewards in many cases were fourth-quarter returns that exceeded the gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a leading benchmark that has traditionally been hard for stock fund managers to beat. **********But while a half-dozen categories of actively managed stock funds surpassed the 20.9 percent gain in the S.& P., it was growth funds that really excelled -- a trend that embraced companies of all sizes. **********Growth funds that invest in stocks with large capitalizations -- capitalization is the total market value of all of a company's shares -- jumped an average of 26.3 percent in the October-through-December period and 36.5 percent for all of 1998. Mid-cap funds also rallied and came in a close second, up 26.1 percent for the quarter and 18.3 percent for the year. **********In an even sharper recovery, beaten-down small-cap growth funds racked up a 24 percent fourth-quarter advance that hoisted their full-year return from negative territory to a 4.3 percent gain. **********For the growth funds, the chief advantage was economic turmoil abroad, which caused fears of a recession at home. Companies that are not closely tied to the business cycle were at a premium, and many investors sought quality within the stock market. **********In particular, many growth funds had a high representation of telecommunications and technology stocks, which rebounded with a vengeance. Some fund managers have even ventured into Internet rockets like Amazon.com, the bookseller, and Ebay, an auctioneer, which rose 187.8 percent and 435.4 percent, respectively, in the quarter. **********Specialty funds that hold the stocks of technology companies did best of all, surging 41.7 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. **********But bond funds, to the surprise of some people, were flat by comparison. Indeed, 15 of 21 classifications eked out gains of less than 1 percent. Long-Term Government funds lost 1.2 percent, on average. Emerging-markets bond funds returned 12.3 percent, in contrast to disastrous quarters earlier in the year. This disappointing fate for the bond funds, analysts said, showed that investors had anticipated the Fed's rate cuts, the first of which came during September. **********Many investors seeking refuge from foreign turmoil moved to Treasuries, largely ignoring corporate and tax-exempt municipal issues. Funds investing in convertible bonds, sometimes a substitute for stocks, were high performers for the quarter. **********Although much of Asia remains in recession, markets there rebounded smartly on anticipations of recovery. Stock funds investing in Pacific Rim countries and Asia, but excluding Japan, rose an average of 27.6 percent in the fourth quarter. But these funds still suffered a loss of 10.4 percent for all of 1998. **********Matthews Korea and Matthews Pacific Tiger were the biggest international winners in the quarter, soaring 102 percent and 40.5 percent, respectively. Fidelity's Japan Small Company fund surged 34.8 percent. **********THE remarkable stock-market comeback in the United States and elsewhere followed one of the worst selloffs in years, producing a sharp whipsaw for some investors who played the game of trying to time the market's ups and downs. **********But the revelation of 1998 may well be the steadfastness of the nation's 67 million fund investors, about half of whom also own stocks directly, when confronted with a mid-July to early-October plunge that many argue was a genuine, if compressed, bear market. **********Despite industry assurances that an overwhelming majority of shareholders would stand fast, there were skeptics. When the sun is shining, they argued, it is easy for investors to say they'll hang in there -- especially if they have never suffered through such a slump before. But when the storm comes, they added, many people change their tune. **********Yet investors were resilient. ''The selloff was fairly steep, and the reaction was very mild,'' said John Rea, chief economist at the Investment Company Institute. For the first time since 1990, equity fund investors in August sold more than they bought,  but the outflow was a mere four-tenths of 1 percent of assets, he said. **********And while the effects of the plunge lingered into the fourth quarter, when inflows lagged behind, Mr. Rea contended that one thing had become clear: ''Long-term investors are willing to accept some short-term volatility.'' **********Still, a few months' decline -- and even the considerably longer slump for small-company stocks -- is not as brutal or disheartening as a more traditional bear market, like the one that lasted for most of 1973 and 1974 and slashed the value of blue-chip stocks by 40 percent. **********Almost as big as the market's emphasis on growth during the latest quarter was its preference for larger companies. **********''If you were in big growth companies, you were in fat city,'' said Robert C. Doll, chief investment officer at Oppenheimer Funds in New York, which has 50 funds with a total of  $100 billion in assets. ''But if you were small and value-oriented, you got taken to the cleaners.'' **********Sheer size is increasingly important, agreed Beth Terrana, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Fund, a $9.7 billion member of the giant Fidelity Investment group, which has been generally shedding a reluctance to pay premium prices for the most popular large-cap stocks. **********''I've been very strongly in favor of big-cap stocks,'' she said. ''The world has become excruciatingly competitive,'' she added, and in a slow-growth environment ''he who spends the most normally wins.'' Large-cap companies have the financial heft to spend with abandon. **********The biggest stocks tend to be bought by the biggest funds, since managers can take meaningful positions in them without unduly affecting prices. **********Indeed, the biggest fund of all, Fidelity Magellan, with $83.6 billion in assets, not only outperformed the S.& P. 500 last year for the first time since 1993, but recorded a fourth-quarter gain of 27.2 percent, second-highest among the nation's largest 25 funds. First was the Janus Fund, at 28.4 percent. **********Robert Stansky, Magellan's manager repositioned the fund, which is closed to most new investors, late in the summer; he piled into growth stocks and beaten down high-technology issues. **********For the full year, Magellan's 33.6 percent advance was surpassed among giant funds only by the Janus Fund, at 38.9 percent; Fidelity Blue Chip Growth, up 34.8 percent, and American Century Twentieth Century Ultra, up 34.6 percent. **********Despite recent successes by portfolio managers, passive investment continues to grow. Money is pouring into Vanguard 500 Index, now the second-biggest fund, at $74 billion. **********A rising proportion of fund buyers, newly sensitive to advisory fees, trading costs and tax issues, are willing to settle for returns that come close to matching market averages rather than chasing the hot-shot manager of the day, said Kurt Cerulli, principal of Cerulli Associates, a research and investment counseling firm in Boston. **********''The argument for indexing is pretty compelling,'' Mr. Cerulli said, noting that management fees for index funds run as little as one-fifth of a percentage point a year, compared with three or four times as much for the typical fund. Fees can exceed 1.5 percent when other expenses, like marketing charges, are included. **********While the market was showering large and growth-oriented funds with outsized gains, managers bent on sniffing out value in undiscovered or beaten-down or cyclically depressed shares remain frustrated. **********''It's painful'' being out of fashion, said Ronald Spaulding, the value-oriented chief investment officer for eight stock funds and five bond funds advised by the Safeco Corporation of Seattle. ''The market always returns to value, to fundamentals, at some point. The question is timing.'' **********The underperformance of value managers persisted throughout the year; particularly striking was the chasm that developed between investment extremes, noted John Rekenthaler, research director at Morningstar. Investors in the average small-cap value fund suffered a 7 percent loss during 1998, while large-cap growth funds climbed 36.5 percent, on average, a difference of 43.5 percent. ''I haven't seen the like of it,'' Mr. Rekenthaler said. ''I'd be surprised if we've ever had a number that large.'' **********ONE lesson may be that fund performance, at least in the short term, often depends more on investment fashion than on the skills of portfolio managers. In practice, this means that because fashion is as fickle in markets as in clothes, it makes no sense to chase after last year's winners. **********Yet choice in mutual funds -- by some counts there are now more funds than stocks -- continues to expand. The proliferation is prompting many investors who once regarded funds as simplifying their investment life to seek professional help with complexity. **********One new fund is a closed-end offering called Value Line No. 1 Strategy Trust. It will invest in the 100 stocks given a top ranking for timeliness -- defined as a likelihood to rise more quickly than other stocks -- by the Value Line Investment Survey. **********Some new products border on the eccentric. Trying a different take on the indexing phenomenon, the new Guinness Flight Wired Index fund will invest in 40 so-called new blue chips, as designated by Wired Magazine. The Wired list is intended to track the information economy of the next century, much as the Dow Jones industrial average, started in 1896, was intended to track the industrial economy of the 20th century. **********The companies it chose, Wired said, display ''not just intelligent use of technology, but also more abstract notions, including globalism, innovation and strategic vision.''"

The PC Lives! Can 2 Extremes Both Be Right?,TECHNOLOGY & MEDIA; The PC Is Dead! The PC Lives! Can 2 Extremes Both Be Right?," **********In 1999 it became fashionable to predict the end of the PC era. **********At the vast Comdex personal computer trade show in Las Vegas in November, the buzz seemed to be about everything but the personal computer. **********There was hype about Web pads -- handy, wireless slates for surfing the Web, in effect portable computers with screen but without keyboard. And there was more hype about Internet appliances, which are devices other than computers that provide Web access. **********Even William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman who is high priest of the PC, took time out from his presentation to showcase what he called a Web companion, a computer that eschews the Windows operating system in gaining access to the Web. It looks much like the ''network appliance'' that Mr. Gates once reviled when it was first proposed by his company's rivals, Sun Microsystems and the Oracle Corporation. **********The most hoopla of all surrounded a coming generation of cellular phones that are part phone and part computer and will allow mobile users to surf the Web and do everything from shopping to making restaurant reservations from wherever they are. **********By comparison, the PC's on display, whose makers seemed focused on repackaging their machines in different-colored boxes, appeared drab and uninspired. **********It has begun to seem that, like the mainframe computer, the venerable PC may be on the verge of being supplanted -- by more powerful technologies promising quick and easy access to the Internet through devices that are highly portable, less costly and readily adopted by non-PC users. **********Indeed, hot Silicon Valley companies like Phone.com, the telephone Web browser company based in Redwood City, Calif., are reporting gleefully that beginning next year, almost half the cellular phones sold will come equipped with the ability to surf the Web. Moreover, they predict that at the current growth rate, the number of Web browsers in phones will exceed the number in PC's in 2001. **********''There's no doubt that personal mobile communication is going to happen,'' said Greg Galanos, a software strategist at Motorola. ''The fact that you're chained to the desk to do electronic mail makes no sense at all today.'' **********If using the Internet rather than spreadsheets and word processors is driving the growth of the personal computer industry, then mobile access to the Internet is likely to dominate in short order. Who could possibly argue that surfing the Web while trapped sitting in a chair at a desk is natural or inevitable? **********The one flaw in this argument is that PC sales are not shrinking. PC industry growth has been in double-digit figures for six years, and it is expected to strengthen this year to 20.6 percent, near the 21.3 percent increase posted for 1994-95, according to Dataquest, the market research firm based in San Jose, Calif. **********In his keynote address this year at Comdex, Mr. Gates boasted that industry analysts have underestimated industry growth for decades. ''Year after year, people look at the personal computer and think: 'Wow! It must have reached its peak,' '' he said. ''There hasn't been a year that analysts haven't said: 'Well, this is really it. Boy, the growth has been so fantastic over the last year; this has got to be where it cuts off.' '' **********Mr. Gates's view is shared by Steven P. Jobs, a rival who became a nominal ally after Microsoft invested in Apple Computer in 1997. Mr. Jobs has argued forcefully in the last two years that there is no reason to assume that innovation -- and thus growth -- is dead in the PC world. **********To underscore his point, Apple's new iBook portable personal computer became the top-selling portable in November. The machine has a built-in antenna and permits a user to easily insert a card, costing about $100, to provide high-speed wireless connections. **********Continued growth is a strong argument in favor of the PC, but the same argument was made by defenders of the mainframe computer in the late 1980's, shortly before that industry began its collapse. **********The problem with defending the PC in this debate is that the rise of the Internet has changed the role of the PC. Rather than an end in itself, the PC is now merely one of a variety of Internet entry points. **********''The advent of the Internet has shifted the focus of the industry from 'personal computing' to the Internet and e-business,'' said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of International Business Machines Corporation's Internet division. ''The glamour is all in the Internet and e-business.'' **********Moreover, the attack on the PC industry may soon be joined on the video game front. In an editorial last month titled ''A Billion Connected PC's? Guess Again,'' the editors of Microprocessor Report, an influential semiconductor industry newsletter, took issue with the Intel Corporation's view that PC's will continue to dominate ''personal computing'' in the future. **********They pointed out that two big Japanese consumer electronics companies, Sony and Nintendo, have both placed billion-dollar-plus bets on semiconductor factories to build a new generation of chips that may be more powerful than the fastest Intel microprocessors. **********Sony is readying its PlayStation 2, while Nintendo is developing a new system, code-named Dolphin. Using the new chips, both of these machines will probably be part video-game player, part Internet appliance. **********''Which would you rather have in your living room: a Windows 98 PC or a Sony PlayStation 2?'' the Microprocessor Report editorial asks. ''For most people, the Play Station 2 is a better choice.'' **********As a result, computers are almost certain to become like electric motors. Once upon a time, it was envisioned that one electric motor, equipped with pulleys and cables, would run appliances all through the house. Instead, there are now electric motors in every appliance. **********With computing, ''I think it's more of a morphing,'' Mr. Galanos of Motorola said. ''The fine line between the PC industry and the consumer electronics industry will increasingly vanish.'' **********If it is ending, the PC era has been a remarkable two decades. From its roots in a hobbyist subculture populated by a handful of long-haired engineers who hungered for their own machines, the personal computer exploded to create powerful industrial monopolies. But Moore's Law -- that the number of transistors on a microchip will double every year and a half -- ensures that no computing era will last forever, not even that of the PC."

Clark, the four-star American general who as Supreme Allied Commander Europe is in charge of the powerful NATO air offensive against Serbia for its attacks against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, knows his adversary well. **********Too well, perhaps, mused an allied diplomat, not an American, who said today that he thought that the general was intellectually the most impressive chief the alliance had ever had, but that he was fixated on the idea that force was the only language the Serb leadership understood. **********General Clark, 54, arrived at that conviction through long experience with President, Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. It was Mr. Milosevic's refusal to accept a peace agreement  for Kosovo that would involve 28,000 NATO peacekeepers that made the bombing inevitable, the general and other allied leaders say. **********''We are going to systematically attack, disrupt, degrade, devastate and, ultimately, unless President Milosevic complies with the demands of the international community, we're going to destroy these forces, with their facilities,'' the general said in characteristically forceful language. **********He was describing a bombing campaign that allied officials say could destroy the Yugoslav National Army as an effective fighting force. **********He personified the battle, as generals often do. When reporting that two American F-15 fighters and a Dutch F-16 apparently shot down at least three Yugoslav MIG-29's in dogfights on Wednesday night, General Clark referred to the Yugoslav MIG's as ''some of his most advanced and capable aircraft,'' with ''his'' referring not to an abstract enemy, but to Mr. Milosevic personally. **********General Clark's short well-groomed gray hair and piercing eyes (he wears contact lenses) bespeak an intensity shown throughout his Army career over 30 years. His intimate familiarity with Mr. Milosevic and his thinking stems from the hundreds of hours that he spent with the Serbian leader in 1994 and 1995, when General Clark was Richard C. Holbrooke's military adviser on Mr. Holbrooke's quest as a special envoy to end the Bosnia war. **********On one trips, three other members of their team were killed in an accident on the dangerous Mount Igman road to Sarajevo, forced to take that route by the Bosnian Serb refusal to guarantee their safety on a more direct one. General Clark rappelled down a steep mountainside to try to rescue the victims from their burning armored personnel carrier. **********In the marathon negotiations that Mr. Holbrooke brokered in Dayton, Ohio, in November 1995, after Mr. Milosevic had abandoned the Bosnian Serb cause, General Clark oversaw the drafting of the military chapter of a pact that gave free rein to a NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia. As senior NATO officer, he now leads that force, and the British commander of the similar force planned for Kosovo under the peace accord would report to him, too. **********Was there a hint of exasperation in his remark that bombing Yugoslavia to make it willing to make peace was the culmination of a long -- in fact quite long -- planning process? **********People who know him say General Clark is much too politically astute to express publicly any impatience with the long -- in fact quite long -- hesitation that President Clinton and other allied leaders showed in reaching the decision on force in Kosovo. **********Unusually, General Clark had no  command experience in Europe before Mr. Clinton put him in charge of the alliance's military establishment, as well as the 100,000 American troops stationed in Europe, in July 1997. **********General Clark was director of strategic plans and policy on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon when Mr. Holbrooke drafted him for his missions in Bosnia. General Clark then went to Panama to take charge of the United States Southern Command for a year before taking up his NATO duties at Mons, Belgium. **********The general and Mr. Clinton both grew up in Arkansas, and both were Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University in the 1960's, though they only grew to know each other well later. **********Mr. Clinton avoided military service. But General Clark graduated first in his class from West Point in 1966 and received a master's in philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford before starting his rise through the ranks as a ''tanker,'' or armor officer, in Vietnam, where he received the Silver Star and sustained four wounds. **********''He is always totally focused on whatever he's doing,'' an old friend said. ''When he skis, he wants to be first down the hill, and he has gone into every job he has ever had with incredible intensity. He has never had an easy job.''"

They were feared. They were profiled in glossy magazines. Now many managers of value funds are bleeding assets as the funds, as a group, lag behind broad benchmarks like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. How are some of these managers coping? **********At the Short Hills, N.J., offices of Franklin Mutual Advisers, the onetime proteges of Michael F. Price, the renowned value investor, continue to focus on out-of-favor stocks. They favor the advice of Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd in their 1934 value investor's bible, ''Security Analysis'': Buy $1 worth of assets for 50 cents. **********That deep-value style was trumped last year by growth investing. Relatively speaking, performance hasn't been bad: While the flagship Mutual Shares fund lost 2.9 percent over the past 12 months, it beat the average mid-cap value fund by 6.2 percent, even as its largest holding, the Sunbeam Corporation, fell 87.4 percent. And the fund, with about $8 billion in assets, was up 4.9 percent in the first quarter. The family's other big funds -- Mutual Beacon, Mutual Qualified and Mutual Discovery -- reported similar returns. **********Still, in January and February, investors pulled $2.5 billion from the four funds, according to AMG Data Services. **********''As surely as growth in certain periods will be the rage and will attract the money and investment for that period, it will ultimately end,'' said Larry Sondike, a co-manager of the Shares and Beacon funds. **********Among his current holdings, J. C. Penney, which slid from $77 last June to $40.4375 on Thursday, reminds him of Sears, Roebuck, a stock that the Mutual Series funds bought in the early 1990's and that tripled in value as the retailer spun off Dean Witter and Allstate. **********Penney's Eckerd drugstore unit and an insurance subsidiary are worth $30 a share combined, Mr. Sondike said. The company has over $6 billion in debt, but it also has a department store and catalogue business with almost $4 a share in operating income last year. **********To Martin J. Whitman, the market has rarely carried so much danger -- or opportunity. The manager made his name buying distressed companies; lately, he has bet big on Japan and on United States semiconductor equipment makers. In the first quarter, investors pulled $161.5 million out of his $1.3 billion flagship, the Third Avenue Value fund, which lost 8.2 percent in the quarter. **********The recent market run-up is ''dangerous'' and ''scary,'' he said, reminiscent of the narrow market dominated by the Nifty 50 in the days before the 1973-74 selloff. **********One of his favorite stocks now is Tejon Ranch, a land development and agribusiness concern. Its shares nearly tripled after he bought a large stake in 1997 but have since fallen back to $16.5625, a few dollars more than what he paid. **********William J. Nasgovitz, manager of Heartland Value, says he has seen bad situations before. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the fund dropped 30 percent in a few months -- twice as much as the S.& P. But over the next three years, the fund returned a cumulative 157 percent; the index rose 59 percent. **********That is little solace now, as he watches investors withdraw money from his fund -- including $245 million in the last three months. ''The client pressure is just intense,'' he said. ''People are caving in.'' **********Corporate acquirers have noticed the bargains he holds. Ten companies in the fund's portfolio of more than 300 stocks have been taken over this year. ''If that continues, we won't have any stocks left by Thanksgiving,'' Mr. Nasgovitz said."

''I keep hearing that the PC is dead, but when I look at the next couple of years that's not what I see at all.'' **********Apple Computer, which itself was all but given up for dead a few years ago, has had a remarkable resurrection. Eleven days ago, the company exceeded analysts' estimates in reporting its sixth consecutive profitable quarter. For the last two quarters, it has held more than 12 percent of the retail and mail-order PC market. And the company is once again one of the nation's top five makers of personal computers. **********Moreover, while manufacturers on the Microsoft-Intel side of the PC industry are being pinched by prices that are spiraling below $500 with no end in sight, Apple, the ''Think Different'' company, is busily selling a line of desktop computers whose price begins at $1,500, helping raise Apple's profit margin more than a point from last year, to 26.2 percent. **********''Apple understands simplicity, branding and style,'' said Charles Wolf, a Wall Street analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. ''It's amazing that nobody on the PC side gets it.'' **********To the outside world, Apple's charismatic co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, gets much of the public credit for what is certainly one of the most remarkable turnarounds in American corporate history. **********But the secret to Mr. Jobs's successful return to Apple is the small manufacturing and design team and the highly disciplined engineering process that Mr. Rubinstein has quietly put in place during the last two years. **********It is this team that is responsible for the popular iMac machines Apple began shipping last August, for the critically acclaimed G3 desktop and portable machines that updated Apple's moribund Macintosh and Powerbook lines, and for a new low-priced portable to be introduced in the next few months. **********''The Apple you and I knew two years ago is dead,'' said Andrew Gore, editor in chief of Macworld, the trade magazine that tracks Apple more closely than any other publication. ''It's a completely different company. It's unfortunate that Apple has chosen to keep Jon Rubinstein under wraps.'' **********Those familiar with Mr. Rubinstein, 42, know him as someone who has spent his entire career evolving with the computer industry. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering at Cornell University, and a master's in computer science from Colorado State University, he moved to California, where he became a computer work station designer for Hewlett-Packard before joining Ardent, a start-up supercomputer company. **********From there, he caught on with Next Computer, the company Mr. Jobs founded in 1986 after being forced out at Apple. Mr. Rubinstein ran Next's hardware engineering until the company shifted to an all-software approach. He left to set up an independent hardware design firm that Mr. Rubinstein subsequently sold to Motorola in 1996 -- part of the proceeds of which he planned to spend wandering the world. **********Two months into his sojourn, Mr. Rubinstein was touring Scotland when a phone call caught up with him. It was from Gilbert Amelio, who had recently been brought in as the chairman of Apple. Apple had run up losses in 1996 and 1997 totaling $1.86 billion and was being counted out of the game by virtually everyone in the personal computer industry. But offered the job of running Apple's hardware operations, Mr. Rubinstein agreed instantly. **********In fact, Mr. Rubinstein accepted so readily that Mr. Amelio later wondered in his book ''On the Firing Line: My 500 Days at Apple'' whether he had been the victim of a palace coup. It was on the advice of Mr. Jobs  that Mr. Amelio hired not only Mr. Rubinstein but also Avi Tevanian, who was then head of software at Next and now has that job at Apple. **********Perhaps it was all part of a secret plan by Mr. Jobs to recapture Apple, Mr. Amelio wondered in print, after he had been ousted by a board that brought Mr. Jobs back to run the company temporarily -- an arrangement that has continued for 20 months and counting. **********''That would be news to me,'' Mr. Rubinstein said of the conspiracy theory. He came to Apple, he said, because he saw himself as first and foremost a desktop computer designer and he thought that the company, even in its deepest crises, was the place to be. **********''It was a no-brainer,'' he recalled. ''Apple was the last innovative high-volume computer maker in the world.'' **********From a highly disorganized company where as many as four independent engineering teams might work simultaneously to design the same computer, Apple is now working on a dozen projects using cooperating, interdisciplinary teams -- using what Mr. Rubinstein refers to as a ''fast-track design.'' The approach puts many parts of the design process in parallel, speeding time to market. **********''I look at this as having a bag of technology tricks, and at the appropriate time I bring them out and put them in our products,'' he said. ''And we have more in our bag of tricks.'' **********Colleagues say that Mr. Rubinstein is obsessive about checklists, which have now been built into every facet of Apple's engineering system. **********And when things fall through the check lists, Apple's designers take a SWAT team approach to fixing bugs. **********When the company's innovative iMac computer first shipped last year, Mr. Rubinstein attended a midnight store opening celebration in Palo Alto, Calif. By the next morning, after hearing consumer complaints at the store and on Macintosh enthusiasts' Web sites, he knew that the machine had some problems -- the worst being that the computer did not work with a newly designed Epson printer. A software patch was created in a matter of days and widely distributed with the aid of the Internet, side-stepping a potentially serious public relations stumble for the new iMac. **********The Epson episode could have been much worse. Several years before Mr. Rubinstein's arrival, several of the company's new Powerbook portable machines actually caught fire while in use. The machine had to be withdrawn from the market, and for more than a quarter Apple went without revenue from an important part of its product line. **********If Mr. Rubinstein's team is more efficient than Apple's earlier hardware groups, it is also a remarkably more insular and frequently secretive organization -- perhaps the clearest break from the former Apple Computer, so porous that it was known in some circles as ''a ship that leaks from the top.'' **********Indeed, among the Valley's digerati the company is now referred to as ''Jobs & Company,'' and Apple has adopted an almost Japanese-style adherence to the ideal of the unified team. **********But Mr. Rubinstein dismisses the popular notion that Mr. Jobs can act as a capricious tyrant. **********''I love working with Steve,'' he said. ''We make a good team, and he raises the bar on me.'' **********Yet, while working to uphold Mr. Jobs's exacting standards, Mr. Rubinstein may provide an important buffer between Jobs & (the rest of the) Company. ''He is absolutely unflappable,'' said Glen Miranker, Mr. Rubinstein's vice president for desktop systems. ''It's a particular value in the present environment.'' **********There are those outside Apple who are skeptical about the company's  resurgence. They note that with the exception of the iMac, which has found a market both in first-time computer users and former owners of Microsoft-Intel PC's, Apple is still selling to a core group of customers devoted to the Apple Macintosh legacy. **********''I see them being strong for a while and then slowly fading,'' said Seymour Merrin, a computer industry consultant at Merrin Information Services in Palo Alto, Calif. ''They can't afford the development spending that an Intel can make.'' **********Even Apple executives acknowledge that the company has made little headway in corporate markets recently. **********Moreover, despite the company's contention that thousands of new  software applications have been introduced for Apple machines, companies like Nisus Software, which develops applications for the Macintosh and benefited from the industry innovation the Macintosh stimulated during the 1980's and early 1990's, say they have yet to feel the impact of the turnaround. **********And others wonder whether the introductions of two successful computers under Mr. Rubinstein -- the iMac and the G3 desktop line -- necessarily mean Apple can sustain its comeback in the highly volatile PC industry. **********''I don't look at this as pulling a rabbit out of the hat,'' Mr. Rubinstein said. ''Our strategy has a lot of dimension, from industrial design to performance to functionality.'' **********That claim will be put to the test late this spring or early summer when Apple introduces its long-awaited entry into the consumer market for portable computers, priced in the $1,000 to $1,500 range. **********With a sleek, gray translucent case and clamshell shape, according to those who have seen it, the computer will be as radical an industrial design departure from the standard boxy notebooks as the iMac was from the conventional desktop PC. **********Whether the machine -- which Mr. Jobs has reportedly insisted will weigh less than five pounds and have a large flat-panel display -- will be a runaway hit like the iMac is hard to predict. Though certainly another example of Mr. Jobs's think-different philosophy, it will appear while much of the rest of the PC industry is focusing on so-called subnotebooks, which weigh less than four pounds and are the rage among the computer road warrior set. **********Mr. Rubinstein is confident the machine will be a hit, in part because it will incorporate features from the company's heavier laptops, like long battery life and disk-drive bays for floppies, CD-ROM's or DVD's. **********''The industry is waiting to see what we do next,'' he said. ''I heard that some of them are holding back their products and saying, 'I don't want to be iMac'd.' ''"

They had only 75 minutes. They had to shop quickly. **********Andy Garner and John Hall, police officers bound for Euro Disney with their families, were stocking up on cigarettes and beer. Margaret Couch and her daughter, Donna Dickman, heading for France for a day's shopping in Calais, were rifling through the designer sweatshirts. **********Derek Kerr and his sister, Pauline, were explaining how they could save a bundle on supplies for a wake for their recently deceased father by shopping on the boat and in France, where prices are cheaper, and then coming home. **********''We want it to be a festive leave-taking,'' Mr. Kerr said, putting a bottle of whisky in his basket. **********Not too many years ago, cross-Channel ferries were used mainly for one thing, ferrying passengers between Britain and the Continent. But because of steep competition from airlines and from the trains that run through the Channel Tunnel, the ferries have had to lower their prices drastically, and to look elsewhere for revenue. **********As a result, they have turned into floating duty-free shopping centers, discount malls on the water, places where the Channel's famously bad weather and stomach-churning waves are canceled out by the joy of mass spending. **********For the consumer, freed from the burden of having to pay the various taxes the Government imposes on luxuries like cigarettes and alcohol, as well as the 17.5 percent value added tax it places on most goods, the savings are impressive -- even though each passenger is allowed only a certain amount of alcohol and cigarettes per trip. **********According to the Duty-Free Confederation, an industry lobbying group, a carton of 200 Silk Cut cigarettes, which would cost $52.70 in a normal British store, costs $25.30 on the ferry. A liter bottle of Gordon's gin sells for $13, down from $25.25. **********But the $1.6 billion-a-year British duty-free industry may well be living on borrowed time. Eight years ago, the European Commission decreed that as part of the European Union's drive toward harmonization, it would eventually abolish duty-free shopping between European countries. **********If the commission makes good on its pledge, while passengers to countries outside the European Union would still be able to buy discounted perfume, chocolates and handbags, those traveling within Europe would see such opportunities disappear in a flash. **********No more discounted Hermes  scarves at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. No more cheap last-minute gifts from the Harrods outlet at Heathrow, calculated to make your husband think you'd thoughtfully shopped at the actual store. **********Zero hour was set for the end of June 1999, and there seems to be little that anyone can do to stop it. In December, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said his Government would join with France and Germany, which both oppose the change, to try to find a way around it. But without the support of the rest of the European Union countries, it is doubtful whether they will get very far. **********The arguments against duty-free shopping within the new, unified Europe are simple. If borders between Europe are all but dissolved, the thinking goes, then why preserve an anachronistic throwback, a vestige from the days when the borders were serious things and traveling from one European country to another was as laden with red tape as traveling to the United States? And why should one group of people have to subsidize the purchases of another group, who happen to pass through an airport? **********''It is time that people who do not travel stopped having to pay for the boondoggles and beanos of those who do,'' Andrew Mackinlay, a Labor Member of Parliament, declared in a House of Commons debate last spring. **********But his was a lone voice of dissent, drowned out as politicians from all  parts of the political spectrum rushed to defend the inalienable right of Britons to buy cheap luxury goods while on vacation. Supporting duty-free shopping is a popular political position, of course: what politician in his right mind would want to go on the record as meanly opposing his constituents' right to pay less for more? **********Member after member rose to describe the number of jobs that would be lost at airports, ports and in the travel and liquor industries if duty-free shopping were abandoned -- by one estimate, 30,000 in Britain alone. They spoke of the tedium of traveling, of the triumph that comes from buying goods at a discount, of the feeling that duty-free shopping is a right, not a privilege. **********Bill O'Brien, a Labor Member of Parliament, read aloud a letter from a constituent, one Mrs. C. Eason. ''Duty-free shopping is part of the fun of going on holiday,'' she said. ''Everyone likes to think they are 'getting a bargain.' '' **********A Conservative colleague, David Wilshire, argued that duty-free shopping gave people something to do at the airport. ''My main justification, trivial as it may seem, has always been that it is a harmless bit of fun in an otherwise dull world that gets duller by the week,'' he said. **********That's what Raymond Limbert, picking up a case of cigarettes for a friend aboard the ferry, thinks, too. ''I much prefer to shop when I take these trips,'' he said. ''When you go through the tunnel, you're just stuck there.'' **********If the Government abolished duty-free shopping, he said, ferries and package-tour operators would inevitably raise their prices, cramping the style not only of shoppers but also of vacationers accustomed to the low fares. **********''We're the only place in Europe that's on an island,'' he said, ''and this keeps us able to go to Europe cheaply.'' **********Next door in the cosmetics department, the woman behind the counter said she couldn't believe duty-free shopping would ever disappear. ''It's a multibillion-dollar industry, and they're not going to give it up,'' she said, looking nervously around in case her supervisor was eavesdropping. **********She gestured at a pair of women, scooping little pots of anti-wrinkle cream into their shopping baskets. ''Just look at them,'' she said. ''If they couldn't shop, what would they do instead?''"

But what happens to the dream of progress when a young generation is sent to work 10 to 12 hours a day in low-wage factories instead of going to school to learn math, reading, writing and other skills required for true long-range economic development? **********The answer, as once advanced by the Honduran human-rights activist Jorge Sierra, is that such children, who know little of life except long hours of work for low pay, grow into adults ''without imagination, people who believe in nothing, and who will not be able to function in the development that we want for our country.'' **********There is a better way. Companies could hire unemployed parents of these children at livable wages, freeing the younger generation to go to school, preparing themselves to build their nation. Otherwise, Sierra warned, ''by treating our young people as they are being treated, they are destroying our country.'' Isn't it in everyone's interest -- investors in the third world included -- to make sure that doesn't happen? **********DAVID ELSILA **********Grosse Pointe Park, Mich., Aug. 4"

The downside is that there is a slim chance the CD player will play music in nearby cars, potentially leading to some ugly music-related road rage. **********The Emerson Research Personal CD Player attaches to speakers not with wires but by radio waves. It sends a signal to the car antenna, which in turns directs the signal to an unused frequency on the car's radio dial; the signal then is played through the car's speakers as if it were coming from a radio station. **********The only catch is that it is possible that the signal could be picked up by neighboring cars.

Nickerson, who made millions of dollars from real estate investments and millions more writing books telling others how to do the same thing, died on Oct. 19 at his home in Capitola, Calif. He was 91. **********Reflecting his strong religious beliefs as a lifelong Congregationalist, he gave away his entire estate to pay for student scholarships and professorships to divinity and religiously oriented schools that he considered ''ecumenically and pluralistically minded.'' **********These included Harvard Divinity School, Yale Divinity School, Piedmont College, Andover Newton Theological School, Union Theological Seminary, Chicago Theological Seminary, Colgate Rochester Divinity School and Pacific School of Religion. **********''How I Turned $1,000 Into a Million in Real Estate -- in My Spare Time'' became a famous book and a catchphrase in the 1960's and 1970's. It came out in 1959. In later editions the $1 million return became $5 million. The book was full of practical advice, typified by its first line, ''The road to riches is paved with borrowed money.'' **********Though the book, published by Simon & Schuster, has been out of print for decades, its influence persists, with reviews still posted by readers on the Amazon.com Web site. **********''I used this book to make several million dollars for myself, and taught two friends to use the book, and they also made substantial money,'' a man who identified himself as a Houston reader wrote this July. ''It shows you how real estate wealth is made, and shows you step by step how to do it yourself.'' **********Last December, Richard Pennant of Seattle, who said his hobby was reading real estate books, wrote, ''This is easily the most concise and informative tome on the subject of acquiring wealth through investing in real estate that I have ever read.'' **********Mr. Nickerson was born in Grants Pass, Ore., and graduated from high school in Fresno, Calif. He was captivated with the idea of adventure, partly to collect ideas for the books he planned to write, and he hiked from Fresno to Mount Ayr, Iowa, and back the summer after high school. **********He enrolled at Fresno State College, but left the next spring to work and hike his way around the world. He visited countries from Peru to Holland to Singapore, often traveling as a seaman on merchant ships. After three years of this itinerant life, he returned to Fresno State, where he graduated with a major in English and psychology. **********He then worked as a sales supervisor for a hosiery company for three years. He left to join the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company, where he worked for 17 years in sales, staff development and other areas. He bought a succession of houses starting in 1936. **********The first real estate book, the one aimed at only $1 million, was based largely on his own experience. In all, he wrote five books on real estate investment and two other books, ''My Odyssey Around Three Worlds'' and ''Did Jesus Die on the Cross?'' **********Mr. Nickerson was married for 61 years to the former Lucille Willis, who died in 1993. The next year, he married Margaret Noah, a longtime friend of the family. She, his son Robert, who lives in Antioch, Calif., and five grandchildren survive him."

The President was required under a 1998 law to certify that all such technology exports are in the national interest. **********The certification was the first such notice to Congress under the law, which was passed in the aftermath of a Congressional uproar last year over the transfer of sensitive missile technology to China. **********Mr. Clinton's notification also follows by less than a week the release of a report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which concluded that lax monitoring of the launching of American-made satellites aboard Chinese rockets had enhanced the accuracy of China's ballistic missile arsenal. **********And the action comes three days after the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was inadvertently bombed in a NATO raid, touching off angry street protests in Beijing. **********The President's action will affect  the June 7 launching of a Motorola Iridium satellite, which is to fly into low orbit to provide paging and cellular telephone service. Mr. Clinton said that he had approved the export of satellite fuel and explosive bolts, which eject the satellite from its launch vehicle. **********Today's action was the final approval needed for the launch, which was first authorized in July 1993. A license for the export of the satellite itself was granted in November. **********''The timing of this certification is not connected in any way to the tragic accident of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ''Approval was recommended by the Departments of Commerce, State and Defense and is consistent with our policy of supporting the launch of U.S. communications satellites by China subject to strong safeguards being in place.'' **********A staff member of the intelligence panel said it was unlikely to contest the approval of the technology. But he said questions might be raised over whether the explosive bolts might someday be used to help eject nuclear warheads from a missile."

They are depending on his protectors in Afghanistan to betray him -- a slim reed of hope for one of the biggest and most complicated international criminal investigations in American history. **********Capturing Mr. bin Laden alive could deepen the complications. American officials say that so far, firsthand evidence that could be used in court to prove that he commanded the bombings has proven difficult to obtain. According to the public record, none of the informants involved in the case have direct knowledge of Mr. bin Laden's involvement. **********For now, officials say, Federal prosecutors appear to be building a case that his violent words and ideas, broadcast from an Afghan cave, incited terrorist acts thousands of miles away. **********In their war against Mr. bin Laden, American officials portray him as the world's most dangerous terrorist. But reporters for The New York Times and the PBS program ''Frontline,'' working in cooperation, have found him to be less a commander of terrorists than an inspiration for them. **********Enemies and supporters, from members of the Saudi opposition to present and former American intelligence officials, say he may not be as globally powerful as some American officials have asserted. But his message and aims have more resonance among Muslims around the world than has been understood here. **********''You can kill Osama bin Laden today or tomorrow; you can arrest him and put him on trial in New York or in Washington,'' said Ahmed Sattar, an aide to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric convicted of inspiring the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. ''If this will end the problem -- no. Tomorrow you will get somebody else.'' **********Interviews with senior American officials and knowledgeable observers of Mr. bin Laden in Pakistan, Sudan and elsewhere suggest that there is widespread support among ordinary people in the Muslim world for his central political argument: that American troops should get out of Saudi Arabia. The embassy bombings, they note, took place eight years to the day after the G.I.'s were ordered onto Saudi soil. **********The interviews also raise questions about key assertions that have been made by the Government about Mr. bin Laden. Senior intelligence officials concede that their knowledge of him is sketchy. **********''We can't say for sure what was going on'' with him from 1991 to 1996 -- most of the years covered in the indictment -- one senior official said. **********His Affluence Seems Overstated **********Present and former American officials and former business associates of Mr. bin Laden say he appears to control only a fraction of the $250 million fortune that the American Government says he possesses. **********''Clearly, his money's running out,'' said Frank Anderson, a former senior Central Intelligence Agency official who maintains close Middle Eastern contacts. **********Larry Johnson, the State Department deputy counterterrorism director from 1988 to 1993, said Administration officials had ''tended to make Osama bin Laden sort of a Superman in Muslim garb -- he's 10 feet tall, he's everywhere, he knows everything, he's got lots of money and he can't be challenged.'' **********Milton Bearden, a retired senior C.I.A. official who ran the agency's war in Afghanistan and retired in 1995, said the Government had ''created a North Star'' in Mr. bin Laden. **********''He is public enemy No. 1,'' Mr. Bearden said. ''We've got a $5 million reward out for his head. And now we have, with I'm not sure what evidence, linked him to all of the terrorist acts of this year -- of this decade, perhaps.'' **********Political leaders in Sudan and Pakistan who have met Mr. bin Laden describe him as intelligent, soft-spoken, polite. They also say he is deadly serious about his violent brand of radical politics and capable of killing in God's name. **********Mr. bin Laden was born into the ruling class of Saudi Arabia. His father was the favorite construction magnate of the Saudi royal family, who gave Mr. bin Laden's family huge contracts to renovate the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and build palaces for Saudi princes. **********American officials calculated Mr. bin Laden's fortune by estimating the family fortune at $5 billion and dividing by 20, the number of male heirs. But business associates of Mr. bin Laden said his family cut him off years ago and are managing his share of his inheritance for him as long as he is disowned. Business associates say that Mr. bin Laden has been living on a generous allowance from his eldest brother and that his assets in Saudi Arabia are now frozen. **********In 1980, at 22, Mr. bin Laden left Saudi Arabia and moved to the Afghan frontier. In Peshawar, Pakistan -- working alongside, but never directly allied with, the C.I.A. -- he used his money and his machines to help the Afghan rebels fight the Soviet Army invaders. **********The Afghan war shaped Mr. bin Laden, those who know him say. ''He is an ordinary person who is very religious,'' said President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan, who met Mr. bin Laden often from 1992 to 1996. ''He believes in the rule of Islam and where possible the establishment of an Islamic state. The time that he spent in Afghanistan led him to believe that this might be achieved through military means.'' **********Legend has it that Mr. bin Laden fought bravely against Soviet troops. But former C.I.A. officers say he was a financier, not a warrior -- ''a philanthropist supporting a number of health care, widows-and-orphans charity operations in Peshawar for Afghan refugees,'' as Mr. Anderson put it. **********He also helped create a headquarters called Al Qaeda, the Base. It was a way station in Peshawar where Egyptian and Saudi volunteers rested before setting off for battle in Afghanistan. Its name became a kind of flag uniting Mr. bin Laden's followers. American officials call it a global terrorist network. **********When the Soviet forces left Afghanistan in 1989, Mr. bin Laden went home to Saudi Arabia. He soon set his sights on the last remaining superpower. **********''He himself was very much wary about America,'' said Saad al-Faqih, a Saudi exile living in London, who worked as a surgeon for wounded Afghan fighters, ''very skeptical about America and the Saudi regime.'' **********He found a new enemy on Aug. 7, 1990, when the United States began sending half a million soldiers to Saudi Arabia, preparing for war against Iraq. **********''One of the stories put out by bin Laden is that he went to King Fahd and promised that he would raise holy warriors who would protect Saudi Arabia,'' said Mr. Anderson, who was the chief of the C.I.A.'s Near East operations in the mid-1990's. ''His violent opposition to the Saudi royal family began when King Fahd denied or rejected that offer.'' **********Americans Painted As New Crusaders **********To Mr. bin Laden the deployment of Americans in the land of Mecca and Medina smacked of the Crusades, the Christian religious wars against Islam that began nine centuries ago. His rage transformed him into a stateless outlaw. **********In November 1991, Saudi intelligence officers caught Mr. bin Laden smuggling weapons from Yemen, his father's homeland. They withdrew his passport. Soon afterward he made his way to Sudan, which had decreed its borders open to all Muslims, with or without passports or visas. **********Veterans of the Afghan jihad, or holy war, against Moscow followed Mr. bin Laden, under Al Qaeda's banner. But ''when Al Qaeda was moved to Sudan, it lost around 70 percent of its members,'' Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, accused of being an associate of Mr. bin Laden, said during an interrogation by the German police after his arrest in September. **********''This group didn't have a purpose except to carry out the jihad,'' Mr. Salim said, ''and since nobody carried out the jihad, it lost a lot of its members.'' **********He Lived As an Investor **********There were three kinds of men in Al Qaeda, he said. First, ''people who had no success in life, had nothing in their heads and wanted to join just to keep from falling on their noses.'' Second, ''people who loved their religion but had no idea what their religion really meant.'' And third, ''people who have nothing in their heads but to fight and solve all the problems in the world with battles.'' **********Mr. bin Laden lived in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, ''as an investor,'' said President Bashir. ''With his money, he was adventurous, and probably he gained this mentality by his experiences as a fighter.'' **********The indictment against Mr. bin Laden says he provided training camps in Sudan where Afghan war veterans prepared for terrorist missions. But a senior American intelligence official contradicted that, saying, ''There was never a bin Laden-financed training camp in Sudan.'' **********The official added: ''In 1993, '94, '95, he's managing and building up his legitimate business presence there in Sudan. I won't pretend we've got a good intelligence base on this period, but we think he was laying the groundwork for Al Qaeda.'' **********In 1995 two C.I.A. officers were stalked by teen-age followers of Mr. bin Laden in the streets of Khartoum. ''Bin Laden was approached by us and was told that this would not be tolerated,'' said Ghazi Salaheldin, the Sudanese Information Minister. Sudan expelled the teen-agers. **********In the face of such perceived threats -- though some were mirages, based on a slew of false C.I.A. reports -- the United States withdrew from Sudan in late 1995. The absence of American diplomats and spies in the country diminished Washington's ability to know what Mr. bin Laden was doing at the very moment he stepped up his political war. **********In 1995, after the Saudi Government rescinded his citizenship, he began sending scathing attacks on the royal family from Khartoum. **********''Bin Laden took a chance and started doing some political activities,'' President Bashir said, ''not terrorist activities, but he started issuing political bulletins and communiques and faxes'' denouncing the Saudi Government as corrupt and repressive. **********The United States took notice. ''There had been confusion'' after the World Trade Center bombing about the nature of radical Islamic threats to the United States, said Mr. Johnson, the former senior counterterrorism official. **********No Evidence To Implicate Him **********''There were lots of theories, not very good intelligence, and so the intelligence community actually started generating a picture that Osama bin Laden was, if you will, the new face of terrorism,'' he said. **********On May 31, 1996, four Saudis were beheaded after confessing to bombing a Saudi National Guard post in Riyadh and killing five Americans. All told their interrogators that they had received Mr. bin Laden's communiques. Only 25 days later, a truck bomb tore through a military post in Dhahran, killing 19 American soldiers. **********Mr. bin Laden was blamed by American officials for instigating the attacks. But no known evidence implicates him, and the Saudi Interior Minister, Prince Nayef ibn Abdel Aziz, has absolved him. ''Maybe there are people who adopt his ideas,'' Prince Nayef said. ''He does not constitute any security problem to us.'' **********Shortly before the Dhahran attack, Mr. bin Laden and members of his entourage left Sudan in a C-130 military transport plane. The Sudanese had asked him to leave -- at the request of the United States. Mr. bin Laden landed at an American-built airport in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Three months later, on Aug. 23, 1996, he declared war on the United States. **********''The situation in Saudi Arabia is like a great volcano about to erupt,'' his declaration stated. ''Everyone talks openly about economic recession, high prices, debt'' and ''the filling up of the prisons.'' **********How Did He Control the Bombers? **********Mr. bin Laden's criticisms of Saudi repression and corruption closely corresponded with State Department reports and C.I.A. analyses. But Mr. bin Laden blamed the United States. ''The root of the problem is the occupying American enemy,'' he proclaimed, ''and all efforts should focus on killing, fighting and destroying it.'' **********A second, more ominous warning from him came on Feb. 23, 1998: ''To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country where this is possible,'' until American armies, ''shattered and broken-winged, depart from all the lands of Islam.'' **********Then came the embassy bombings last August. American authorities say the men who attacked the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were controlled by Mr. bin Laden. But they still have no clear idea how. **********Despite efforts at the highest levels of the United States Government, Mr. bin Laden and his closest associates remain isolated in Afghanistan. **********It is difficult to say precisely where the criminal case against Mr. bin Laden stands. Prosecutors have obtained unusually restrictive court orders that bar the defendants and their lawyers from communicating with virtually anyone. **********The Case Runs Out of Steam **********Publicly, at least, the case has lost momentum. While two men suspected of being bombers were quickly apprehended, many other suspects are still at large. The last arrest was more than six months ago. A spokesman for the United States Attorney in Manhattan declined comment. **********Now the hunt for Mr. bin Laden depends on whether the Taliban, his radical hosts in Afghanistan, will betray him. The United States has little leverage with the Taliban, and little fresh intelligence on how to capture Mr. bin Laden. It has no spies in Afghanistan and little new information on precisely how he might have instigated the deadly bombings. **********''I do not have a clear picture yet of what happened when,'' said Prudence Bushnell, the United States Ambassador to Kenya, who was wounded in the bomb blast, which killed 12 of her colleagues. ''I may not ever have a clear picture of what happened when. None of us may.'' **********A COLLABORATION **********This article resulted from a collaboration between The New York Times and the PBS program ''Frontline,'' which will broadcast a documentary tonight about Osama bin Laden that will run on most PBS stations at 9 o'clock. The ''Frontline'' program was based on the work of Lowell Bergman, correspondent, Martin Smith, producer, and Orianna Zill and Ivana Damjanov, associate producers. **********ON THE WEB **********Past coverage of Mr. bin Laden, the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in East Africa and the American response to terrorism is available from The New York Times on the Web: **********www.nytimes.com/ international"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/05/business/investing-is-the-party-ending-2-views-in-europe.html,Alan Cowell,1999-12-05,,874,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Is the Party Ending? 2 Views in Europe,INVESTING; Is the Party Ending? 2 Views in Europe," **********AS the euro hovers at virtual parity with dollar, European fund managers and equity strategists are engaged in a  great stock-market debate: Is Europe looking at a glass half full, or one brimming with frothy valuations? **********Almost a year after the common currency's introduction, there is a large degree of unanimity between Europe's bulls and bears. Both groups see that cultural changes in Continental Europeans' attitudes toward investment have begun pushing money out of low-earning bank deposits and into mutual funds. And they agree that Europe's merger frenzy is unlikely to abate. **********They also know that Europe's markets, especially in the last two months, have been driven by a surge in technology and telecommunications stocks, raising hopes among the bulls that Europe's technology sector is where America's was a few years back -- poised for explosive growth. **********In local currencies, the British FTSE-100 index is up 14.6 percent so far this year, while the French CAC-40 index is up 38.7 percent. Other gains include 22.3 percent for the DAX index in Germany and 5.6 percent for the Milan MIB 30 in Italy. For American investors, of course, the euro's weakness has cut into those returns. **********But some do not believe that the future will be as profitable as the recent past. As is the case in the United States, positive performances mask a fairly narrow bull market. Only about one-third of Europe's top 300 stocks have outperformed expectations, while most of the rest have languished. **********''The market has all its eggs in one basket,'' said David Bowers, an equity strategist at Merrill Lynch. **********There is also the worry that there is not enough uninvested money to sustain a market rise. ''Cash has all been put to work. There is little to defend the markets if they start to fall,'' said Adrian Holmes, who manages $3 billion at the Merrill Lynch Eurofund and is worried about the speed of stocks' gains this fall. ''There has been a trough-to-peak in six weeks or two months, and I have never seen such a ludicrous move in my entire investment career.'' **********This, Mr. Holmes said, is cause for concern. ''Fundamentally, I think the markets are too high and technically too extended,'' he said. ''My guess is that the markets will go down and go down reasonably sharply.'' **********The problem, he said, is that people ''have given up on looking at valuations.'' Indeed, the price-to-earnings multiples on the FTSE-100 and CAC-40, at 29 and 30, respectively, are just a bit lower than that of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The P/ E's on the DAX and MIB 30 are higher. **********CONTRAST that view, though, with the assessment of Mark Howdle, chief European equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney here. He thinks the market is set to broaden, driven in part by liquidity. ''Telecommunications and technology will be the froth on a rising market'' for the next three to six months, he said. ''When we hit the glass ceiling and realize that the market isn't going any higher for a few months, people will want to sell off and rotate into safer havens for a while. I don't think they are clearly overvalued yet.'' **********Various factors have maintained the demand. According to Mr. Howdle, some $8 billion a month has been flowing into European equity mutual funds since the beginning of the year. And international investors who had shied from European markets earlier are beginning to return. While American investors represent only a relatively small part of the market, said Mr. Holmes at Merrill Lynch, they exercise a ''disproportionate influence'' on prices because they pursue more active management than some of their European counterparts. **********But other experts think it is European demand that will push stocks higher. The flow of new money into European pension  and mutual funds is set to increase to $500 billion next year from $400 billion this year.  ''It's about Europeans learning about equities on a scale we have never seen before,'' said Michael J. Browne, head of European equities at Chase Global Asset Management, who is particularly bullish. ''I think we are one year into the returns you have seen in the U.S. market in the last three, four, five years,'' he said. **********Specifically, he predicted that shares of Nokia, the Finnish cell phone company,  would be around 200 euros in 12 months, versus 154 on Friday, while Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, would hit 550 kronor, versus 475.5 on Friday. **********Other telecommunications and related stocks -- Sonera in Finland, Bouygues and Vivendi in France and Mannesmann in Germany -- will keep rising, he said, largely because of Europe's lead over the United States in the wireless business. **********Of course, the risks are familiar. ''An unexpected shock from Wall Street'' could upset all of Europe's calculations, said Mr. Bowers, the Merrill Lynch strategist. **********And, nobody seems sure where the euro will go next. The currency started the year at $1.18 but last week it dipped briefly -- and for the first time -- below the psychologically important parity level with the dollar. But that weakness may serve investors' interests. ''We take the view that it's going to strengthen next year,'' said Mr. Howdle of Salomon. That means the current price offers a nice buying level for non-European investors to pick up European assets."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/21/technology/computers-are-the-balanchine-behind-those-dancing-fountains.html,Verne Kopytoff,1999-10-21,"Computers have help transform some fountains from simply marble statues with spouts into events that feature fire, lights. fog, music and increasingly sophisticated liquid acrobatics; some interesting computer-controlled fountains in Las Vegas, Ne...",1048,,The New York Times,Technology,News,article,Computers Are the Balanchine Behind Those Dancing Fountains,Computers Are the Balanchine Behind Those Dancing Fountains," **********PEOPLE standing in front of the Bellagio casino here appeared to forget about winning a jackpot as soon as the fountain in the resort's lake began dancing to Lionel Richie's song, ''All Night Long.'' **********Hundreds of water columns swayed to the beat, creating graceful arcs and pirouettes that were illuminated by floodlights. The streams intensified with the music until the water shot 20 stories high, like a row of giant exclamation points along half a block of the Las Vegas Strip. **********''It's the classiest show on the Strip,'' said Jenine Cali, a rock musician from Las Vegas who watched the fountain in action on an October evening, waving her arms as if conducting a symphony. She joined the hundreds of other spectators around the lake in applauding once the show was over. ''It's very spiritual,'' she said. ''It puts me in a trance.'' **********Fountains are no longer simply marble statues with spouts. Assisted by technology, fountains now feature fire, lights, fog, music and increasingly sophisticated liquid acrobatics. **********Only computers can act quickly enough to operate dozens of water nozzles and other embellishments at the same time. They are programmed to open and close fountain valves in a variety of combinations to make performances as different as a dribble of water is different from a geyser. **********''Technology is just as important to a fountain as steel is to a building,'' said Mark Fuller, chairman and founder of Wet Design, a company based in Universal City, Calif., that designed Bellagio's fountain. **********That was not always the case. For centuries, fountains had controls no more complicated than gravity and water pressure. **********With computers, fountains can be choreographed to spray in a variety of heights and patterns. All the computer must do is issue a different set of instructions. **********For example, some nozzles can shoot tall streams while others barely gurgle. Then the nozzles can suddenly reverse roles, fire randomly or shoot rapidly around a circle in what is called a chase. **********Hugh F. Hughes, director of business development for the fountain-building division of Valley Crest, a landscaping company based in Anaheim, Calif., said that computers also allowed fountains to be controlled in intervals of less than a second. That way, fountains can spray in rapid succession small streams of water that collide in the air with a splash. **********Updating fountains with new performances is another job that is considered to be easier with computers. Rather than using a wrench and screwdriver to make a fountain do new things, designers can simply add a computer program. **********''When the client says, 'We've seen these four or five shows, can my fountain do anything else?' we say yes,'' Mr. Hughes said. **********Valley Crest often builds fountains with computers about the size of an encyclopedia that usually operate outdoor lighting systems. Such fountains operate on automatic pilot and can feature dozens of nozzles programmed to perform a variety of water gymnastics. **********The fountain at Bellagio, the $1.6 billion casino opened in October 1998 by Mirage Resorts and designed by its chief executive, Stephen A. Wynn, is of another order altogether. Considered to be among the largest and most sophisticated in the world, it opened at a cost of $40 million. It has 1,203 nozzles and 4,500 lights spread across 860 feet of an eight-acre faux Alpine lake. **********About the only thing it doesn't have is fire, which some fountains include. The only one in the United States, another one of Wet Design's products, was built at the Viejas Springs casino near San Diego. It spews flames while it sprays water, creating what looks like burning water. Natural gas is released into the water and then lighted -- but only after the maintenance system's approval and only if the fountain's human operator is pressing an all-clear button at the proper moment. **********Even without fire, choreographing Bellagio's fountain took more than two months.  The performance of each nozzle and light had to be individually programmed for the duration of nearly a dozen songs. **********''To do it the traditional way of turning knobs and typing things in would take the proverbial thousand monkeys a thousand years,'' said Mr. Fuller, from Wet Design. **********The fountain's brains are in a couple of unremarkable looking boxes filled with electronics that sit in eight-foot-tall glass cabinets in a tower behind the lake. Called spoolers, these devices are actually special computers that can quickly issue a large number of commands. **********Many of these instructions are transmitted to giant equipment rooms underneath the hotel, where the fountain's machinery hums so loud that visitors must wear ear protection. The rooms are filled with large air pumps that send the fountain's water surging in the air and huge cabinets filled with electronic wiring and relays. **********Next to the spoolers is the fountain's electronic maintenance monitoring system.  It checks the fountain's hardware 30 times a second to make sure that nothing breaks. If something does break, the monitoring system turns everything off and warns human operators of the problems. **********Adjoining cabinets contain separate controls for the audio and hotel facade lighting.  The computerized music system pumps out sound to the nearly 200 speakers around the lake while the lighting system dims the lamps in front of the hotel just before fountain performances begin. **********Unlike most fountains, the control system at Bellagio is backed up by a human, who is in charge of pressing the start button before every show. Putting the fountain on automatic pilot is considered too risky. **********Someone must be there in case equipment malfunctions and to watch the lake for straggling maintenance workers and spectators foolish enough to go for a swim. The water from the fountain is expelled at such high pressure -- up to 250 pounds per square inch -- that anyone caught in the line of fire could be injured. **********On an autumn evening, Scott O'Connor operated the fountain at Bellagio. He  pressed the fountain's green start button, and within seconds water salvos were jumping nearly 200 feet in the air to the rhythm of Frank Sinatra singing ''Luck Be a Lady.''  When he saw through binoculars that the spray was drenching the restaurant, he told the computer to reduce the fountain's height. **********''This is the most violent, most impressive show we have,'' Mr. O'Connor said before looking through his binoculars for angry faces on the restaurant patio. A bit relieved, he added, ''No one's jumping.''"

When a storm is bearing down on the airport and waiting until the last minute would be likely to force the delay or cancellation of a flight. **********That happened on at least one US Airways flight from Milwaukee on Aug. 12, when a storm was rapidly approaching and the airline's public address system warned a passenger who had already checked in to board immediately so the plane could depart ahead of the storm. **********US Airways, Delta Air Lines and the American Airlines unit of AMR acknowledged that they had occassionally left early, either to avoid storms or when all ticketed passengers were in their seats -- but only after an early departure was approved by the captain, air traffic control, the dispatcher, customer service, meteorologists and other flight officials, though such early departures are rare. **********Airline Bargains **********To celebrate its new nonstop service between Atlanta and Vienna, Austrian Airlines is offering $340 round-trip fares from Atlanta to six Austrian cities: Vienna, Innsbruck, Salzburg, Linz, Klagenfurt and Graz. It is also offering $440 round trips to those same cities from nine other cities in the United States, including Dallas, Miami, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Tampa, Fla. The nonrefundable tickets must be bought by Sept. 24 for departures between Oct. 1 and Dec. 7, with travel completed by Dec. 18.  Other restrictions apply. **********British Airways has added beds that recline fully to a length of 6 feet 6 inches on its daily nonstop flights between Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Gatwick Airport outside London. Pillows and pajamas are included. **********Yesterday, Airtran added a fifth daily nonstop between its Atlanta hub and Philadelphia. Year-to-date, Airtran has flown 5.8 percent more passengers than in the corresponding period last year. **********Singapore Airlines has joined Hyatt Hotels' frequent-flier program. Each stay at a Hyatt is good for 500 frequent-flier miles on the airline, but through Nov. 14, Singapore members who stay at participating Hyatt International hotels in more than 30 countries outside the United States, Canada and the Caribbean will get 1,000 miles for each stay. **********Other Airline Business **********Several airlines are adding new destinations or flights, some of them seasonal. Northwest Airlines, for example, is adding a new daily Detroit-Honolulu nonstop between Dec. 17 and April 1, 1999. **********On Oct. 18, Air Canada will begin daily nonstop service between Dulles International Airport, serving Washington, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. To promote the flight, the airline is offering round-trip fares starting at $179 for sale until Sept. 29 and valid for travel until Dec. 18. **********Next April 13, US Airways will begin daily nonstop flights between Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in North Carolina and Paris, and on May 19 will begin a daily nonstop between Charlotte and Frankfurt. On May 26, US Airways will add a daily nonstop between Philadelphia and Manchester, England. **********Airports **********Charlotte/Douglas still has comfortable oak rocking chairs in its atrium and has no intention of removing them. Installed in 1997 to promote a photo exhibition of Southern porches, the chairs were being taken away at the end of the exhibit until passengers complained, whereupon they were promptly returned.  Unlike the typical airport seat, the rocking chairs can also be bought at the airport for $225 plus shipping."

But combined, they hold just 15 percent of the market share, and face an expanding list of competitors ranging from giant warehouse clubs to computer stores, all offering similar products. **********Against this backdrop, the leader, Office Depot, is making a big advertising push with a new creative approach that uses humor to promote the idea that it offers helpful business solutions and low prices. **********The new campaign -- the first from DeVito/Verdi in New York -- will compete with the funny, award-winning advertising by Staples, its  chief rival and former merger partner. A merger agreement between Staples and Office Depot was killed in July 1997 when the Federal Trade Commission rejected it on antitrust grounds. **********''People are shopping for office products in an extraordinary broad range of retailers,'' said Tom Cross, Office Depot's senior vice president of marketing and advertising, in Delray Beach, Fla. ''It's a huge market out there with lots of room for growth.'' **********Office Depot began introducing its estimated $40-million-plus advertising campaign over the weekend with four network and spot television commercials that each end with the tag line ''Low prices every day.'' **********The advertising is aiming at the ''SOHO market,'' Mr. Cross said -- a common acronym in the office business, not for the trendy Manhattan neighborhood south of Houston Street, but for the small office/home office market. **********That market, important for all office product retailers, is growing about 5 percent annually with the increase in small businesses, telecommuting and independent home offices. The Michigan Small Business Development Center estimates that a home-based business starts every 11 seconds in the United States. **********According to the Business Products Industry Association, about 80 percent of the superstores' sales is in the small office and home office market. **********The commercials are direct, with an almost newsy quality, like one  opening with an attractive 60-ish couple sailing in what appears to be a retirement spot. Then an announcer  explains that the couple is free of financial worry ''all because you left your credit receipt in the wastebasket and they stole it.'' **********The point: ''Prevent credit card theft with a paper shredder,'' which then appears on screen. **********In another commercial, a worker shows a frustrated colleague how to make his computer go faster by tossing it out the window. The spot ends by promising that Office Depot has ''the latest computers at the fastest speed.'' **********In a third commercial, shocked employees are standing outside a supply room, listening to an attractive chief financial officer inside the room with her clerk ''oohing'' and ''aahing'' -- about great prices. **********''If saving money is what gets you excited, go to Office Depot,'' the spot urges. **********Though the commercial is suggestive, said Ellis Verdi, president at DeVito/Verdi, he does not consider it risque because ''we're all in on the joke.'' **********Office Depot has always used humor in its advertising; a campaign from its previous agency, Wyse Advertising in Cleveland, featured the cartoon character Dilbert. This time, Mr. Cross said, the humor is used strategically and informs viewers. **********''So much of advertising doesn't  provide new information,'' he added, ''and we feel strongly that our advertising should.'' **********The new Office Depot campaign has its work cut out in trying to capture attention in the category. The advertising for Staples by Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York, part of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C., is largely credited with bringing creativity to the industry's pitches with a clever campaign, introduced in 1995, carrying the theme ''Yeah, we've got that.'' Those ads have won virtually all the top advertising awards and continue to run today. **********In fact, Staples plans to introduce another commercial in the campaign next Monday, said Dwight Garland,  vice president for advertising in Westborough, Mass. The spot is also aimed at the small office and home office market, he added. **********The new Staples spot presents a refugee from corporate life who drives up a mountain, triumphantly shedding his tie, briefcase and other shackles of the business world. On the other side of the mountain, meanwhile, the liberated man's shoe hits a hiker, who says, ''Wingtip.'' **********The spot ''shows that we understand our target customer,'' Mr. Garland said, who is ''individualistic, self-motivated.'' **********Meantime, Officemax will continue its ''Stickmax'' stick-figure advertising this year, created in-house, which offers a ''155%'' low-price guarantee, said Steve Baisden, a spokesman in Shaker Heights, Ohio. **********All three superstore chains are opening stores and spending heavily to advertise in an industry that was barely promoted a decade ago. For the 10 months through October, they spent $162.5 million in advertising, compared with $146.3 million in the corresponding period in 1997, according to Competitive Media Reporting in New York, a unit of VNU N.V. that tracks ad spending. **********Staples led with $60.4 million for the 1998 period, followed by Office Depot at $55.6 million and Officemax at $46.5 million."

But they refused to predict the size of the final repair bill or spell out how it would be divided. **********''The real standard of living is higher than the statistics would indicate,'' Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European Commission's head of financial and monetary affairs, said. ''The damage to infrastructure is less than expected.'' **********That optimism was cautiously supported by the new United States Treasury Secretary, Lawrence Summers, and James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank. The officials spoke as a new steering group assembled to address the issue. **********European nations are generally expected to take over the biggest costs of rebuilding Kosovo and  helping neighbors like Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro and Romania recover from the Kosovo conflict. Finance Minister Hans Eichel of Germany  said on Monday that the European nations anticipated spending no more than $500 million this year on Kosovo aid. A donors' conference is set for July 28 in Sarajevo, Bosnia. **********European leaders have said they do not want to increase their total foreign aid budgets, prompting World Bank officials to worry that other countries in dire straits would be shortchanged. **********The meeting today was the first formal attempt by Western countries and international institutions to plan for Balkan reconstruction. The steering group includes the finance ministers from the seven major industrialized countries, as well as officials from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. **********Since the war ended four weeks ago, American officials have said that European nations should take the main responsibility for reconstruction because American planes provided most of the NATO firepower in the bombing. **********European leaders have agreed with that in principle. But Mr. Silguy said today that reliable assessments might take months to complete. **********Officials here said cities like Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, were in considerably better shape than they had expected. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of houses have been destroyed, most of them owned by Kosovo Albanians and demolished by Serbian troops. **********The president of the European Investment Bank, Sir Brian Unwin, said the infrastructure remained in surprisingly good shape, adding, ''I don't think the basic infrastructure damage in Kosovo itself is excessive.'' **********Mr. Summers said the fact that the war ended when it did might have helped. **********The list of needs is formidable -- a reliable banking and payment system; laws to enforce contracts, a prerequisite for building confidence among foreign investors, and a ''currency arrangement'' independent from the Yugoslav dinar."

And at this defining moment, all parties would do well to step back and meditate upon a much larger issue that the trial has raised. **********That issue is not whether Microsoft should be divided and conquered, nor whether it will be granted the freedom to choose whether to add an Internet browser or other features to its Windows operating system. **********Much more crucial is a clear comprehension by all parties about the nature of software itself, about its growing influence on global society and about if -- and how -- that influence should be curbed by governments or any outside authority. **********After a judge issued his findings of fact last month, most consumers interviewed for news articles and surveys seemed to like Microsoft just fine. Lack of choice aside, they seemed to think that software was just another thing to buy, like music CD's or the season's latest fashion. **********But such a view is naive at best. Though software is marketed like discrete packaged goods, it is most certainly not just another product, slightly more difficult to master than walking in platform shoes. Its influence on our lives is pervasive and often so subtle as to be invisible. It is much more powerful than most of us want to acknowledge. **********When personal computers entered the consumer market in the early 1980's, for example, even those of us who embraced them thought that the software programs we used were far too coercive in the way they made us change the very nature of our work habits. And it is still true today that software -- written by a team of sleep-deprived programmers in some fusty cubicle -- is the code that lays down the absolute law by which we live our digital lives. We are not free to change that code; our choice is to love it or leave it. **********In the Microsoft trial -- the company's abuses of market dominance aside -- the battle is really over whose law is to be sovereign, software's or the government's. Of course, there is no clear or easy answer. **********In a new book about the relationship between software and law, a leading constitutional scholar argues that as far as technology is concerned, we have been dangerously indulgent, corrupt and irresponsible. Our best option now, he says, is to do no more harm and try to puzzle through the problem before we do any lasting damage to either the free market or the constitution. **********The scholar is Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard law professor who was recently asked to submit a friend-of-the-court brief in the Microsoft case by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. His book is titled ''Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace'' (Basic Books). **********Although Mr. Lessig's book does not directly address the Microsoft case, he builds a cogent argument that cyberspace is already regulated by software code, which by its nature decides whether and under what circumstances we will have privacy or anonymity and who can or cannot have access and how. **********Though this fact was not so terrifying when the software running the global Internet was built on open standards, the situation has become significantly more ominous as the code has become commercialized and thus private and not open to public scrutiny. And despite the freewheeling and libertarian nature of the Internet, Mr. Lessig says, when commercial code begins to determine the Internet's architecture, it creates a kind of privatized law that must be regulated if the public interest and public values are to be democratically represented. **********How to regulate it -- how even to think about it -- is the question that must be answered. And, he writes, ''at exactly the time when the most significant decisions must be made about what cyberspace will become, we do not have the institutions or the experience to handle them.'' **********A settlement that does not consider these issues strikes terror in the heart of some of Microsoft's competitors, who see what might happen if the government agrees to Microsoft's demand that it must be able to innovate, whatever the social costs. **********For example, shortly after the original findings of fact were made public, Jean-Louis Gassee, the chairman of Be Inc., an operating systems company, posted a column -- ''All Pros and No Cons? It's a Con.''-- on his company's Web site (www.be.com). ''When I hear Microsoft's carefully orchestrated refrain -- all we ask is the freedom to innovate, we'll never renounce our freedom to innovate -- being sung by top executives and paid consultants,'' Mr. Gassee wrote, ''I wonder, do they really believe this? Or is it a calculated bet on what our emotional response to an appeal to higher principles will be?'' **********In fact, Mr. Gassee believes that Microsoft is strident about innovation because linking the Windows operating system with Microsoft's Web browser is how the software giant can gain proprietary control over Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, the basic code of the Internet. **********By tying its browser to Windows, which is likely to remain dominant for years no matter what the outcome of the government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, Microsoft can create software modules or plug-ins that can only be read by a merged Windows-Explorer operating system. **********This coerces both Web site designers and users to either continue to buy Microsoft's operating system upgrades or lose the ability to function fully on the Internet. **********Mr. Lessig holds that these commercial software architectures are what now dominate cyberspace. They are private and ''therefore traditionally outside the scope'' of constitutional review. Which is just the way the software industry wants it. **********''When government steps aside, it is not as if nothing takes its place,'' he writes. Certainly private interests ''have ends they wish to pursue,'' he continues, adding: ''Do we know what those interests are? Are we so certain they are better?'' **********Especially today, this focus on public versus private interest moves the debate far outside questions of innovation or the primacy of the market -- unless, of course, we are willing to cede our Constitution to unchecked market forces. **********Even as selfish and shortsighted as we have become, this is probably not yet the case. And though Mr. Lessig writes, somewhat darkly, that ''we confront this moment of extraordinary importance incapable of making any useful decisions,'' this is also the moment to acknowledge that software code is in fact its own regulatory regime, competing with the law. **********Those now charged with deciding Microsoft's fate may want to understand this first, before deciding which regime's rules should prevail."

''Atis is Golf,'' the controller, Christopher P. Cole, said, touching one box on the screen, which suddenly showed the letter ''G.''  ''S.I.D. Bulls,'' he said, touching another, which filled with a ''B.'' **********Barking acronyms into the microphone is standard procedure in control towers. But entering crucial information by touch-screen computer instead of using color-coded ballpoint pens on paper strips is unique to this tower, and part of a bold new experiment in air traffic control that is drawing increasing interest from the United States. **********The interest -- from officials at United States airlines, the American controllers' union and the Federal Aviation Administration, among others -- is not so much in the specific technology. It is mostly in Mr. Cole's new employer, Nav Canada, the only private company in the world to run a national air traffic control system, and in the new techniques the company is using to bring computers and software into service. **********The Clinton Administration has repeatedly tried to tinker with the structure of the F.A.A., and three years ago freed the agency from many Federal constraints on personnel and procurement policy. Last year, the Administration proposed making the F.A.A. a ''performance-based organization'' like the Patent and Trademark Office, which sets its own fees and controls its revenues, but Congress did not agree. Members of Congress enjoy their leverage over the F.A.A., bringing home bacon to their constituents in the form of instrument landing systems, new runways and the like. **********Many critics say that as Congress has organized it, the agency simply cannot cope with air traffic. **********Canada, by contrast, got radical. In 1996, Transport Canada, the Government agency that had run the air traffic system for decades, sold it to a nonprofit company created by Parliament whose directors represent airlines, general aviation, unionized workers and the public. **********Most constituencies think the new arrangement is going well, though controllers are having some second thoughts. **********When the idea was introduced, controllers, who had endured a wage freeze for years, were eager to become employees of a private company. Airlines, upset at delays and at the Government's use of taxes collected on air fares for nonaviation purposes, were also ready for change. And Transport Canada was running late and over budget on its huge modernization project -- the Canadian Automated Air Traffic System, or Caats -- which threatened to collapse, as a similar system did in the United States in the early 1990's. **********''It was a good move,'' said J. Clifford Mackay, president and chief executive of the Air Transport Association of Canada, the airline trade group. The system is financed by fees charged to planes, based mostly on weight and distance flown. Rates have gone down because Nav Canada cut the payroll to 5,200 people from 6,300, mostly by laying off administrative workers. Controllers agreed to work an extra two hours a week and give more flexibility in shift scheduling; in exchange they got big pay increases, ranging from 17 percent to nearly 40 percent, keyed to the difficulty of their jobs. **********The airlines say delays have been reduced. And managers who were in the system when it was run by Transport Canada say it is now safer because regulation, still done by Transport Canada, is now independent of operations. **********''We need look no further than Canada to see the benefits of privatized air traffic control,'' said Robert A. Crandall, the retired chairman of American Airlines, in a recent speech on the problems of the American system. A private agency, he said, has the ''built-in incentive to spend the capital necessary to stay ahead of the technological curve.'' **********There have been missteps, including an overestimation of the efficiencies that privatization would allow; the number of controllers in training was cut, inducing a shortage. To its credit, Mr. Mackay said, the company has shown great agility in recognizing and reversing the process with an aggressive training and recruitment program. **********The controllers' union, the Canadian Air Traffic Controllers Association, says it is reserving judgment on Nav Canada. Controllers are happy with the pay increases but say that management has become tougher. The union's president, Fazal Bhimji, said the number of grievances in arbitration had jumped to 80 this year from 14 in 1998, adding that controllers had hoped for a more collaborative system. ''Fifty-four percent voted in favor of privatization, but if we had the vote today, I'm not sure it would go through,'' he said. **********But even Mr. Bhimji is impressed with the new technology, a key area that has been a longtime weakness for Transport Canada and the F.A.A. While the Canadian Automated Air Traffic System is still not finished, completion appears close, thanks in part to some discipline practiced by Nav Canada. **********Canada's problems with new technology have close parallels with America's. Both countries have found that extensive delays in bringing in new computers have left them stuck with radar display screens that are too old to keep running. But Nav Canada appears to have pulled a technological rabbit out of a hat, developing a software patch so it can use new screens with the old mainframe computers. The job was done by just five programmers, in 16 months, allowing use of a screen with color, better resolution and new features. Similar projects in the United States involve scores or even hundreds of programmers, with less impressive results. In fact, a parallel American project developed a system that could not handle high traffic levels. **********Nav Canada, which can hire quickly and pay competitively, did the job in-house, something the F.A.A. cannot do. And managers at the company say they ignored Government contracting procedures. **********''Don't tell me you have to write a document 300 pages long and put it in the record before you can do something,'' said Sidney Koslow, Nav Canada's vice president for engineering. Mr. Koslow, who worked for years for an F.A.A. contractor, said Nav Canada's ''just get it done'' philosophy made much more sense than the F.A.A.'s approach. **********That attitude is also helping to finish Caats, he said. The Government wanted not only to put a modern air traffic control system in place for Canada, but also to nurture a software industry that could make products for export. Nav Canada left that aside. **********Extricating air traffic control from politics has had other benefits. The company cut overhead partly by compressing six regional offices into two and eliminating duplicate functions. That would have made sense under the old regime, too, said John W. Crichton, the president and chief executive, but never would have happened. **********Jane Garvey, the administrator of the F.A.A., said she had had extensive discussions with Mr. Crichton, Mr. Bhimji and others in Canada, as well as with officials in other countries that have established their air traffic systems as quasi-independent government agencies. She expressed interest in the cost-accounting system that allows Nav Canada to charge by the flight. The F.A.A. had tried to charge foreign airlines for flights over the United States, but a court blocked the charges last year, ruling that the agency had no basis for setting them. **********Ms. Garvey said that such a predictable revenue stream and the ability to pay competitively, two hallmarks of the Canadian system, would be useful in the United States. **********Nav Canada has another advantage, she said: the ability to pay competitively and thus fully staff its executive suite. (Top officials at Nav Canada are paid triple what top Canadian Government bureaucrats get; with boom times for airlines in recent years, the F.A.A. has had numerous vacancies.) **********Except at the top, the new Canadian system is run mostly by the people who ran the old one, mostly in the same jobs. But, managers say, the atmosphere is different than it used to be. **********''A dollar saved by the airline is now considered a dollar saved by Nav Canada,'' said Joel J. Morin, manager of Nav Canada's Air Traffic Simulation Center, adjacent to the Ottawa airport. The company, he said, sought to run the system for the benefit of the users, instead of the convenience of the Government. He showed off a new computer system that was replaying a day's traffic at Dorval Airport in Montreal at 200 times normal speed. **********The system helped reorganize the whole country's air traffic routes to reduce congestion and the need for controller instructions to planes. It is now being used to estimate how much shorter certain plane routes would be if Nav Canada added several radars in the Arctic and opened routes over the pole to flights bound for Asia. Nav Canada is thus a rare bird, seeking more traffic. **********Transport Canada, where he worked for years, would never have bothered doing such an analysis, Mr. Morin said, because there was no obvious benefit to the Government. And Nav Canada did so in a characteristic way: it bought the software from an Australian vendor, thus saving the cost of developing it. **********Mr. Cole, the controller in the Toronto tower, reflected on the technological changes as he went through his routine. He was dealing with layers of automation, to keep crowded runways and radio frequencies from bogging down. One layer was Atis, the Automated Terminal Information System, a recorded announcement of runway availability and weather conditions; announcing ''Atis is Golf'' meant that the seventh version of that recording, version ''G,'' was the most recent. **********Once, a controller would have read the announcement over and over. Now he simply said on the radio that version ''Golf'' was being used, and by touching the screen he could also communicate that information digitally to the cockpits of properly equipped planes. **********Similarly, ''S.I.D. Bulls'' meant the Standard Instrument Departure, the three-dimensional route the plane was to follow, was the one marked ''bulls'' in the instruction book for the airport. **********Previously, Mr. Cole scrawled the data out by hand, put the paper in a plastic case and sent it on to the runway controller in what he called a ''guided fling.'' **********''It's simply different, another way to do the job,'' said Mr. Cole, who has been an air traffic controller for 12 years. **********Ms. Garvey of the F.A.A. is looking for a new way to handle air traffic. ''Our system, while I would not say it's broken, is certainly showing signs of strain,'' she said. But she stressed that the decision was up to Congress, and predicted that changes would come more gradually in the United States than they did in Canada. **********''Things happen here in a sort of iterative way,'' she said."

Investors demand high yields to compensate for high currency and credit risk. **********It's less obvious why yields should now be high on collateralized Brady bonds. Though issued by Latin American governments, these bonds are denominated in dollars, and repayment of all or part of the principal (though not interest) is effectively guaranteed by the United States Treasury. Yet the yield spreads between these Bradys and comparable Treasuries are now temptingly wide. **********Richard Gray, head of emerging-markets debt research at Rogge Global Partners of London, points to one example of a Brady, Mexican par bonds due in 2019, which were trading last week at around 77 cents per dollar of face value, giving them a yield of 8.6 percent. That is more than 3 percentage points more than Treasuries of the same maturity, which finished the week yielding about 5.4 percent. Some similar Brazilian par bonds due in 2024 traded at about 57 cents on the dollar, yielding 10.9 percent. **********For yield-hungry investors, though, a caveat: Not all Bradys are collateralized, and those that are may be only partly covered. On those Brazilian pars, for instance, 28 cents on the dollar is guaranteed, reckons Umran Demimirors of the Templeton Emerging Debt fund. And the big denominations of Bradys, usually $250,000 or more, put them beyond the reach of many individual investors."

Gen. Sir Michael Jackson -- faltered early this morning. **********Late Sunday, a NATO diplomat said Yugoslav commanders, meeting with allied officers in Macedonia, were objecting to letting in peacekeepers unless the United Nations Security Council first authorized them, a condition that some allies view as unacceptable. **********NATO officials said the bombing would not stop until the Serbs started moving troops out of Kosovo. ''I think if we don't come to a conclusion down there,'' Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, the spokesman for the allied military command, said on Sunday, ''the operations will be intensified.'' **********He added, ''The aircraft are in the area, the pilots are still there and all the assets are still there.'' **********Trying to explain why Yugoslav commanders were balking at withdrawal terms that Mr. Milosevic had appeared to agree to, a senior diplomat here said, ''They were trying to water down what they agreed to last week.'' **********NATO's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said allied field commanders refused to negotiate the terms, which are said to require the Serbs to shut their antiaircraft defenses within 48 hours, to pull all of their military, police and paramilitary forces out of Kosovo by designated routes within seven days, and to let in 45,000 peacekeepers. **********If those terms are met, the allies expect about 1.5 million Kosovo Albanians to try to return home, including those who fled to other countries and those displaced within Kosovo. **********The attempt to bar the peacekeeping force without Security Council approval struck at the weakest link in the recent chain of events that the allies were counting on to result in a victory. **********The United States and Britain had agreed with France, Germany and other European allies that the peacekeeping force should have the Security Council's authorization. But American and British officials said that if approval was delayed and the Serbs were withdrawing troops, NATO should be ready to move in to prevent a vacuum. **********France and most of the European allies did not see things that way, and neither did Russia. **********Western diplomats hoped that Russia would approve a Security Council resolution sending in peacekeepers regardless of whether Mr. Milosevic wanted them, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Russia had said it might also join the peacekeeping force on its own terms. **********But Russia would certainly not have approved of NATO troops entering Kosovo without a resolution. **********On Sunday, in remarks televised in Moscow, the Russian Prime Minister, Sergei V. Stepashin, made clear that Russia was not pleased with NATO's terms. **********''Too many questions are being solved with NATO calling the tune,'' Reuters quoted him as saying. ''Our task is to prepare a serious resolution on Yugoslavia for the Security Council. We have to treat it very seriously.'' **********Mr. Milosevic's military negotiators raised their objections just when the foreign ministers of Russia and the seven largest industrial democracies, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan, are about to meet to discuss a draft resolution on Kosovo; they are due to meet today, near Bonn. **********Russia had been insisting that the allies stop the bombing before the Security Council votes, but the breakdown of the talks put off any pause in the air campaign. **********''We want to get it right, we want to pin down all of the detail, we want to make it watertight, and if that takes two extra hours, it will save us many days of agony subsequently,'' Mr. Shea said. **********Aside from the dispute over a resolution, the Serbian commanders were reportedly pressing NATO to keep the Kosovo Liberation Army, comprising Kosovo Albanians, from attacking the withdrawing Serbian forces. **********The Serbs know that one of the most dangerous moves for any military force is disengagement and retreat. **********The allies have long said they did not want to become the Kosovo Liberation Army's air force, and still insist that NATO has no direct contact with the rebels. **********But for the last few weeks, allied planes have been bombing Serbian tanks and artillery positions that were firing at the rebels along the Albanian border. Even as NATO and Yugoslav officials met yesterday, fighting continued along the border with Albania between Serbian forces and Kosovo Albanian rebels. NATO too continued its bombing. **********General Jertz, of the allied command, said most of the bombing runs among the 431 missions that NATO planes flew on Saturday and on Sunday morning had focused on Serbian forces battling the rebels. **********NATO said its planes hit 14 Serbian tanks and artillery pieces at the border in the last two days. In addition, the Pentagon said 13 artillery pieces, a battalion-size staging area, five mortars, and several fixed positions, including ammunition dumps and early-warning radar sites, were  struck on Sunday. **********The plan for the peacekeepers was that, upon entering Kosovo, they would see to it that the rebel army was disbanded; it is believed to number between 6,000 and 10,000 fighters. **********''I don't anticipate that we are going to have a lot of trouble with the K.L.A.,'' General Jertz said. ''The K.L.A. want their people to go back home to their own country, and that is one of the reasons why we think that they will be following the guidance which they will get from us.'' **********Among the allies in Europe, except for the British, there is widespread impatience to see the bombing stop.  Leaders in the United States and Britain have warned that Mr. Milosevic might be up to his old tricks, trying to sow confusion among his enemies by appearing to accept surrender, then trying to renegotiate by haggling over details. **********Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said on Sunday that Serbia had no future with Mr. Milosevic at the helm. ''It must be in the interests of people in Serbia to have him go,'' he told the BBC. **********The NATO Secretary General, Javier Solana, made similar remarks.  ''It's not NATO's aim to depose Milosevic; it never has been,'' he told the Spanish television station Telecinco. ''But I think all citizens of good faith, not only in Europe but all over the world, would like Milosevic to give up power in Serbia.'' **********About 2,000 British and German soldiers arrived in Macedonia on Saturday, joining the 15,000 mostly European troops already there as part of the planned peacekeeping force, Mr. Shea said. **********General Jertz said NATO had received reports of Serbian shelling of areas near Mitrovica where Kosovo Albanian refugees had taken shelter. **********NATO officials said they had also heard reports of ''mass looting'' by Serbian military and police forces in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, on Friday and Saturday. ''This gives indications that troops may be trying to help themselves as they prepare to leave Kosovo,'' Mr. Shea said. **********Allied reconnaissance also spotted a military train moving from Urosevac, in southern Kosovo, to the north toward Serbia, and heard reports of convoys of civilian vehicles headed north, allied spokesmen said. But they had no confirmation it meant  Serbian forces were pulling out. **********Although fighting had slowed in the northern and central parts of the province in the last few days, they said, it has not stopped. **********''Serb forces will not halt their operations until the senior commanders give them the order,'' General Jertz said, before the talks broke down. ''Let us hope this will happen soon.'' **********General Jackson had also told the Yugoslav military leaders that the allies expected all Serbian forces to withdraw to Serbia, and not to be transferred to the other constituent republic of Yugoslavia, Montenegro. **********NATO wants to forestall any outbreak in Montenegro, the one part of Yugoslavia that has tried to come to terms with the new Europe. The allies have warned that any attack by Mr. Milosevic on Montenegro would be viewed with the utmost seriousness -- just as President Bush warned about Kosovo a decade ago."

Corporate executives who wanted to free up their hands during long phone conversations invariably chose speaker phones -- despite the fact that they offered less privacy and questionable sound quality. **********But the need for multitasking, at work and at home, has changed that. Think of Tom Cruise screaming, ''Show me the money!'' into the microphone of a headset in the movie ''Jerry Maguire.'' **********It might be a stretch to say headsets are hip, but they are certainly becoming more and more useful. A workplace populated with cubicle dwellers means speaker phones are less practical. And nobody can just talk on the telephone anymore. **********''Gone are the days when you put stuff in your Out basket and gave it to your administrative assistant,'' said Tom Benoit, marketing communications manager for Plantronics, in Santa Cruz, Calif., which says it is the leading maker of headsets in the United States. ''The demand on workers to perform many functions at once has increased. Today, you'll probably have to do your own filing while you talk on the phone.'' **********The increase in the number of at-home workers has prompted large retail outlets like Radio Shack and Staples to sell headsets, once available only through employers or office supply catalogues. Now anyone who needs to type on a computer, open mail, punch a calculator or apply fingernail polish  while talking on the phone may want to buy  a headset. **********Plantronics began selling headsets, a fairly simple technology involving a speaker and a microphone, in 1962. Its products were worn by astronauts on the Apollo space missions. **********Today there are 125 million workers in the United States, and about 10 million use the phone four or more hours each day, making them prime candidates for a headset, said a Plantronics spokeswoman, Anne Friscia. She said the market for headsets was estimated at $452 million in 1997 and was increasing at a rate of 17 percent a year. **********Beyond multitasking, one reason for the growing popularity of headsets is a heightened awareness among workers of the damage that can be caused by cradling a telephone handset (or an ever smaller cellular phone) between your head and your shoulder. **********Alan Hedge, a professor of ergonomics at Cornell University, said the practice of bending your neck and raising one shoulder to hold the phone so your hands can be free could change the shape of the spine. ''You end up with restricted range of motion and with back, neck and shoulder problems,'' he said. **********Professor Hedge said maintaining such a posture for a prolonged period could cause symptoms similar to those associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, a common workplace ailment that involves tingling and pain in the hands and fingers and is caused by compression of nerves in the wrist. **********''The median nerve that goes down to the fingertips starts at your neck,'' Professor Hedge said. ''If you trap that nerve at the neck, you get the same tingling sensation in the fingers that you get by trapping the nerve at the wrist. There's some evidence that in a number of cases of what's diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome, the problem isn't inside the wrist, it's at the neck.'' **********Manufacturers make headsets in a range of styles, including traditional over-the-head models, headsets that fit over the ear or inside the ear, ultralight models that weigh less than one-third of an ounce and headsets for mobile phones. **********Telephone headsets designed for office use range in price from about $50 to $250, and most provide such features as mute buttons, volume controls and automatic sound protection that keeps incoming noise -- like that emitted by fax signals -- at comfortable levels. Good-quality headsets also have static-resistant components and  adjustable headbands, and many offer microphones with noise-canceling capability to cut out background sounds. **********Customers should be wary, however, of changes in technology that may make a headset bought today obsolete in a matter of months. A cordless headset telephone manufactured by Aastra Telecom and sold by Bed, Bath and Beyond for $89.99 failed to work when tested in December, and the only advice from the company's technical support line was to send it back and get a new one. But when a replacement was requested, a company spokeswoman said the product was being discontinued in favor of another model using new technology, to be offered sometime this spring. **********With the advent of voice recognition technology and Internet telephony, many manufacturers now make headsets that allow a user to switch between a personal computer and a telephone. The Andrea Electronics Corporation of Long Island City, Queens, recently introduced the first desktop device that lets headset users connect to a telephone and a PC simultaneously, without having to pause to switch back and forth. A user can have a conversation on the telephone while simultaneously having a microphone pick up the conversation and, through voice-recognition software, enter it as text into a PC. **********The Andrea Connect Solutions Personal Computer-Telephone Interface, or PCTI (list price, $149.95) and Andrea Provoice Solutions headsets ($99.95 and $124.95) can be purchased via the company's Web site, at www.andreaelectronics.com; the customer service department, at (800) 707-5779, or though Wal-Mart on line, at www.wal-mart .com. **********The headset models described here were tested on a home telephone system. They range in price from about $70 to $220 (for headset and amplifier). Two are designed to work with an amplifier attached to a telephone. One is a telephone and the other a headset that attaches to a telephone without an amplifier. There are other models on the market; these are simply some of the more common, easily available ones. **********GN NETCOM PROFILE SUREFIT 405-FLEX  ($112). This is the only three-in-one headset (traditional headset plus ear loops and ear hooks) on the market, and is made by Plantronics's chief competitor, GN Netcom, based in Nashua, N.H. **********The headband can be converted to be worn with ear loops or ear hooks, which are often preferred by people who wear glasses. The MPA-II amplifier ($108) is relatively easy to install, and the Profile headband is comfortable and weighs slightly less than the Plantronics Duoset headset. Sound quality was generally good, but there was a bit of static in the background. This model has a quick disconnect feature, which allows you to unplug the headset from the unit easily. (GN Netcom products are sold through distributors. To find one near you, call GN Netcom at (800) 826-4656.) **********PLANTRONICS DUOSET CONVERTIBLE HEADSET  ($100). This headset can be worn over the head or with one of three ear hooks of different sizes. The Vista Universal Amplifier ($120) is easy to install and allows you to use the headset with a phone. **********The headband is comfortable and sturdy. Sound quality is excellent. The headset also has a quick-disconnect feature and a cord that is slightly longer than GN Netcom's Flex headset. (Information on buying Plantronics products can be found on the company's Web site, at www.plantronics.com; to find a distributor in your area, call (800) 544-4660.) **********RADIO SHACK SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT TELEPHONE HEADSET ET-153  ($69.99). This is a small phone attached to a headset, so no separate amplifier is needed. The headset is noticeably less comfortable than either the Duoset by Plantronics or the Profile by GN Netcom. But sound quality is good. Because the telephone keypad is designed to hook onto your waistband, the headset cord is very short. If you find it awkward to hook the keypad onto your clothing, as I did, and would rather leave the keypad on the desk as you type into your computer, this headset is frustrating to use. **********There is no quick-disconnect function, so you can easily forget, step away from your desk and find that the keypad has fallen on the floor. **********PLANTRONICS PLX-500  ($79.99). This headset includes an amplifier. The headband is not as comfortable as the Duoset or the Profile -- it is slightly heavier and is difficult to adjust for a good fit. It would be acceptable, though, for someone who is not on the phone for several hours every day. The headset cord is long enough but is not flexible, so it cannot be lengthened, as the more expensive Duoset and Profile cords can. **********Sound quality is good, although the device has an annoying tendency to fade in and out when the caller is dialing a number on a touch-tone phone. One person who received a call reported a slight echo."

Every day, hundreds of people burn up the sites known as stock message boards, pondering the fate of the company, a software developer in San Carlos, Calif., that recently released its first products, including a Java-based Web browser. In December and January, Imaginon postings on the Yahoo Finance board went from a few dozen a week to a few dozen a day to a few dozen an hour, with daily trading volume climbing from near zero to its current average of 1.84 million shares. **********As stock message boards grow in popularity -- well over 30,000 messages are posted on the four largest boards on a typical day -- pressure is mounting on several fronts to rid the boards of people who use them to illegally tout stocks and spread false information. The Securities and Exchange Commission has defined such touting as lying about companies, lying about one's independence from a company or failing to adequately disclose the nature, source and amount of compensation one receives from a company. **********As talk about Imaginon grew on the message boards, fueled by a reverse acquisition the company completed on Jan. 20, its stock price shot up, from 41 cents a share in October to a high of $15.25 in intraday trading on Jan. 26; the stock closed at $5.75 on Friday. **********''It's kind of like the Jerry Springer show -- it's gotten out of hand,'' said David M. Schwartz, chief executive of Imaginon, who attributes the volatility to the message-board chatter. From time to time, Mr. Schwartz posts his own messages on Yahoo's board. Using the name IMON2nd and identifying himself as the chief executive, he says he tries to dispel the many rumors about the company. At the end of January, only days after Mr. Schwartz had dismissed a rumor that the company had inked a deal with America Online, someone using the name GGekko1999 logged on, inquiring whether anyone had heard that Barron's, the financial weekly, was predicting that the stock would hit $225 a share. (Barron's wasn't.) **********Mr. Schwartz said he worried that the rumors and volatility were scaring away long-term investors. ''Our stock has been all over the map, and that doesn't do us any good in the long run,'' he said. **********He is not alone in such concerns. To track down flagrant abusers of the message boards, the S.E.C. is increasing the number of subpoenas it issues to board operators, allowing it to try to tie a posting to an E-mail address. Though the commission declined to say how many subpoenas it was issuing, board operators say that they have become much more frequent and that the S.E.C. is requiring a quicker response. **********Companies fearing possible stock manipulation have raised their own complaints with securities regulators and board operators. But executives at the four largest boards -- Yahoo Finance, Silicon Investor, the Motley Fool and the Raging Bull -- worry that in the frenzy to eliminate abuse, legitimate investors will face restrictions on what they can say on the boards. **********''Anyone who looks at the boards knows that there's some manipulation involved,'' said Ethan Caldwell, the general counsel for Go2net Inc., the Seattle-based parent of Silicon Investor, whose boards average 15,000 postings a day. ''It's a double-edged sword, because the boards are a unique medium where the average investor can find out information. The flip side is that the stocks are subject to manipulation.'' **********But distinguishing between manipulation and the innocuous musings of an enthusiastic investor can be difficult. Though rules vary from board to board, few messages are ever removed. In fact, of the four largest board providers, only the Motley Fool even monitors its boards, never mind screen them for accuracy, which all four regard as impossible. Instead, the board providers rely heavily on self-policing, with participants complaining to the board operator and the S.E.C. when they think someone is trying to manipulate a stock. **********''We're just not going to censor to deal with a few kooks,'' said John Scheibel, the director of government relations for Yahoo, who likens its role to that of a post office, where information is simply distributed. On a typical day, the 8,445 message boards of Yahoo Finance -- each devoted to a particular stock -- receive tens of thousands of messages. William C. Martin, a founder of Raging Bull, added, ''We don't want to be fact-checkers.'' Since starting in June, the service has seen the number of messages triple, to 6,000 a day. **********MUCH of the problem lies in the anonymity provided by the message boards. With little effort, people can create several identities on the boards and keep changing their names, often bouncing from board to board. If someone is suspected of manipulating a stock on a board, the S.E.C. can issue subpoenas, but even if it can obtain a user's real E-mail address, investigators must still match the user's postings to sales activity. **********''Once they get a cheap stock, they have to manipulate it, and the best way to manipulate it is to quickly spread false information,'' said Richard H. Walker, director of enforcement at the commission, describing its Internet surveillance as ''one of the highest priorities.'' During a single day in October, in its first sweep in this area, the commission filed 23 enforcement actions against 44 individuals accused of touting stocks. **********A spokesman for the S.E.C. said the commission would also investigate message-board users who spread negative rumors. **********Enforcement actions can include formal charges, fines and bans on future trading. The S.E.C. can sue in Federal court or bring an administrative proceeding; in either case, the accused can mount a defense. **********After the October action, complaints to the S.E.C. about message-board activity rose from about 120 a day to as many as 400, then receded to about 200 to 300. About 120 investigators actively surf the Internet, looking for abuse on the message boards, Mr. Walker said. **********The S.E.C. and most companies tend to ignore so-called chat rooms -- which can also be filled with rumors -- because the real-time talk on such sites is quickly erased. ''We consider the worst threat the posting on the bulletin boards, because it stays up there virtually forever,'' said Michael D. Allison, chief executive of International Business Research in Princeton, N.J., a corporate investigations firm. **********MANY companies are at a loss as to how to respond. But last October, Medinah Energy Inc., a tiny mining company based in Lake Elsinore, Calif., took the unusual step of suing people who posted disparaging messages about the company. The suit contended that they had made ''false and defamatory statements.'' **********The suit listed the on-line pseudonyms of the authors, since actual names or other identifying characteristics were unknown, according to Michael Morrison, Medinah's lawyer. As a result, he said, he is not sure where the suit will go next. But filing it stemmed the flow of message-board chatter. **********Some companies try to press their cases with the S.E.C. John Stark, director of Internet enforcement for the commission, said the number of calls from corporate investor-relations officials about message boards  has gone from several a month to several a day. Some companies appeal directly to the message boards, though they are rarely successful. **********''We get a ton of requests from corporate officers and even corporate counsel to remove messages,'' said Mr. Caldwell of Go2Net. ''And we tell them in as nice a way as we can that we have no way of knowing if the information is true.'' **********Mr. Schwartz said his own postings have not kept rumors off the board. A few days after asking whether the stock would jump, GGekko1999 was back on, asking whether the company was really teaming up with a major Internet service provider -- another false rumor.''I'm going to continue to post, but I haven't seen any real effect,'' Mr. Schwartz said."

J. Habibie and his army chief, Gen. Wiranto, begged for more time to put East Timor in order. **********Early today, after violence in the territory showed little sign of abating despite two days of martial law, Mr. Annan decided to evacuate the United Nations mission in East Timor -- several hundred foreign and local employees and their families. He also asked officials here to begin contingency planning for an outside military force for the territory, a step the Indonesians have rejected repeatedly in recent weeks. **********''We cannot stand by and allow the people of East Timor to be killed,'' a visibly drawn Mr. Annan said this morning after a night of telephone conversations with world leaders, including two with President Habibie. **********But a few hours later, the Security Council was told that plans for evacuating the United Nations' East Timor mission had been suspended, to be reviewed in 24 hours. An official here said that General Wiranto had told Mr. Annan's top political adviser that he needed another day to negotiate with military chiefs in the territory -- an admission that he could not insure even the safety of a United Nations withdrawal, or what would happen after the mission left. **********At the same time, the Security Council, meeting in private, rejected a strong plea from Portugal today to hold a formal, open Council debate on how to respond to the crisis, which would have forced the 15 member nations to state their positions in the face of the crisis. Portugal, which is not a Council member, could not call the open meeting, only request it. **********Peter van Walsum, the Dutch representative and this month's Council president, said there was no consensus among members for such a meeting. The Council, he said, preferred to wait until a five-member mission that it sent to Indonesia on Monday had a chance to meet President Habibie and possibly General Wiranto on Thursday. **********General Wiranto, who replaced his commander in East Timor today, has very little control in the territory, said John Bresnan, an expert on Indonesia at Columbia University's East Asian Institute, who recently returned from Indonesia. In East Timor, he said, officers connected to the former chief of Indonesia's most powerful commando unit, Lieut. Gen. Prabowo Subianto -- a son-in-law of Indonesia's deposed President, Suharto -- have almost all the local power in their hands, and they could defy Jakarta's efforts to end the violence for political reasons. **********Diplomats and officials here, like Mr. Bresnan and other academic experts, say that the crisis in East Timor has hit Indonesia at its most vulnerable political moment in decades. There will inevitably be political fallout, they say, but they add that no one can predict what it will be. Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative at the United Nations, said today that an acute awareness of this unstable political situation plays a significant role in the thinking here during these tense days. **********''There is a real crisis of leadership in the country,'' said Mr. Bresnan, a former Ford Foundation director in Jakarta and the author of  ''Managing Indonesia'' (Columbia University Press). ''Nobody is really in charge very much. All the institutions are down, including the army. They are divided by factions, personalized factions. So you have people acting as individuals, dealing with other individuals, and no institutions functioning at all. **********''People speak of the government,'' he said. ''There is no single government. ''Habibie is still trying to get elected. He needs the army's votes to get elected. He has to be very cautious of General Wiranto. General Wiranto is very cautious because he is also a survivor of the Suharto regime, like Habibie. **********''He has to be primarily concerned with preserving what unity he can within the army itself,'' Mr. Bresnan said. ''That is his top priority, not what the I.M.F. does, not what the Security Council does.'' This partially explains why Indonesia seems to care so little about public opinion as militias roam East Timor, driving frightened people into exile, he said. **********''Most people in Indonesia don't care about East Timor,'' he added. It is a very small part of a large nation trying to deal with a political revolution and economic collapse. **********In the Security Council, there is growing support for international intervention, with China and Russia joining in condemning the violence and asking for action. China's deputy representative, Shen Guofeng, told reporters that his Government believed that the situation in East Timor was out of control. But all governments continue to insist that Indonesia be given every possible chance to reassert control. **********This poses a dilemma for the United Nations, which fears for the safety of not only its own officials and local employees in East Timor but also the 2,000 East Timorese who fled to the United Nations compound in the capital, Dili, for protection. Mr. Annan said this morning that their fate was also on his mind as he decided what to do. Today, officials were calling for volunteers to stay behind and maintain a United Nations presence if an evacuation was necessary. **********[Reuters reported that about 1,000 of the East Timorese at the compound fled into the mountains on Wednesday night, fearing a massacre if the United Nations evacuated.] **********The United Nations mission in East Timor had been expected to remain well into next year, by then bolstered with peacekeeping troops, to ease the region's transition to independence. Officials have considered asking Indonesia to move to that phase now, allowing international troops into the territory without admitting a loss of control. But Government leaders seem insistent that this phase must wait until after the newly elected Indonesian Parliament assembles in November and chooses a President. **********Those steps, too, are surrounded by uncertainty now. Officials here are watching the statements of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the Indonesian opposition leader whose party finished first, but without a clear majority, in national legislative elections. In the past, she has opposed letting East Timor go, echoing the strong nationalism of her father, Sukarno, who as Indonesia's first president attacked and bombed rebels in Sumatra and Sulawesi when they tried to secede. **********Although Mrs. Megawati has since changed her approach slightly, saying on Sunday that she is sorry about what the East Timorese are going through at the hands of Mr. Habibie, she may be more acceptable to the military than he is. Then, some diplomats ask, would the entire East Timor agreement be in jeopardy?"

P. Morgan will invest $85 million in SK Securities through a share sale that is partly aimed at raising money to pay Morgan an unspecified settlement fee. **********''This is a win-win arrangement,'' said Yoon Soon Han, general counsel of the SK Group, which controls the South Korean brokerage house. ''SK Securities can normalize its business while J. P. Morgan recovers a considerable amount of losses as well as securing a business opportunity.'' **********The agreement is intended to end legal disputes between Morgan and SK Securities, the Housing and Commercial Bank, the Daehan Investment Trust Company and the Korea Investment Trust Company. The only outstanding dispute for more than $100 million yet to be settled is with Boram Bank, which was taken over by Hana Bank in January. **********''We are very pleased that we have reached a settlement which provides us with a chance to focus on future relations,'' said Shuri Fukunaga, a Morgan spokeswoman in Tokyo. **********The American bank upgraded its presence in South Korea to a full branch last October in anticipation of a turnaround in the nation's economy, which is now emerging from its worst recession since the 1950's. South Korea's central bank expects the economy to grow about 8 percent this year after shrinking 5.8 percent last year. **********As part of the settlement, J. P. Morgan signed another pact with SK Securities, under which the Wall Street investment bank will provide the Korean brokerage with risk advisory, training, research and other business assistance. **********Morgan is the latest foreign investor to make a foray into the South Korean brokerage industry. Regent Pacific Group, a Hong Kong hedge fund, acquired the Daeyu Securities Company. And an Asian-Pacific arm of Hambrecht & Quist, the San Francisco investment bank that has agreed to be acquired by Chase Manhattan, became the largest shareholder in the Good Morning Securities Company, formerly known as Ssangyong Investment Securities. **********Morgan's disputes with South Korean companies arose over who should be responsible for derivatives losses begun with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997, an event that led to recessions in much of Asia."

After weeks of intense speculation in the magazine industry, Michael Caruso, the current editor in chief of Details, has stepped down. **********Introduced to the American market in 1997, Maxim, a testosterone-rich, off-color bible of sports, sex and humor for young men, has proved to be one of the most successful new magazines of the decade. It has wind-sprinted in ad pages and circulation past its competitors in the men's market, like Details, Conde Nast's GQ, Wenner Media's Men's Journal, the Hearst Corporation's Esquire and Gear, a title introduced last year by Bob Guccione Jr. **********In December, Details, GQ and Esquire all seemed to have mimicked Maxim's standard cover: a gorgeous, seminude starlet and headlines -- like ''The Triumph of Cleavage Culture'' on Esquire -- that emphasize sex over substance. **********Judging from Maxim's success, American readers do not crave substance. Maxim was introduced in England in 1995 by Felix Dennis, the owner of Dennis Publishing. Mr. Dennis then bet that readers in this country were ready for an American version of the Maxim sensibility, which stresses post-adolescent pleasures over grown-up refinement. **********Maxim delivered; the circulation rate base guaranteed to advertisers for the second half of 1999 is 950,000 readers in the United States -- an increase of 111 percent over the corresponding period last year. By comparison, the guaranteed rate base of Details for the six months that ended in June 1998 was 475,000. For the 10 issues of 1998, Maxim ran 630 ad pages, according to an estimate by the Publishers Information Bureau. The current January/February issue carries 62.5 ad pages, an increase of 75 percent from the period a year earlier. **********A Conde Nast executive, who insisted on anonymity, said that James Truman, the Conde Nast editorial director, became enamored of Maxim last year. He saw Mr. Golin as a fix for Details, which under Mr. Caruso went through several variations to attract readers, emphasizing at various times features about sports, music, personal grooming or men's fashions. Despite an inconsistent editorial vision, ad pages grew under Mr. Caruso's watch, from 1,083 pages in 1997 to 1,125 in 1998; advertising revenue grew from $35 million in 1997 to $38 million in 1998, according to the publishers bureau. **********Conde Nast, part of Advance Publications, purchased Details in 1990, when it was an urban monthly with a distinctly downtown Manhattan voice. Mr. Caruso arrived in May 1997, after two years as editor in chief of Los Angeles magazine and a stint as a senior articles editor at Vanity Fair. Mr. Caruso replaced Joe Dolce, an editor who read about his dismissal in the pages of The New York Observer. **********Mr. Golin, a former editor at Rodale Press in Emmaus, Pa. -- which publishes Men's Health, among other titles -- moved to New York in early 1997 to work as Bonnie Fuller's deputy at Cosmopolitan, the Hearst Corporation's leading women's magazine. Ms. Fuller has since become the editor in chief of Glamour, a Conde Nast magazine. **********Mr. Golin's move may seem like an odd fit for Conde Nast, a company long known for its arbiters of cool insider elegance, like Alexander Liberman, its onetime editorial director. But Mr. Golin -- the author of such coverlines as ''Touch Her Right Here: 10 Hot Spots for One-Stroke Seduction'' and ''Hollywood's Sexiest Mommies'' -- said that he would not feel out of place and that he was pleased to work in the company of Ms. Fuller again. **********''I will try not to wear overalls and chew hay in the office,'' he said, adding: ''Michael turned out a good magazine, but obviously I will make some changes. I would like to bring a bit of my sense of humor to the thing.'' **********The men's market will continue to grow toward the cheeky and adolescent. Emap Petersen, the United States subsidiary of the British publisher Emap P.L.C., plans to introduce FHM, the chief competitor for Maxim's readers in the British market, by the end of this year. **********Mr. Golin said that he was not worried, that his principal interest was his readers and that his readers' principal interest was women. ''I think,'' he said, ''if you are going to have a general-interest magazine for men, well -- surprise, surprise -- one of men's general interests is women.'' **********He declined to comment on his salary, saying that would be ''so gauche.'' **********Mr. Caruso had only a brief comment on the transition. ''I had a wonderful staff,'' he said, ''and I wish them the best of luck in the future incarnation.''"

Mr. Shah said he expected the team to arrive by the first week in July and spend about a week removing the potentially dangerous substances. **********Several diplomats here said they were troubled by the precedent of permitting Iraq to choose United Nations inspectors, but a spokesman for the Secretary General said that ''cleaning up this lab has nothing to do with limiting the special commission's mandate.'' It was a matter of  safety, he asserted. **********Meanwhile, Secretary General Annan appears to have abandoned an earlier effort to find a temporary chief who is not an American to head the embattled special commission, which is known as Unscom. Richard Butler, the commission's chairman, is scheduled to resign from his post on June 30th. At that time, Charles Duelfer, his American deputy, is to become acting chairman. **********Spokesmen for the Secretary General, who is in Russia today on an official visit, would not discuss who Mr. Annan had asked to temporarily replace Mr. Butler. But United Nations officials said that several weeks ago, Mr. Annan had asked Jayantha Dhanapala, the Undersecretary General for Disarmament Affairs, to take the post and that Mr. Dhanapala had declined. **********Members of the Security Council had also objected to other suggested candidates, including members of the commission that oversees Unscom, diplomats said. Even Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative here and Unscom's harshest critic, preferred to see an American temporarily in charge rather than someone new who might give the impression that Russia had softened its hostility to Unscom or its demand that it be replaced. **********The developments come as the Security Council has been attempting to close a deep rift over policy toward Iraq. Russia, China, and France have favored an immediate lifting of sanctions, while the United States and Britain staunchly oppose that unless and until Iraq answers outstanding questions about its weapons programs and cooperates fully with inspectors. **********Support in the Council has been slowly building for a compromise resolution introduced earlier this week by Britain and the Netherlands. The resolution could pave the way for suspending United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq if Baghdad complies with its disarmament commitments and cooperates with a new inspection agency, a successor to Unscom. **********So far, Iraq has denounced the draft as unacceptable, but Baghdad might be isolated if most Council members embrace the proposal as a respectable compromise. **********Iraq had also refused to permit Unscom inspectors to return to Baghdad even to remove what it and Russia asserted were the dangerous chemical substances left behind when Unscom inspectors left Iraq shortly before American air strikes began in December. Unscom officials say that slightly more than two pounds of mustard gas and minute samples of sarin and other agents remain inside the Unscom headquarters in Baghdad, and that the substances pose no threat to the health or safety of Iraqis. **********Senior diplomats here said that the United States had asked Mr. Annan's office to help resolve the problem over the toxic substances in a way that satisfied Iraq and Unscom. A senior diplomat here said American officials were ''taken aback'' when they learned that Mr. Annan's aides had asked the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an independent organization that monitors chemical-weapons agreements, to choose technical experts for the mission who did not have Unscom experience. **********''To allow the Iraqis to pick and choose who can enter their facilities and who heads the inspectors does not bode well for the current, or a future, United Nations inspection agency,'' said one United Nations official and critic of Iraq. **********At the same time, several diplomats noted that the new team would include at least one person on the special commission's payroll -- Jaako Ylitalo, a Finnish citizen who worked for the United Nations before joining Unscom. But Mr. Ylitalo is neither a chemist nor technical expert; he is to accompany the team as an administrator."

Albright warned that Russia was becoming increasingly isolated in the international community, threatening its larger relationships. **********But Dr. Albright also stressed the importance of relations with Russia for the United States, and none of the foreign ministers even suggested suspending Russia from the group, to which it had originally been invited by President Clinton. **********Nor was there any serious discussion about imposing economic or other sanctions on Moscow, which gave no indication of changing its policy or fierce tactics toward the Chechens two days before parliamentary elections in Russia on Sunday. **********As Russian forces continued to bomb Grozny, the Chechen capital, and to prevent civilians trapped there from seeking safety, the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, responded soothingly to the Western criticism, saying, ''On some issues our opinions coincide, on others they diverge, but what's important is that this issue should not lead to us growing apart.'' **********Mr. Ivanov insisted that ''I never felt isolated from my colleagues in the Group of 8,'' causing Dr. Albright to respond that Mr. Ivanov himself was treated with respect, but that Russia's behavior in Chechnya ''creates problems in the ways it deals with its partners.'' **********''What I think has been evident at this meeting, frankly, is that the Russians, through their actions, are self-isolating from the rest of the international community,'' she said. **********European and American officials said the host Germans, including Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, were particularly concerned that the meeting not concentrate on criticism of Russia, so there would be no important breach with Moscow, but focus instead on preventive diplomacy to stop future wars, a key issue for Mr. Fischer's Green Party. **********The officials said that the French were particularly outspoken in the meetings about the need to take action to show Moscow that its partners were serious about their criticism, and that the British, too, were taking a harder line. **********But even the harder-line European idea of ''no sanctions but no aid'' to Moscow creates problems for Washington, senior American officials said, since cutting or even suspending aid would be a sanction. **********Officials acknowledged that the timing of this meeting, so close to the Russian elections, was awkward, and left Moscow little room to compromise. The battle against the Chechens has been very popular among ordinary Russians, and some Western governments fear that strong Western action now would only backfire and help anti-Western politicians, like the Communists of Gennadi A. Zyuganov. Moscow in the meantime seems to be trying to conquer Grozny by Sunday, an American official said. **********Moscow responded to similar criticism by NATO foreign ministers in Brussels earlier this week by complaining of interference in internal affairs and citing NATO's bombing of Serbia over Kosovo this year. ''Another splash of crocodile tears in Brussels about 'human rights' simply amazes us by its cynicism,'' Mr. Ivanov's Foreign Ministry said. **********Here, Mr. Ivanov kept his cool. ''We are not talking of criticism of one party by another,'' he said. ''The situation is complicated, and there are no simple solutions.'' **********But Mr. Ivanov did not want to appear at a joint news conference with the other foreign ministers, to avoid sitting through public criticism. Instead, each minister had separate news conferences or briefings, while Mr. Fischer read a ''chairman's statement'' -- since member Russia would not agree to a joint statement -- calling for an immediate cease-fire and political negotiations with Chechen leaders to end the war, as Moscow has already promised but done little to bring about. **********''The fight against terrorists cannot be won by indiscriminate war against cities and the whole population,'' said the statement, approved by the seven other members. ''The war poses a serious threat to partnership and cooperation between Russia and all of us.'' **********But having allowed the chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Knut Vollebaek, to visit the region, Moscow is now expected to allow a few monitors from the security organization to watch the borders with Chechnya and Georgia -- ''a sop,'' a senior European official acknowledged, ''to their need and our need to show that something happened here.'' **********Dr. Albright also met here with leaders of the democratic opposition to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, on a day when a key Serbian opposition coalition finally halted its dwindling and now farcical daily rallies against Mr. Milosevic."

The commission, headed by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman, warns in the 143-page report that the country ''will be vulnerable to an increasing range of threats against American forces and citizens overseas, as well as at home,'' from terrorists or rogue states. **********''While conventional conflicts will still be possible, the most serious threat to our security may consist of unannounced attacks on American cities'' by terrorist groups using germ warfare, said a report summary. ''Another may be well-planned cyber-attack on the air traffic control system on the East Coast of the United States as some 200 commercial aircraft are trying to land safely in a morning's rain and fog.'' **********The commission predicted that the American military will increasingly be called upon to conduct humanitarian missions and what the Pentagon calls ''operations other than war'' in trouble spots around the world. But its status and influence will fuel resentment toward the United States, making it a target for attacks at home and abroad. In one of its grimmest predictions, the report added, ''Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers.'' **********The commission said the United States is not prepared to defend itself against terrorist threats at home. That, its report concluded, will lead to more pressure on the military to expand its scope into domestic law enforcement as the line between foreign and domestic threats is blurred. **********The commission's effort is the latest in a series of reviews undertaken inside and outside the Government during the last few years to try to assess threats to the United States in the post-cold-war era. Many of its findings echo those made by the Pentagon's own Quadrennial Defense Review in 1997 and a Congressional group, the National Defense Panel, which issued a report a year later. **********Still the commission is expected to  influence the debate over funding for the Pentagon and its programs for dealing with new threats, including a stronger focus on chemical and biological weapons and a missile defense system. **********At a news conference last week previewing the report, Mr. Rudman said he hoped that the commission's work would ultimately lead to a rethinking of the organization of the nation's national security agencies -- the way similar reviews after the end of World War II led to the creation of the Air Force, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. The commission stopped short of offering prescriptions, saying it would offer those in its subsequent reports. **********In looking ahead, the commission was not entirely gloomy. The spread of democracy, advances in medicine and technology and new economic opportunities raise the prospect of increased stability and security around the world, it said. **********But some of the same trends have less benign consequences. The increasing integration of the world's economy will mean that economic crises that were once local might spread, while scientific advances could hasten the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as missiles to fire them."

While pagers and cellular telephones are well known and branded with the Motorola ''wings'' logo, few know that the company deals in something called ''embedded solutions.'' **********So beginning today, Motorola is introducing a new print advertising campaign to tell the world that its ''embedded solutions'' -- the microchips hidden inside a growing number of everyday consumer products -- will now go by the name of ''Digital DNA,'' a new sub-brand to the Motorola name. **********Microchips, of course, are used in everything from computers and compact disk players to air bags and refrigerators. They are enabling technologies, say those in the know, a kind of blueprint or road map to the digital age, a future that Motorola executives say the company is helping to shape through its increasingly diverse semiconductor business. **********The new print campaign, which gets under way with a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal, seeks to bring attention to that while also paving the way for scores of products that are powered by Motorola chips to be affixed with a new logo that reads ''Digital DNA from Motorola'' with an accompanying red asterisk that serves as the signature tag. The Leo Burnett agency in Chicago is handling the account, which has billings estimated at more than $10 million. **********Motorola's effort to brand the silicon chips is not unlike Intel's campaign to co-brand with computer manufacturers by advertising that a Compaq computer, say, has an Intel pentium processor inside. **********Now, Motorola would like consumers to know that its chips are the brains behind a growing number of ''smart'' computer products that the company says ''think and link'' in an increasingly wired world. **********''If you go out and ask 10 people what Motorola makes, first it would be phones and pagers; not a lot know that it's also semiconductors, and that's what makes things smart,'' said William T. Edwards, an executive in the semiconductor division at Motorola. ''We want to be recognized for that.'' **********In order to do that, Motorola is getting the word out that its chips are everywhere. They are in networking equipment that routes Internet traffic under names like Cisco and 3Com; they are under the hood of Volvos and BMW's, sending digital signals that move mirrors and deploy air bags; they are even embedded in washing machines, microwaves and television set-top boxes. **********The print ads, which will appear in publications like Business Week and Forbes, use pithy headlines and text to explain Digital DNA, ''the heart of smart.'' One ad reads: ''What do the world's smartest products have in common? Answer: the red asterisk, the signature mark that says digital DNA. **********In some ways, Motorola faces a daunting task that scores of other companies have to deal with every day: How do you brand an ingredient, a component that is built into a more familiar brand name item? And how do you make the ingredient, well, sexy? **********''Intel has put a lot of media weight behind their effort,'' said Gwen Morrison, a retail marketing and design consultant at Frankel, a brand marketing agency in Chicago. ''There's a real advantage for a Motorola or Intel to do this because as technology products become more complex, it brings a kind of seal of approval; it says that the product has a special ingredient inside.'' **********The Intel Corporation is not the only company that has had success selling a little-understood technology or ingredient. Nutrasweet has tagged cans of Pepsi. And BASF A.G., the German chemical and pharmaceutical giant, has for at least a decade been running television spots created by Geer DuBois in New York that deliver a simple and compelling message: ''We don't make a lot of the products you buy. We make a lot of the products you buy better.'' Geer DuBois is now defunct, and Hampel/Stefanides in New York, the BASF agency, continues to create new spots. **********The BASF campaign, however, does not concern co-branding, which is eventually what Motorola would like to do. By sometime next year, Motorola executives say they would like the campaign to be so effective that customers would be compelled to put the Digital DNA logo on their products. **********Intel, which has a jazzy logo and even a jingle in its television spots, has so-called co-op branding contracts where it pays or otherwise compensates computer makers. Motorola, however, has no plans to pay for the co-branding opportunity. **********The company cannot simply affix Motorola's wings logo to products to indicate that its chips are inside because the chips are often in products that compete against the Motorola brand name, executives say, and that could create co-branding tensions, conflicts and consumer confusion. **********For Motorola, the Digital DNA effort grew, in part, out of a reorganization two years ago after the company's fortunes turned down with Asia. Its semiconductor division, based in Austin, Tex., went from a research-oriented effort to a more market-driven or customer-focused approach, executives say. **********The initiative simply involves selling more microchips and getting credit for powering a greater and greater variety of smart products. **********It is also an attempt to offer shareholders, analysts and customers a new way of valuing the company. **********''The thinking, of course, is letting people know all the great stuff we're in,'' said Karen Hanley, a director of brand marketing at Motorola. ''We did a lot of research with focus groups, and people said, 'It's about time you took credit for some of this.' ''"

Belgrade told the diplomats that it ''expected neighbors to refrain from taking any direct or indirect part in any action against Yugoslavia,'' according to Simona Miculescu, the Romanian spokeswoman, Reuters reported. **********The authorities in Belgrade have previously warned both Albania and Macedonia not to support hostile operations. **********''Our country won't allow its territory to be used in an attack on any neighboring country, including Yugoslavia, and I think NATO will accept this,'' the Macedonian Prime Minister, Ljubco Georgievski, said yesterday. **********The allies have given formal assurances that peacekeepers would go into Kosovo only if the Serbian authorities under Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, agree to accept them. Negotiators for the rebels signed an accord in Paris last week providing for political autonomy for the province and 28,000 peacekeepers to enforce it, but Mr. Milosevic refused, telling the American special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, in Belgrade on Tuesday that the peacekeepers would be one-sided and anti-Serb. **********The two million people of Kosovo, which the accord would leave under Serbian sovereignty for a three-year transition period, are 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Serbia and Montenegro are the constituent parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia headed by Mr. Milosevic, who abolished political autonomy for Kosovo when he was President of Serbia 10 years ago. **********The five countries Mr. Solana wrote to today are among the 24 members of the alliance's Partnership for Peace program, established after the end of the cold war to promote stability in relations between Western nations and formerly Communist nations. **********''The alliance has repeatedly made clear that the security of all NATO member states is inseparably linked to that of the partner countries,'' Mr. Solana wrote.

They note that a conservative opposition party also approved the cuts. **********Nonetheless, the 17 percent reduction in the agency's 1999 budget, a cut nearly three times that suffered by any Government ministry, came after a two-month campaign by the PRI that portrayed the institute as a wasteful agency that squanders taxpayers' money on endless tinkering with electoral lists and other democratic frills. **********In recent years the institute has overseen honest elections that have broken with decades of PRI-administered fraud, and Mr. Zedillo has basked in international praise because of the democratic advances. **********But since November, when the agency's nine-member governing council authorized an investigation of the PRI's financing of its 1994 election campaigns, including Mr. Zedillo's presidential campaign, the PRI has switched course dramatically, attacking the institute's impartiality and the integrity of several of its top officials. **********''The PRI senses that it can no longer control the institute, and with an eye to the presidential elections in 2000, is trying to weaken it and diminish its credibility,'' said Alberto Aziz Nassif, a professor who studies Mexico's political transition. **********The institute, which was established in 1990, was initially headed by successive Interior Ministers, all from the PRI. But since 1996 it has been autonomous. **********Last fall, the agency requested $240 million to finance operations this year, when it must prepare the national voter list for next year's presidential balloting. But the Congress cut the request by 17 percent, approving only $200 million. The institute's budget has declined steadily since 1994, when Congress appropriated nearly $600 million to organize presidential elections. In 1998 the budget was $232 million. **********In an interview the institute's president, Jose Woldenberg, a former professor who has carefully nurtured a reputation for political neutrality, called the budget cut disproportionate, noting that no cut of more than 6.6 percent was made in the request of any Government ministry. **********''This is a very, very large reduction,'' Mr. Woldenberg said. ''Every area of our operations will be affected.'' Nonetheless, he expressed confidence that with careful stewardship, the agency will organize credible presidential elections next year. **********Emilio Zebadua, one of the agency's nine governing counselors, who has often defended opposition points of view, said the budget cut was part of a campaign aimed at weakening the institute. **********''The real reason for the institute's current travails is that we have established a strict political independence,'' Mr. Zebadua said. **********Perhaps the clearest demonstration of that independence came last fall, when the institute approved a new investigation of the PRI's 1994 campaign expenditures. The party challenged the legality of the investigation, arguing that the institute had approved the 1994 campaign spending reports in 1995. **********But the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution argued before the institute that a new investigation was warranted. Constitutional reforms in 1996 had strengthened the agency's investigative powers, it said, and new evidence had emerged last year during a national banking scandal that added to suspicions of possible financial wrongdoing by the PRI. **********In November, after the institute approved the new investigation, Enrique Ibarra, the PRI's representative, walked out of the proceedings and has refused to take part in institute business since then. The party took its challenge of the new investigation to an electoral tribunal, but last month the tribunal upheld the legality of the investigation. **********In an interview, Mr. Ibarra said there was no connection between the the party's criticisms of the agency and the decision in Congress by the PRI and the conservative National Action Party December to cut the institute's budget. **********''You cannot interpret this as revenge-seeking, because National Action party deputies voted with us on these cuts,'' he said. ''This was a shared decision.'' **********Juan Miguel Alcantara, a National Action Party deputy, said his party's priority had been to avoid tax increases, which forced National Action to support painful cuts not only at the institute but at many other Government agencies."

''I didn't even listen.'' **********One reason that Mr. Dombroski did not have to pay attention was the fortunate timing of his birth. **********As Europe strives to build nimbler, lighter armies, France is among the nations that have dropped conscription. Mr. Dombroski and the 40 other young men at the Air Force base had only to be informed about the army before departing again, with hair still long, and, in some cases, body jewelry still attached. **********French men born after Jan. 1, 1980, no longer face an obligatory 10 months in the army. Like Britain and the United States before it, France plans to have an all-volunteer armed force by 2002. **********Spurred first by post-cold-war cuts in defense spending and more recently by superior American technological and logistical performance in the NATO air war over Kosovo last spring, Europe wants more agile, better equipped armed forces. Conscription-based armies, heavy with tanks and artillery designed to defend against invasion, are becoming a thing of the past, with Spain and perhaps Italy set to follow the French example. Soon, among the big Western European countries in NATO, only Germany will continue the draft. **********Mindful of the German militarism that caused two World Wars this century, Germany still views conscription as an instrument of democratic civilian control over the military -- as the Americans and, for two centuries, the French did before it. But now many European military planners and commanders see the draft as an obstacle to the slimmed-down, technologically advanced, rapidly deployable forces that the allies are trying to build to deal with trouble spots far from home -- the main mission that NATO is planning for in the 21st century. **********The 20th century mission was territorial defense. But the last threat of outside invasion vanished with the Soviet Union, and that has changed everything for allied armies. **********Marianne, the French version of Uncle Sam, still wants you all right, but only for a day. And military recruiters hope you remember the day fondly enough to come back as a volunteer. **********''If I didn't have a diploma, I'd think of volunteering,'' said Louis Gautron, a 19-year-old economics student who got his baccalaureat last year, entitling him to go to a university. ''I had no idea how many job skills you could learn in the army.'' **********He spoke midway through the ''call for defense preparation day'' that was held here and at 247 other sites around the country on Oct. 9. There have been 58 of these days since the first one a year ago. Not all are on weekends, and none are held in the vacation months of July and August. Starting next April, young French women will also be required to come spend a day learning at least a little about the military. **********In the first year, 514,664 young men heard what the army had to say in these sessions, which also involve a test of reading comprehension. Roughly a third of them, according to French military surveys, would be interested in coming back at least once to learn more. **********Military recruiters hope these sessions will make it easier to fill their volunteer quotas. The slimmed-down French armed forces of 2002 will still need 357,183 people in uniform -- 259,299 if the members of the gendarmerie, a national police force under the Ministry of Defense, are not counted. There were 500,000 people in the French military in early 1996, when President Jacques Chirac announced the new plan. **********''We've been reducing by roughly 30,000 draftees a year,'' Defense Minister Alain Richard, a member of the Socialist Government that inherited the plan in 1997 from Mr. Chirac's Gaullists, told local elected officials at Taverny. The air base, at the edge of a suburb northwest of Paris, has no airplanes but a large underground command center in a bunker. **********The local mayor had a question for Mr. Richard familiar to any American Secretary of Defense: ''Is the base at Taverny going to be kept open after the transition?'' **********Mr. Richard smiled. ''I don't know what my successor 20 years from now will do,'' he answered, ''but for the foreseeable future, I want to keep all large installations near big cities open, because we'd need them if we had to build our forces up again some day.'' **********Britain and the United States believe that their all-volunteer forces contain units that are more easily mobilized and sent on expeditions like the NATO-led peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. The reliance on conscripts meant that some continental European countries took far too long to get their forces on the move for Kosovo, French military officials believe. **********''The British and the French are the only countries in Europe that have readily deployable forces,'' Mr. Richard said. With changes in the structure of its armed forces, Germany, too, might have them in 10 years, he said. **********''But some countries took two months to send troops to Kosovo,'' he added, referring to some smaller NATO allies. **********European defense ministries were shocked by their own slow and cumbersome reaction and by technological gaps with the United States that the war over Kosovo revealed. **********Mr. Richard explained, in answer to a question from one of the youths called up for the day, that American planes had flown most of the bombing missions because the United States could get its aircraft there faster than most of the Europeans could. Reorganizing European defenses, he and other officials said, will shorten reaction times, and volunteer professional soldiers and reservists will be easier to move on short notice than draftees. **********Part of the French plan would create a 50,000-strong reserve to reinforce the regular army, as National Guard units do in the United States. **********Britain also designed a reserve flexibility into its system when it moved to all-volunteer forces in the early 1960's, with a Territorial Army of 40,000. A strategic defense review last year, aimed at reorganizing and redesigning British armed forces to make them more rapidly and easily deployable to places like Bosnia, Kosovo and now East Timor, allowed for an increase in the planned size of the army in 2005, to 114,000 soldiers from 109,000. **********''Moving from conscription to volunteer forces, you find that for the same amount of money, you can get a much more effective and easily deployable fighting force,'' said Lord Gilbert, until this summer a minister of the British Defense Ministry. **********Spain, like Britain and now France, plans to abolish the draft by the end of 2002, and to reduce its armed forces to about 168,000 by 2003, from 175,000 now. But Spanish Defense Ministry officials said that, with about three-quarters of the 300,000 Spanish men who come of draft age every year never actually spending a day in uniform, there were discussions about ending conscription even earlier. **********Germany, where 40 to 45 percent of the young men called choose alternative civilian service as firemen, paramedics, orderlies and the like, is the only major Western European country still committed to maintaining the draft. Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping has repeatedly supported conscription, which was adopted, along with ways of teaching soldiers when it is correct to disobey orders, when Germany's allies allowed the country to rearm in the 1950's. **********One reason for keeping the draft, some officials say, is that Germany's social services and hospitals may have to shut down if they suddenly have to do without all those volunteers doing alternative service. **********Italy's Parliament is considering a bill to reduce the size of the armed forces over three years. Now numbering 280,000 men, of whom 136,000 are draftees, the armed forces would drop to 200,000 volunteers -- including, for the first time, some women."

To the ordinary people who flock there for care, it is a monument to the ills that have crippled Venezuela and made possible the rise of President Hugo Chavez and the ''social revolution'' he has vowed to carry out: corruption, inefficiency, featherbedding and a political patronage system. **********Granted, this South American country of 23 million people continues to sit atop the largest reserves of oil outside the Middle East. But at hospitals across Venezuela so much equipment and supplies have simply disappeared -- and so little money is available to replace them -- that many patients, to their outrage, are now forced to bring their own sheets, syringes and medicine, and the ''moral renovation'' of public services has become a national crusade. **********''Everything in this country was politicized by an elite that took everything for itself and left nothing for the people,'' complained Jesus Boada, 70, who was visiting a granddaughter hospitalized with a stomach ailment. ''The result is what we have to put up with when we come here.'' **********Originally, Miguel Perez Carreno Hospital, named for a prominent surgeon who was also dean of the main medical school here, had 1,710 employees. But over the years, even as the number of beds in service was declining, that figure inflated to more than 5,000 workers, or nearly double the average number of employees per hospital bed in the United States, according to statistics compiled by the American Hospital Association. **********Included in that bloated work force was a substantial contingent hired not because of its qualifications but as a reward for loyalty to the party in power. Every time there was a change of government, one batch of political appointees would leave and be replaced by another from the rival party. **********''The bureaucracy kept growing and growing,'' said Dr. Jose Maria Urbina, 45, a traumatologist who was a student at the hospital during the years of the oil boom and now, as its medical director, is trying to halt the decline. ''People were paid, but didn't work, and since they had obtained their jobs because they had worked in someone's campaign, they could not be fired.'' **********That situation could perhaps be tolerated so long as Venezuela's oil bonanza continued. But when the market price of a barrel of oil fell, almost to the cost of production, so did the government's largess: hospital officials said their budget has not had a significant increase in at least a decade and has been frozen for the last two years. **********''Since you have so many employees and you don't pay them well, what you get is a mentality that says, 'I have a right to take home sheets or a pair of scissors once in a while,' '' said Robert Bottome, editor and publisher of the Veneconomia newsletter here. ''And since there is no accountability, there is no real check on corruption. **********Francisco Colmenares found that out when a series of operations were required on his right arm after an accident. During the most recent, he ''collaborated'' with the medical staff, as he put it, by buying the surgical needle and thread that was needed to sew him up but could no longer be found in the hospital's stocks. **********''It's not a normal situation, but that's what you have to put up with if you want to get medical attention,'' said Mr. Colmenares, a 52-year-old truck driver. ''We've been moving backward in this country.'' **********Because of the budget squeeze, the hospital's library cut all subscriptions to medical journals in 1994, a severe blow to an institution that is also a teaching hospital. In addition, someone recently stole three nursing textbooks from the library, so now all nurses are prohibited from examining the remaining manuals, which are locked up. **********Indeed, the problem of theft in Venezuelan hospitals is now so severe that Dr. Antonio Briceno, a physician and a member of the Constitutional Assembly that is drawing up a new charter for the nation at Mr. Chavez's insistence, wants to make it a criminal offense to be punished as severely as homicide. **********''The corrupt are murderers, and their crime should be treated just like terrorism, rape and drug trafficking,'' he said. **********While legal scholars and human rights groups here and abroad have criticized efforts by Mr. Chavez, a 45-year-old former army paratrooper, to shutter a Congress and court system he describes as corrupt and discredited, that appears to be of only secondary importance to ordinary Venezuelans. To them, the president's promises to overhaul public services that he has described as ''a series of disasters'' are far more important. **********Other vital sectors of government activity, not just health care, are also  afflicted with such problems. A public education, for instance, is supposed to free, or so promises the current Constitution, ratified in 1961 and disdained by Mr. Chavez as ''moribund.'' **********Teachers, though, are underpaid and schools are chronically underfinanced and in ill repair, so many principals have devised a system that requires parents to pay a ''registration fee'' of up to $50 per pupil to enroll their children. Often, those pupils whose families will not or cannot pay are not allowed to attend classes, constitutional guarantees notwithstanding. **********Since taking office in February, however, Mr. Chavez has condemned that system and recently announced that he would allow no such fees to be collected this school year and will dismiss any educator who defies him. **********Principals complain that with no increase in government financing being offered, instruction will inevitably suffer. Parents, however, have generally hailed the move. **********''This is a rich country, and we should not have to pay for a right that is ours by law,'' said Amanda Escobar Lujan, a mother of three who was shopping for school supplies here. ''We would not even be in this situation if the political parties had not been plundering the national treasury for 40 years, lining their pockets and stealing from our children.''"

The top Internet service provider rented a concert hall and treated 1,700 guests to Champagne, hors d'oeuvres and a show by Carlinhos Brown, the dreadlocked percussionist pop star. **********Three weeks later the outlook for America Online in Brazil, the world's seventh-largest Internet market, is a bit clouded. **********Francisco Loureiro, the president of AOL Brazil, abruptly left the company amid differences with other executives. Mr. Loureiro's departure came at the same time consumer protection authorities were reported to be weighing the possibility of fining AOL as much as 3 million reais, or about $1.4 million, after numerous complaints over the alteration of online browsing systems by the company's installation software. **********''It might be that because of their tremendous growth in the United States that they just packed their bags and headed to Brazil,'' said Louana d'Oliveira, the president of Sky3, a Florida-based consulting firm specializing in Latin America's Internet industry. ''The need to brand their product beforehand, to entice and educate consumers, didn't seem to be a priority in Brazil.'' **********AOL's troubles reflect the tumultuous and highly competitive environment that American Internet companies are facing as they seek to expand their presence in other countries like Brazil. Yahoo, Microsoft, Telefonica of Spain and the New York-based StarMedia Network have made significant investments in this country of 165 million people to lure clients to their services. **********These companies are looking at Brazil's estimated 6.8 million Internet users, which puts the nation behind Australia and ahead of China and France when ranked by number of users, according to Computer Industry Almanac. The number of people using the Internet in Brazil more than doubled this year, with similar growth expected in the next few years. **********Yet while other foreign companies were earlier in initiating Portuguese-language portal sites or dial-up services in a push to compete with domestic companies, AOL was a relatively late arrival. When America Online did establish operations in Brazil as part of a $200 million investment in Latin America with the Cisneros Group of Venezuela, its partner in the region, the company chose to repeat a strategy that helped to build its success in the United States. **********Essentially, this meant slick promotions and the distribution of free CD-ROM installation kits that in some cases altered the characteristics of browsing systems used to navigate the Internet. According to some complaints, the installation software added unexpected customization features to browsers and, in some cases, routed users to America Online as their home page. **********Although AOL officials said that Mr. Loureiro's departure was not related to problems from complaints, it was untimely since the company was in the midst of a major advertising campaign to familiarize Brazilians with its service. **********AOL maintains that the Brazil debut has been the most successful in the company's experience in the United States or other countries, with 65,000 customers signed up so far, and with use by these clients more than twice as much as forecast. **********Moreover, the company has established its entry without resorting to price cuts, although competitors have been rattled enough by the arrival of AOL to cut their prices. AOL charges 35 reais, or about $18, a month. Universo Online, the biggest Internet service provider in Brazil with 600,000 customers, cut its prices from 35 reais to 19.95 reais two days after AOL began service, and smaller providers made similar cuts. **********But America Online's reliance on the CD-ROM software promotion to build a customer base has stumbled. Aside from the installation complaints, AOL learned recently that the Brazilian company that produced the CD-ROM's accidentally released several hundred of them with music by Raca Negra, a rock band, that not all the company's potential customers would necessarily appreciate. **********Charles Herington, the AOL executive who is filling in as head of the Brazilian subsidiary until a replacement for Mr. Loureiro is chosen, said the company was moving fast to limit the damage from its CD-ROM miscues. ''We'll alter our software if that's what's needed,'' Mr. Herington said. ''We're ready to react fast to customer demands.'' **********Compounding AOL's problems in catering to the taste of the Brazilian consumer, the company has been engaged in a yearlong legal battle with a small Internet concern, Curitiba America, in southern Brazil over the rights to its domain name. The case, one of this country's first examples of litigation regarding trademarks and addresses on the World Wide Web, has kept AOL from using the domain name aol.com.br. **********''I don't see the case being resolved for another two years,'' said Luiz Edgard Montaury Pimenta, the lawyer representing AOL."

For many, there was a sense that the treaty may now be dead. **********There are countries that fear American power, and those fears have been heightened by what looks like an American renunciation of any controls over its huge nuclear arsenal. There are also nations that rest secure in the shadow of American might and leadership. For them, the appearance that Americans are  moving away from international agreements and responsibilities can also be alarming. In either case, the Washinton's example is important. **********''If the United States, the sole superpower, refuses stubbornly to ratify a global nuclear test ban treaty that will make the world safer for all, why on earth would any other country want to do it?'' The Straits Times of Singapore asked in an editorial. **********Germany's Defense Minister, Rudolf Scharping, called the Senate's decision ''absolutely wrong,'' and an aide to President Jacques Chirac of France echoed the tone of the comments in Europe when he called the Senate vote on Wednesday night ''a setback to the process of nonproliferation and disarmament.'' **********A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vladimir Rakhmanin, called rejection of the treaty ''a serious blow.'' **********China also registered ''profound regret.'' At a news conference, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Zhang Qiyue, said China remained committed to the treaty and would accelerate its process of studying and then ratifying the treaty. But she gave no timetable. **********The Japanese Foreign Minister, Yohei Kono, said, ''We had hoped for the U.S.'s leadership in nuclear disarmament and in preventing nuclear proliferation, and so the result is very regrettable.'' **********Of the seven acknowledged nuclear weapons countries, only two -- France and Britain -- have ratified the treaty. Russia, the United States and China have only signed it. Israel, which is assumed to have a nuclear weapons program, has also signed.  North Korea, whose nuclear program has caused much nervousness in Asia, has not signed. **********India and Pakistan, both of whom have tested nuclear bombs, have also not signed, and by wide agreement are not now under as much pressure to do so, even though many experts believe that the tensions between these two countries have made their region a potential ground for nuclear conflict. **********''All said and done, the treaty is dead,'' said Brahma Chellaney, a security analyst at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ''Why would other nations move ahead with the treaty. It will just go into limbo. It's not an issue any more. India can just relax now.'' **********Less than a week ago, an international conference in Vienna to discuss how to put the treaty into force reaffirmed support for a pact that delegates called ''internationally and effectively verifiable.'' At the meeting, European and Asian nations urged the United States to ratify the accord. Rejection by the Senate six days later is being interpreted by many diplomats and editorial writers abroad as a direct slap on the face of American allies and friends. **********Richard Butler, the Australian disarmament expert who fought back a challenge from India to win approval of the treaty in the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 and was present when President Clinton signed it soon afterward, called the Senate vote ''a profoundly wrong decision.'' **********''I felt in 1996 that one of the last remaining pieces in a nuclear nonproliferation fabric had been woven,'' said Mr. Butler, a diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ''It is a tapestry. It has in it the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, controls on the export of sensitive material, the atmospheric test ban, under-sea test ban and so on. It had all those filaments.'' **********If testing were banned, Mr. Butler said, the tapestry would be complete ''and we could finally get on with the business of reducing the numbers of weapons, hopefully one day getting down to zero.'' **********Opponents of the treaty continue to argue that there were too many dangerous flaws for it to be acceptable to the United States. Kathleen Bailey, senior associate at the National Institute for Public Policy in Washington and author of a study of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for the Cato Institute, said in an interview that not all nations take international agreements as seriously as Americans do. **********''When the United States signs a treaty, it adheres to its terms rigorously, and we do not cheat,'' said Ms. Bailey, who was assistant director for proliferation at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1987 to 1990. ''Yet we know for a fact that other nations have cheated on arms control treaties or break the norms established by the treaties. The Number 1 example is the nuclear nonpoliferation treaty. North Korea is still in violation of that treaty and has cheated on it. Numerous other nations have done so as well.'' **********''Virtually all arms control treaties have been trampled upon,'' she said. ''Those who question verification don't have any confidence that the Russian, the Chinese or anybody else who sees it their national security interest to test will not do so.'' **********One of the very few foreign leaders to put something of a good face on the Senate vote was Robert Hill, Australia's Environment Minister, who said he understood that the Senators were concerned about any agreement that might weaken the United States in carrying out its ''special global responsibility.'' **********American arms control experts were overwhelmingly critical, among them diplomats who had devoted years to steering this treaty through the United Nations system, only to see their work jettisoned in an evening. **********The Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, a group of 17 independent arms control associations accused the Senate of ''playing petty political games on a matter that effects the survival of the planet.'' **********In Vienna, John B. Ritch 3d, the American representative at the arms control bodies based there, expressed his irritation in an interview. **********''A key aspect of the Senate vote is its effect on the worldwide inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is our first line of defense against proliferation,'' he said. ''In practical terms, the I.A.E.A.'s on-site inspection system is even more important than the test ban since it is aimed at catching a nuclear proliferator well before the point of testing. But politically, the test ban is needed to buttress the nonproliferation treaty. **********''It boils down to this: Not only has the Senate said no to an added line of defense against proliferation; it has also weakened a potent defense barrier we had already constructed.'' **********Except for the Indian and Pakistani nuclear explosions in May 1998, there have been no tests since French tests in 1995 and China's in 1996, just before the test ban treaty was adopted."

Now, the last of the regular American military presence in the capital is set to end in January, with the 400 troops to be replaced by shifts of reservists on short-term training missions throughout the country. **********That is yet another blow for a country that has made dishearteningly little progress despite high expectations -- perhaps unrealistic -- since the invasion. By the end of this year, police trainers and human rights monitors from the United Nations and the Organization of American States are also to leave, although United Nations officials hope to maintain a smaller mission. **********After Jean-Bertrand Aristide, then a radical Roman Catholic priest, was elected in 1990 as Haiti's first democratically chosen president in decades, an army-led coup drove him into exile in 1991. After three years of repression, he was restored to power in a negotiated settlement backed by an American-led occupation. The current president, Rene Preval, was his hand-picked successor, but Mr. Aristide, who resigned from the priesthood in 1994, remains Haiti's leading political figure and is expected to run again next year. **********The American military's role in Haiti has gone from ensuring security to carrying out the kind of work that brings tangible relief to the residents of the hemisphere's poorest nation -- providing free medical care, repairing wells and building schools. While thousands of Haitians have benefited from this assistance, countless more have taken psychological comfort from the mere presence of the American troops. **********On a recent day, Anes Anis came home from her factory job to find an American soldier sitting behind his M-60 machine gun atop a Humvee while another paced the side of her hilly dirt street. She said she welcomed those silent sentries. **********''We're happy to see them,'' she said. ''If something happens now, we could call on them. Otherwise, we have nothing at all to protect us.'' **********But the soldiers were not there to bring peace to her neighborhood. They had only come to secure the area while dozens of American sailors painted a local schoolhouse. **********Like Ms. Anis, many Haitians hoped that the intervention would solve day-to-day problems. The departing forces leave behind a nation that is still trying to create a democratic, functioning state. **********The Haitian Army was disbanded but not disarmed, contributing to an increase in street and drug crimes. While a new police force struggles to enforce the law, a dysfunctional judiciary has hampered its efforts. People and cars crowd the streets in midday, but few people venture out very early or late, lest they become targets for bandits. **********Foreign investment has been a trickle. With unemployment hovering at 60 percent, factory owners have been closing up as clients shift orders to nations with equally cheap labor but more stability. **********With regularity, residents in some neighborhoods vent their frustration and try to get the government's attention by hauling tires and trash into the street and setting up flaming roadblocks. **********It has hardly helped. The government itself has been virtually paralyzed since 1997 while Mr. Preval fought with his opposition in Parliament over his choice for prime minister. He finally appointed a de facto prime minister earlier this year when the Parliament's term ended, leaving the nation without a functioning legislature. **********Throughout the standoff, the government failed to pass either a budget or laws that would have brought $500 million in international aid to shore up its crumbling infrastructure and reduce suffering. **********Legislative elections have been pushed back from December of this year to March 19, prompting fears of campaign fraud or violence. International observers and diplomats have accused supporters of Mr. Aristide of trying to wrest control of the civilian police force to use it for their political advantage. Recently, a daylong voter education event sponsored by the national electoral council was disrupted by hecklers. **********The governmental paralysis has disappointed both Haitians and other countries, which are coming to realize that they also had unrealistic expectations. **********Decades of dictatorship under Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, left the country with scant experience with democratic rule. Now, as Haiti continues the transition to democracy that it began when Duvalier rule ended in 1986, other nations say that they are  willing to help but that the Haitian people must take the initiative. **********''The real challenge is for Haitians to come together and address their past so they can come up with answers that will help them create their future,'' said the American ambassador, Timothy Carney. ''The political culture has got to change.'' **********The years since the intervention have brought some improvements. The United States, working through private contractors and nongovernmental organizations, has provided $300 million for health care, education and judicial reform. Inflation has been reduced to single-digit figures, and the currency is stable. **********Most important, the leaders of a coup that had ousted Mr. Aristide and ushered in years of repression were removed. Diplomats say the nation's human rights record has improved and individual freedoms have grown. **********The formation of the Haitian National Police from 5,300 mostly raw recruits has also been seen as a positive development, although the force is hampered by insufficient resources and inexperienced mid-level commanders. Since its inception three years ago, more than 800 officers have been dismissed for offenses ranging from corruption to human rights violations. Yet even that is seen as evidence that it is willing to ensure its integrity by rooting out malfeasance. **********''On the human rights side, clearly a number of things have improved,'' said Colin Granderson, the executive director of the United Nations/Organization of American States International Civilian Mission in Haiti. ''There is an emphasis on accountability, which was unheard of before. Serious human rights violations are no longer a policy of the authorities.'' **********But with every advance there have been setbacks that make Haiti, in the words of one diplomat, ''a country of push-pull doors.'' While the police have been trying to enforce the law, they have been stymied by an inept and backlogged judiciary: about 80 percent of all Haitian prisoners are awaiting trial. A school supported by international donors has been training judges, and the government recently increased judges' salaries to make them less susceptible to bribes. But some feel that the reforms did not address the fundamental flaw. **********''The problem is we're still functioning with an old justice system we inherited from the days of the military dictatorship,'' said Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis. **********He added that despite the obstacles, the administration was able to carry out some programs. Land reform has reduced supply costs for farmers. Cooperatives have been established, he said. And while the pace has been slow, the government is privatizing the operations of ports and the airport. **********But much more could have been accomplished had it not been for the paralysis that overtook the government shortly after the 1997 Parliamentary elections. Members of the opposition, the Organization of People in Struggle, accused the governing Lavalas Party of fraud. For two years, they blocked Mr. Preval's choice for Prime Minister, and accomplished little else, said diplomats and international officials. **********The deadlock has frozen $500 million in loans from the Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank and other institutions. **********''A lot of that money is going to be lost,'' Mr. Granderson said. ''That money is not going to be held for Haitians until they make up their minds that they're ready to use it. The window is closing.'' **********The fatigue felt by donors is shared by ordinary Haitians. Craters filled with mud and putrid sewage cover long stretches of the National Highway, which runs past the sprawling slums of Cite Soleil. **********''This is the government's problem,'' said Israel Domones, on a recent day after he hit a hole and the bottom of his tractor-trailer, filled with sacks of flour, fell out, causing a huge traffic jam. ''The water is deep and I did not see how big the hole was. The road is stuck. The country is stuck.'' **********When the Americans first invaded Haiti in 1915, they stayed long enough to build up the country's infrastructure. This time, their focus has been  on aid, like the free clinics where hundreds of Haitians line up for hours to receive medical care. **********The military has also built many schools and repaired wells. The American soldiers speak enthusiastically about their mission, but they also admit that the nation's impoverished social conditions can seem overwhelming. **********''Do they need roads or water now, or do they need education?'' said Lt. Comdr. Joseph Larry of the Navy, the American military support group's chief engineer. ''It's a tough nut to crack as to what Haiti needs more of.'' **********There is also little time remaining for elections, which are seen as the only way out of the government's paralysis. ''People are clamoring for elections to take place as soon as possible so we can get back to a government of parliamentary normalcy,'' Mr. Alexis said. ''Democracy cannot be decreed. It can only be built.'' **********With only four months to go, the logistical obstacles are daunting in a country where phone lines, electricity and other basics are unreliable. **********Some diplomats and Haitians fear that the elections could be delayed again, possibly combined with the presidential elections scheduled for next November. They say supporters of Mr. Aristide favor that possibility, hoping to use his coattails to win seats in Parliament. **********Diplomats and international observers also worry about reports of  intimidation by Aristide supporters and reports they they are trying to gain control of the police. **********Yvon Neptune, a spokesman for Mr. Aristide's party, denied those accusations. ''We hope the election schedule is going to be kept,'' he said.  Much is at stake in the coming elections, and not just the return of a functioning, daily government. The country is at a point where it is being urged to find a national consensus on how government can work for all sectors of Haitian society. **********''The government itself has been the situation, in their total lack of management, vision and honesty,'' said Georges Sassine, an apparel factory owner and vice president of the Association of Haitian Industries. ''You feel there are 200 different governments and within each branch you have sub-branches and they all go their separate ways. I'm not going to call it anarchy. Yet.'' **********He spoke inside his vast, empty factory, where he had just laid off 260 workers. While the government has been paralyzed, orders from the United States dried up. In the last two months, 22 factories have closed, leaving nearly 5,000 people jobless, he said. Some people have done well, including those who have taken advantage of government inaction and desperate poverty to make fast money in contraband, he said. But most are still waiting. **********''Haiti has not learned there is no individual salvation,'' Mr. Sassine said. ''If you're in a sinking boat and you jump out, are you really saved? It's either everybody gets saved or nobody does.''"

Francisco Barreto, a prominent voice for moderation in the territory. The agency's office in Australia said that several other Caritas workers had also apparently been killed. **********The Carter Center, the human rights and diplomacy organization based in Atlanta, reported that a well-known nun had been killed in Dili. And in another report, the Rev. Jose Carbonel of the Silesian order said in Jakarta that six nuns of the Canossian order had been killed in the city of Baucau, where the Roman Catholic Bishop, Basilio do Nascimento, was reported on Wednesday to have been wounded and forced to flee into the hills. **********On Monday, armed militias burned the home of Bishop Carlos Belo, who fled to Australia. There also are numerous reports of churches being burned. **********East Timorese exiles also said that the militias had killed the 82-year-old father of Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the pro-independence leader who was released three days ago after seven years of detention. **********Early today the United Nations began its planned evacuation of the bulk of its staff in Dili, the capital of East Timor, leaving behind about 100 officials to maintain a presence. **********In one possible sign that some order was being restored, Indonesian troops were reported on Thursday to be helping to resupply the besieged United Nations office. **********With military-backed militias destroying the territory's communications system and forcing the departure of most journalists and other outsiders, reports of massacres and terror were difficult to verify. **********A delegation of five representatives to the United Nations met with President B. J. Habibie on Thursday and received a new promise that Indonesia would act to curb the militias, which have been killing, burning and looting for nearly a week. **********In Auckland, New Zealand, today Jose Ramos-Horta, a leader of the Timorese independence movement, said he would tell leaders at an Asia-Pacific economic forum that intervention was necessary to stop the killing in East Timor. **********''If the international community does not stop it in the next few hours, tens of thousands of people will be dying -- dying from killing, dying from starvation,'' he said. **********As international pressure on Indonesia intensified, the Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, admitted that the military command in Jakarta had lost control of the situation in East Timor, a tiny territory of 800,000 people, which Indonesia invaded in 1975. The violence there intensified after the announcement on Saturday that the East Timorese people had voted by nearly 80 percent, in an independence referendum on Aug. 30. **********''The military as an institution, the police as an institution, are not in support of the people burning and killing and looting,'' Mr. Alatas said. ''These are criminal activities, and we are going to put a stop to it.'' **********This is not a new promise. Elements of the military and police have openly aided and participated in the violence and in an extraordinary campaign of forced migration that has driven out some 200,000 people. **********Mr. Alatas denied that people were being forced to leave, and called the reports of relief organizations and witnesses ''nonsense.'' **********''These people want to go to safer places, and we are helping them,'' he said. **********Some were being corralled in camps in the neighboring Indonesian territory of West Timor, where armed militias continued to keep them under control and prevent foreigners from talking to them. Others were being put aboard ferries and sent to distant islands. **********Members of the United Nations delegation met with Mr. Habibie Thursday and said he agreed to let them visit Dili on Saturday. **********''We expressed our concerns very strongly about the continuing humanitarian problems and the bloodshed in East Timor,'' said Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British representative to the United Nations, who is a member of the delegation. **********An official traveling with the United Nations mission described the meeting with the President as a ''reality check.'' **********''It was clear that Indonesia's perception of what is going on in East Timor is quite different to the rest of the world,'' he said. **********Indonesia's position is that reports from East Timor have been exaggerated, that there is no organized campaign of killings and arson, and that no one is being forced out. **********A smuggled videotape from Dili, filmed three days ago, showed a city in ruins, its buildings smashed and scarred, its streets littered with abandoned vehicles but empty of people, and its sky filled with dense smoke from burning buildings. **********But there were reports from Dili that the violence there had ebbed. **********Supporting this view, the chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sudrajat, told reporters on Thursday: ''There has been an improvement. Generally the burning has stopped, although clouds of smoke were still seen rising from certain pockets. Hopefully within two or three days all public facilities will resume as normal, and by next week the situation would be fully restored.''"

Already this year, two senior officers investigating the group, known by its acronym, Pagad, have been gunned down from passing cars, one fatally. **********Superintendent Holtzhausen, the spokesman for the continuing investigation, has been assigned bodyguards, but they are not always around. The police headquarters here was bombed Jan. 28. Pagad is suspected, but denies it. In this police office building -- thanks to bravado, tight budgets and puzzling management decisions that characterize the force -- nobody bothers to stop visitors wandering the halls. **********''They won't walk into my office to get me,'' Superintendent Holtzhausen insisted. ''They definitely don't have the heart for that. They're not suicide-bomber types. **********''I wish they would, though,'' he added, grinning to break the tension of discussing the chances of his own assassination. ''I'm ready for them.'' **********Cape Town, which once had a crime rate far lower than Johannesburg's, is now a city in a three-way war between the vigilantes of Pagad,  drug gangs that have become powerful during the last five years, and the police. Last year, there were 529 drive-by shootings and 79 pipe bombings in the Western Cape province, which includes the city, the vast mixed-race Cape Flats neighborhoods east of it, and many quiet beach and farming towns. **********Many of South Africa's 500,000 Muslims live in the Cape Flats, most  descended from Malay slaves imported by the Dutch East India company in the 17th and 18th centuries. **********Pagad is suspected of killing more than 25 drug dealers and a police captain, Bennie Lategan, and of wounding a police superintendent, Schalk Visagie. And it is suspected of bombing, along with the police headquarters, several smaller station houses, a synagogue and a Planet Hollywood restaurant. **********The restaurant attack was last August, just after the United States fired cruise missiles into Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the bombings of two American Embassies. But no one has been convicted, so the authorities are careful not to  accuse the group publicly. **********Pagad's representatives deny the accusations but hedge as they do. Abieda Roberts and Ebrahim Francis, who are on its governing committee, were asked in a joint interview if Pagad had shot officers and bombed stations. Both answered in virtually the same words, ''No -- as far as we're concerned.'' Mrs. Roberts added quickly, ''It's never been Pagad policy to attack police stations and policemen.'' **********Asked if the police were right in saying that Pagad's armed wing, the G-Force, is never directly ordered to kill but interprets the lists of enemies read out at the mosque as targets, they answered: ''We can't speak on behalf of the G-Force. We can't tell you how they interpret it.'' **********''It isn't policy to kill,'' Mrs. Roberts added. ''But if people decide to go out there and kill, it doesn't mean the leadership is responsible.'' **********Three years ago, when Pagad first appeared in the crime-ridden Cape Flats, it had a Wyatt Earp status. It could rally 5,000 people at midnight to march from one drug dealer's house to another, following a masked leader called The Emir who would be flanked by masked guards. **********Dealers were given an ultimatum: confess at the Gatesville mosque and quit the trade -- or die. Sometimes warnings were spray-painted on their walls; sometimes gasoline bombs were thrown against them. **********In August 1996, in a moment caught by a television crew and broadcast around the world, a gang leader named Rashaad Staggie, who was shoving through a crowd around his house, was beaten, shot dead and set on fire. [His twin brother, Rashied, who took over the leadership of the gang, was wounded late this month in a drive-by shooting.] **********Many citizens said they were sad that it took vigilantes to clean up the area, but they agreed with Pagad that the police were at best inept and at worst in the pay of the dealers who ran the Hard Livings, the Americans, the Sexy Boys and other gangs. **********But these days, a Pagad march on a warm Sunday is lucky to get 500 people. A recent one drew only 80. **********One reason is that misdirected violence has shriveled public respect. The Planet Hollywood bomb -- which Mrs. Roberts specifically denied was Pagad's work, but which the group is still suspected of carrying out -- blew off the leg of an 8-year-old British girl. A drive-by shooting apparently aimed at a greengrocer believed to sell drugs killed his 4-year-old daughter, whose angelic face was on front pages the next day. Another baby was killed when the wrong house was firebombed. **********A second reason for Pagad's falling popularity is that it now openly rejects the Government. Crime analysts, the police and local journalists say it was taken over in 1997 by Qibla, an older Islamic fundamentalist group. But Pagad's leaders say they do not endorse an Islamic revolution here -- a quixotic idea anyway, since less than two percent of South Africa is Muslim. ''We're not stupid,'' Mrs. Roberts said. **********Still, Mr. Francis added: ''We object to facets of the Constitution. Like abortion, like no death penalty, like this distorted sense of human rights that lets gangsters walk free. We want a moral basis to society.'' **********The two contended that ''police intimidation,'' not their own loss of touch with the people, has caused Pagad's rallies to shrink. **********But the rallies have also become  dangerous. One on Jan. 8 protesting a visit by Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, turned into a shootout inside clouds of tear gas. The police  contend that Pagad was handing out guns, so officers opened fire with rubber bullets; Pagad says that some used live ammunition. One Pagad member was killed and other demonstrators were injured. **********Although police informants clearly attend rallies and mosque meetings, the G-Force itself resists infiltration. Peter Gastrow, an analyst at the Institute for Security Studies, a local research group, said that it consists  of cells of a few men whose names are known only to one another and who get their targets not through a chain of command but from the lists read out at the mosque. **********But it is possible that the police have finally made a dent in the group. On Jan. 27, extra officers and soldiers began pouring into Cape Town for a police drive against terrorism called Operation Good Hope. The bomb at police headquarters, at Caledon Square, went off the next day, as the operation's leaders were meeting nearby. The bomb injured 11 pedestrians. **********Within two weeks, the police had arrested what they think are two G-Force cells. First, they stopped six men in a car at midnight and found  guns and a videotape showing police stations. Two days later, five more men, also armed, were arrested driving down from Johannesburg. **********Police officials say that one member of the second group is an informant for South Africa's National Intelligence Agency and that they believe the five planned to blow up Parliament as President Nelson Mandela addressed it. The intelligence agency says that Cape Town Muslim militants are being trained in the Middle East by Hezbollah, or Party of God, the Lebanese guerrilla group. **********Little evidence backing those claims has been released so far, and the police and intelligence agents are feuding over how the information got out. **********But, as one local journalist who used to cover Pagad put it, ''It's been dead quiet since they busted those two groups.''"

With an average $7,000 credit limit, the typical platinum card is not even up to buying a round-trip ticket to Paris on the Concorde. **********But now American Express faces serious competition for the charge card business of the rich, whose numbers are growing along with the stock market, from a variety of financial services businesses. **********Last year, Visa introduced Signature Rewards through three issuers; the move came shortly after Mastercard started offering its Worldcard. Both, like all American Express cards, have no preset spending limits. The industry calls them ''prestige cards,'' and they come with perks that David Fanger, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said ''are designed to target American Express Platinum customers.'' **********The most serious challenge to American Express Platinum is coming from Merrill Lynch, the world's largest securities broker. In just seven months, Merrill has opened 370,000 Visa Signature accounts. After 15 years, American Express has 500,000 Platinum accounts, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter in Oxnard, Calif. **********The Merrill card is cheaper -- $75 a year, versus $300 for American Express Platinum. But cost is not these customers' sole consideration. And Merrill's card is offered only with the broker's Cash Management Account, which requires a $20,000 opening deposit and bundles together money market, mutual fund and stock and bond investments in a monthly statement. **********Which prestige card has the best perks depends on an individual's needs -- and a close reading of the fine print. **********American Express promotes the free companion tickets -- at the front of the plane -- that Platinum card holders get every time they fly overseas and pay with their cards. But the deal is good only on Continental Airlines and 15 foreign airlines. And companion tickets are good only from so-called gateway cities. If you own a business based in New York or San Francisco and travel a lot, the deal is incredible. But if you live in, say, Buffalo, you have to transport your companion to New York, Chicago or some other big city on your own dime before the free travel kicks in. **********Platinum holders also earn points -- one for each dollar charged -- that never expire and can be transferred to the frequent-flier programs of six domestic airlines and a variety of foreign airlines. But the biggest domestic carriers, United and American, are not in the program. **********Merrill's Visa Signature card lacks the companion ticket deal, and its points expire after five years. But they are more flexible. For 25,000 points, Merrill card holders get a ticket worth up to $500 whether they are flying to Rome, N.Y., or Rome, Italy. If a ticket costs $600, they just pay the extra $100. The points are good on any airline, and there are no blackout periods. **********For 100,000 points, Signature promises a first-class ticket on ''any airline anywhere in the world at any time.'' But unless you have $10 million in your Cash Management Account, the fine print limits the ticket's value to $2,000. **********Still, card industry experts say the new prestige cards offer great advantages for customers. But what's in it for issuers like Merrill? Profits -- or maybe even survival. **********Merrill is fighting to hang onto its 4.8 million customers as free investment advice spreads over the Internet and its clients are lured by discount brokers and on-line brokerage services with lower trading commissions. **********So it is venturing into a business long associated with commercial banks to try to tighten its hold on a high-end clientele. **********''We view Signature as a relationship product and a way to reward our best clients,'' said Nancy Kelly, Merrill's vice president for credit card marketing. **********Merrill also hopes its Signature customers will keep more money in their Cash Management Accounts to cover their credit card charges. Merrill pays about 4 percent interest to clients on the idle funds in their accounts. But it invests that money for its own account and charges 8.5 percent interest on unpaid balances, while tapping the account for monthly payments. **********Merrill has already linked the Cash Management Accounts to an Internet site where clients can conduct securities transactions and pay bills. Soon, it plans to offer services like bill presentation, in which bills from the phone company, the gas station and other vendors can be paid on line. **********Other brokerage firms are expected to offer Visa Signature or the Mastercard Worldcard as a tool to build loyalty among customers with lots of investable assets, said Chris N. Theoharides, president of Advantage Consulting Group in Massapequa, N.Y., a credit card consulting firm. **********''The other brokerage houses are seeing a lot of merit in the Merrill card,'' he said, ''and they are all a little concerned about a competitor having that one valuable product that will draw customers away.'' **********Brokerage firms can afford to lose money on Signature and Worldcard, he said, if they bring in significantly more brokerage fees or protect market share over all. **********Worldcard, being offered by Chase Manhattan, First USA, Bank of America and other banks, provides basic benefits that are similar to Signature's. But issuers of either card can add benefits: Merrill, for example, will airlift a card holder home in a medical emergency if necessary, while basic Signature and Worldcard members get free transportation to the nearest medical facility. **********Merrill and others add features based on the potential profits from their affluent customers, said William F. Keenan, president of the Denovo Corporation, a marketing research firm in Hockessin, Del. **********In the long run, David Robertson, president of Nilson, is skeptical about how well the new competitors will do against American Express Platinum. And Ms. Rankin of American Express said, ''People have tried throughout the years to copycat us, but we are the first and the best. Period.'' **********Still, Merrill's new card is a virtually risk-free way for the broker to lend money. **********When a Platinum customer goes broke, American Express becomes an unsecured creditor near the end of the line in court. But Signature balances are margin loans against the customer's brokerage account. **********So Merrill's Visa is not unlike the cards banks issue to bankrupts -- a secured credit card for the rich."

A leader of the General Workers Union in Spain, Juan Sanchez, said the banks' management had promised what he called a civilized reduction of jobs through early retirements."

It is quite a hike, actually, four to eight hours depending on the strength of the climber and whether he or she is bringing along sacrificial goats or chickens. **********But the word of mouth about Manakamana has always been quite good, and, as one might expect of a deity who makes dreams come true, she is a big draw. Despite the temple's location in the remote Himalayas 70 miles west of Katmandu, some 350,000 of the pious have been making the arduous up-and-down trek every year. **********Inevitably, 20th-century entrepreneurs would take note of such heavy attendance. After doing the requisite market research, a Nepalese corporation, Chitawon Construction and Engineering Company, built a modern sky ride last year with 31 cable cars to do the climbing up the 4,000-foot-high mountainside. It has cut the time of the once strenuous pilgrimage to a fleet eight and a half minutes. **********Since November, when the $6.4 million ride made its debut, traffic to the temple has nearly doubled, and the wish of its builders is coming true with windfall profits. Annual per capita income in Nepal is only $210, but people have been willing to pay $4 for the round trip. **********Sacrificial goats require only a one-way fare, of course. That charge is $2. Chickens ride free. **********''More people means more prayers and devotion, and that is a very good thing,'' said Insan Bahadur Thapa Magar, the high priest of the shrine, which is a small, pagoda-style structure with two roofs and an overhang of finely crafted wooden filigree. **********Twenty-one generations ago, Mr. Magar's ancestor, Lakhan Thapa, was the only mortal who knew of the goddess's divine presence. So the story goes, Manakamana had taken the human form of the Queen of Ghorka. When the King died, she did her wifely duty and threw herself on his funeral pyre according to the Hindu tradition of suttee. **********With the body of his goddess consumed by fire, Lakhan Thapa became inconsolable. To end his grief, Manakamana promised to reappear in another form one day. **********A few months later a local farmer plowing his field cleaved a stone and watched in awe as blood and milk poured out onto the ground. When Lakhan Thapa heard of it, he immediately presumed that Manakamana had come back in the mundane guise of a rock. He built a shrine on the site so that others could also have their wishes come true. **********''The goddess has saved me from trouble time and again,'' said Mahesh Mittal, 32, a prosperous businessman who has been going to the temple for five years. ''I told Manakamana that if my wish was fulfilled, I would keep returning, and she has never failed me.'' **********Hinduism is so elastic a religion that the beliefs of one Hindu may be unrecognizable to another. In Nepal, which is officially a Hindu kingdom, people frequently say they have 33 million gods and goddesses, which is an ample supply for 23 million people. Of these divinities, some, like Manakamana, are regarded with special affection. **********''I am a very poor farmer from a very poor village,'' said Lok Nath Bhusal, 32, who had made a long journey to visit the goddess for the first time. ''My family lives hand to mouth, and maybe Manakamana will give us better crops. If she does this, I have promised her that I will sacrifice two chickens.'' **********This is a common pattern -- waiting for the wish to come true before investing in the animal sacrifice. Practicality governs this spiritual transaction. Faith is not in short supply, but achieved results are what matters most. **********Although the cable cars have speeded up travel to the temple, there is little to be done about the sluggish line to enter the door. Worshipers go inside one at a time, kneel before an icon and respond to the priest who asks, ''What are your special wishes?'' **********They leave with a handful of flowers and coconut held on a plate made from the leaf of a sal tree. Donations are expected. **********With all this wishing done on a one-on-one basis, there is often a 90-minute wait. The people in line, like the goddess herself, seem to span the oceans of time. Some are peasants whose threadbare clothing could have come out of a 17th-century laundry basket. Others sport Tommy Hilfiger jackets and DKNY handbags. **********Worshipers are understandably timid to discuss what they want from Manakamana, fretting that this might interfere with a wish's fulfillment. Supplicants who are less shy speak of exams that must be passed, better jobs that would bring better pay, reluctant lovers whose hearts need the nudge of further enchantment. Others favor the full coverage of a more omnibus request, flat out asking for the gift of total happiness. **********As they await their turns to enter the temple, the worshipers stand in a courtyard that overloads the senses. Bells are festively clanging. Flames are fluttering atop hundreds of candles. Incense seasons the breezes. Flags are flapping. Vendors hawk trinkets and freshly fried bread. Flocks of pigeons peck at the ground. Packs of dogs chase one another. **********At the temple itself, one man with a huge knife is doing the sacrifices. Small pools of blood accumulate beside the front porch. Newly beheaded chickens are carried away, their twitching bodies yet to fully comprehend the deadly news. Bleating goats, their horns consecrated with vermilion, are led to a chopping block. Their slit throats erupt with a sudden spray. **********''It is quite a sight, isn't it?'' said K. P. Shrestha, an electrical engineer who professed to have ''too scientific a mind'' to believe in the powers of Manakamana. **********He did arrive from Katmandu with a dear wish, however. And he was extremely pleased at its fulfillment. **********He had come to go up the mountain in the marvelous new cable car."

Just ask Laurence Fishburne. **********During a performance of ''The Lion in Winter'' at New York's Roundabout Theater last month, Mr. Fishburne suddenly stepped out of character and growlingly upbraided a man in the audience whose cell phone had been ringing for half a minute. The play resumed only after a long, loud ovation. **********But gentle or ungentle reminders from actors, not to mention librarians, symphony conductors, maitres d'hotel and other public shushers, have so far not succeeded in keeping America's 60 million-odd cell phones (and their owners) from making nuisances of themselves. **********Now, though, a small company in Israel is offering a technological fix: a device about the size of a cigar box called C-Guard Cellular Firewall, which is said to block cell phones within a hundred-yard radius from sending or receiving calls. It is a cure that may prove as controversial as the disease. **********The company, Netline Technologies Ltd. of Tel Aviv, sells the Firewall over the Internet for roughly $1,000. The device detects the activity of any nearby wireless device and emits bursts of static on the same radio frequency. Cell phones in its area of influence report ''no service'' or ''signal not available'' to their owners, and incoming calls do not get through. **********''Every medicine has side effects, and so does cellular service,'' said Netline's vice president, Gil Israeli, one of the Firewall's designers and a retired Israeli military officer. ''We are simply offering a pill that reduces those side effects.'' **********But irritating chatter and ill-timed rings were not the side effects that prompted Netline to develop the device; security lapses were. ''Some years ago, several officers were having a meeting,'' Mr. Israeli recalled. ''One of my colleagues sat on his cell phone, which pushed the 'send' button. He had dialed someone who listened in on our entire conversation, a very sensitive conversation. Luckily, it was another officer.'' **********Unluckily for Netline, cell-phone jamming runs afoul of the Federal Communications Commission, whose approval is required for devices that send signals over the air. ''We would not authorize a device that's intended to deliberately interfere with authorized radio services,'' said a senior commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity. **********The specter of deliberate dead zones worries the cell phone industry. ''If one of our members learns that jamming equipment is in use, the F.C.C. will find out about it in short order,'' said Geoffrey Nelson, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, who cited the 98,000 emergency 911 calls his group reckons are made on cell phones daily. **********And experts say anyone who installs a C-Guard Cellular Firewall would be skating on thin legal ice. Under Federal law, interfering with legal over-the-air communication is punishable by fines of up to $11,000 and a year in prison for each incident. **********But Mr. Israeli argues that there is a sound defense for his company's device, if not under current law, then under broader American principles. ''When cellular operators were awarded a license to exclusively use frequency bands, no permission was granted to invade one's private property and disturb the rightful owner,'' Mr. Israeli said. ''Just as anyone is entitled to remove a trespasser who causes damage, an owner is entitled to use C-Guard to protect himself from nuisance.'' **********Mr. Israeli, who asserted that the device had been sold to American customers but would not name them, said his company did not rule out challenging the F.C.C. in court. In the meantime, he said, ''We are optimistic that many enlightened countries will accept C-Guard as beneficial.'' Last June, Japan said it would accept applications for licenses to install such devices. **********Legal issues aside, restaurants might seem a fertile market for the Firewall, both because loud phone conversations can ruin the mood and because of the profits from in-house pay phones. But restaurateurs are divided on the device's desirability. **********Danny Meyer, who owns several Manhattan luxury restaurants including the Union Square Cafe and the Gramercy Tavern, loves the idea of cellular-free dining.

(Last year's figures were adjusted as if the merger, which closed last fall, had already occurred.) **********To put that performance in perspective, Citigroup earned more in the quarter than many other financial services companies, such as J. P. Morgan & Company, are likely to earn all year. Its Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit, just one component of Citigroup, earned more in the quarter than Merrill Lynch & Company did in its entirety in the same quarter. **********Citigroup also produced revenue gains more robust than many of its competitors; demonstrated that it has expenses under control; is getting solid returns from its investment banking unit after reducing some of the riskier parts of that business, and already appears to have begun moving beyond the managerial and operational problems that plagued it last year. **********Nonetheless, many companies with big trading and securities operations have been benefiting from an unusually quick and robust turnaround from the volatility that afflicted international markets last year. The BankAmerica Corporation, which posted strong earnings gains yesterday, was also the beneficiary of outsized trading gains. Because of that, some analysts were quick to sound a note of caution about Citigroup's results. **********''This quarter's numbers, while great, don't yet speak to the integration of the company,'' said David Berry, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. ''The question is how reproducible it will be going forward. It's often a mistake to annualize quarterly results if part of it involves trading.'' **********Analysts had been expecting Citigroup to generate earnings of 87 cents a share, according to consensus estimates compiled by the First Call Corporation. In a tough day of trading for most financial services stocks, Citigroup's shares fell $1, or 1.4 percent, to $70.625 yesterday, but still closed well above their 52-week low of $28.50. **********Citigroup's operating earnings, excluding a one-time gain of $74 million related to the reversal of a reorganization charge and a one-time charge of $127 million for accounting changes, were $2.42 billion, up 12 percent from $2.16 billion last year. That also represented a solid rebound from Citigroup's dismal fourth quarter, when it posted operating earnings of $1.4 billion. Revenue in the first quarter was $14.5 billion, up 15 percent from $12.6 billion last year. **********Citigroup is one of the most far-flung financial services companies overseas and John S. Reed, the company's co-chief executive, said in an interview that despite relatively calmer financial conditions abroad many countries ''want to grow and they're being starved for capital.'' He said most Latin American and Eastern European corporations are fundamentally sound, while Asian borrowers, particularly South Korean chaebols and state-owned enterprises in China, are still larded with bad debt. **********But Mr. Reed also noted that much of the world is still in recession or facing the threat of recession. ''The great risk is that the U.S. economy is the only one that is doing well,'' he said. **********Income from Citigroup's global consumer business, which includes insurance banking and credit card products, rose 33 percent, to $1.05 billion. Income from the global corporate business, which includes investment banking, brokerage services, commercial lending, emerging markets and property and casualty insurance, climbed 31 percent, to $1.36 billion. The asset management unit's income rose 16 percent, to $80 million. **********On the downside, Citigroup saw income from investment activities drop 77 percent, to $93 million, on lower debt sales and proprietary investment gains. Its net loss on E-Citi, a research and development unit focused on electronic commerce, widened 20 percent, to $36 million, because of increased spending. **********BankAmerica, the second-biggest financial services concern in the country after Citigroup, also posted impressive first-quarter results yesterday. **********BankAmerica, based in Charlotte, N.C., also the product of one of last year's biggest mergers, said earnings in the quarter rose 44 percent, to $1.91 billion, or $1.08 a diluted share, from $1.33 billion, or 75 cents a share, last year. **********Analysts had expected the bank to post earnings of $1.03 a share. BankAmerica's shares, caught in the decline of financial stocks, fell $1.25, or 1.7 percent, to $71.75, up from their 52-week low of $44. **********BankAmerica's results benefited from $500 million worth of trading revenue, a figure the bank candidly noted was ''unsustainably high.'' Thomas Theurkauf, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette, said investors might have sold Citigroup and BankAmerica shares yesterday because trading played such a crucial role in their earnings gains. **********''The trick for BankAmerica is to replace these more volatile trading revenue with more core revenue growth during the rest of the year,''  Mr. Theurkauf said. **********Besides trading, BankAmerica, which saw total revenue in the quarter drop 4 percent, to $7.8 billion from $8.1 billion a year ago, also attributed its improved profits to better expense controls and strong loan growth matched by improved credit quality. **********The company's investment banking unit, Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, saw profits plunge 37 percent, to $388 million from $613 million last year. But the bank said it expects a recovery in that business, which was hammered by last fall's market downturn and by a heavy exodus of employees from the division. **********--------------------        Bank of New York Profit **********(Reuters) -- The Bank of New York Company said yesterday that its profit rose more than 10 percent in the first quarter to a record high, meeting market expectations amid strong revenue growth from fee-based businesses. **********The bank said net income was $316 million, or 41 cents a diluted share, compared with $284 million, or 36 cents a share, in the first quarter a year earlier. Analysts had forecast earnings of 41 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. **********Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis edged up to $436 million from $404 million in the quarter a year earlier, while noninterest income rose to $625 million from $553 million. **********Fees from securities servicing businesses, such as securities lending and mutual funds, rose 27 percent, to $291 million."

But no one waxed nostalgic for the good old 1980's. **********Instead, a collective sigh could be heard as RJR, a symbol of that era's daring experiment in financial engineering, began its transformation back into two companies, as was the case 14 years ago. **********The leveraged buyouts of that decade -- when financiers like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company took over established companies using immense issues of high-yield debt, hoping to whittle them into lean operations and sell them for a profit -- did little for the target companies. According to KDP Investment Advisors, a Montpelier, Vt., research firm, of the 25 cases between 1985 and 1989 where companies were saddled with more than $1 billion in high-yield debt, almost half defaulted on their loans. Even more filed for bankruptcy or sold off substantial assets. Meanwhile, bond holders who got stuck with the junk watched its value drop. **********''It was called 'the Debacle,' '' said Kingman Penniman, president of KDP, referring to the number of companies that could not pay their debts. ''A lot of these investors were not creators of new companies.'' **********The debacle was due, in part, to a slowing domestic economy early in the 1990's. Companies burdened with billions in loans and faltering earnings stumbled under the strain -- perhaps most notably RJR Nabisco, which might have split up sooner, or grown its food business faster, were it not for its big interest payments, among other things. Many debt-laden companies emerged as more efficient operations, but not without great personal and social costs. **********Still, companies and investors learned several lessons. And experts say it is questionable whether the United States market will again see the types of deals that were common a decade ago. The percentage of junk bonds borrowed by leveraged-buyout firms hovers at 15 percent of all high-yield offerings, said Dwight Sipprelle, co-head of global high-yield operations at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, down from 50 percent peak levels in the 1980's. **********Companies today are less apt to borrow without good reason. ''It's cheaper for companies to issue stock than debt,'' Mr. Penniman said -- though, of course, interest rates are lower on today's junk bonds. And corporate managers have greater personal incentives, in the form of stock option packages, to increase shareholder value. **********BOND issuers, too, have become more disciplined as the high-yield market has matured. ''Some things are just too risky and won't get done,'' Mr. Sipprelle said. Still, high-yield debt is one of the few remaining investments that can deliver double-digit returns, so many investors will snap up bonds representing even the most aggressive financing. **********Another change from the 1980's is that corporations are now more likely to use junk bonds to finance expansion as well as  acquisitions, particularly in hot growth areas like telecommunications, cable and media. This harkens back to the period before the leveraged-buyout boom, when respected companies like MCI Communications and Time Warner used junk bonds to jump-start their growth in the late 1970's and early 1980's. **********Viatel, a fledgling global long-distance provider that went public in 1996, borrowed $900 million through high-yield debt in 1998 and is raising more money that way to help expand its network. **********Of course, consolidation, the major theme in this decade's merger wave, is still a driver of the leveraged market. Last week, Allied Waste Industries, along with two financial buyout firms, announced a friendly acquisition of the trash hauler Browning-Ferris Industries, financed in part by borrowing $9.5 billion. **********Europe, too, is discovering American-style merger financing. Consider Olivetti's $60 billion hostile bid for Telecom Italia. Such a bold move would have been unthinkable a few years ago, in part because continental Europe essentially had no high-yield market. **********So what is the biggest risk in this era's high-yield lending? The same one that caused the last debacle: a downturn in the economy or an industry. **********''When the stock market is humming along, things are great,'' said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance in the graduate school of business at the University of Chicago. ''The risk is -- and this has not yet been tested in this market -- if there is a downturn and companies have to make interest payments. If you can't make it, you've got a problem.''"

The primary goal is to counter the critics who object to the company's tobacco operations, which under the names Philip Morris U.S.A. and Philip Morris International produce best-selling cigarette brands like Benson & Hedges, Chesterfield, L & M, Marlboro, Parliament and Virginia Slims. **********But don't look for paeans to puffing or entreaties to ''Come to where the flavor is'' in the television commercials, posters and Web pages that make up the campaign, which has a budget estimated at $100 million. Indeed, smoking is not mentioned except in discussing efforts to limit cigarette sales to minors and statements on the company's Web site at www.philipmorris.com that smoking ''causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema'' and other conditions. **********Rather, the campaign is focused on the charitable, philanthropic and social activism of Philip Morris divisions, particularly those like Kraft Foods and Miller Brewing that sell nontobacco products. The topics range from feeding the hungry and fighting domestic violence to helping victims of natural disasters and volunteer teaching. Many actors in the TV spots, all which include the words ''Based on a true story'' on screen, appear to be playing blue-collar or lower-income Americans, who make up a high percentage of smokers. **********''What the advertising tries to do is talk about the fact we are more than a tobacco company and what we do to give back to our communities,'' said Steven C. Parrish, senior vice president for corporate affairs at Philip Morris in New York. He is overseeing the campaign, which carries the theme ''Working to make a difference. The people of Philip Morris''; the ads are being created by Leo Burnett in Chicago, part of the Leo Group. **********''The issues involving our tobacco business are creating a negative image of the company,'' Mr. Parrish said. ''When people get a factual exposure to what the company is, what the company does, their perceptions begin to change.'' **********The campaign is emblematic of a change of heart -- if not lungs -- among tobacco companies as they end years of silence or defensive attacks in response to castigation from opponents of smoking. **********''We were saying 'No comment' in effect,'' Mr. Parrish said, ''and 'No comment' turned out to be a powerful comment in the minds of a lot of people, letting us be defined by what others were saying.'' **********The new tack plays to the public with low-key assertions of corporate beneficence and largess, presenting emotional rather than rational pitches infused with warmth, bonhomie and even occasional humor. **********In addition to the television, poster and Internet elements of the Philip Morris campaign, the image-enhancement bids include appeals from the Lorillard unit of the Loews Corporation, some carrying the theme ''New rules, new commitment''; a new magazine named CML The Camel Quarterly, custom-published for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company unit of the RJR Holdings Corporation by Wink Media, part of the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., and a fanciful telephone recording featuring a deliberately perfervid announcer who declares: ''We, the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, are in love with you. We're a giant corporation and you make us feel like a little kitten.'' Brown & Williamson is owned by British American Tobacco P.L.C. **********''We believe now more than ever that the more we openly and honestly discuss our company and what we're doing, people will have a better understanding of the facts and make up their own minds,'' Mr. Parrish said. **********''We know people will be skeptical, questioning our motives,'' he added, ''but we wanted to be as upfront and straightforward as we could.'' **********Needless to say, Mr. Parrish was accurate in predicting the skepticism the campaign would generate. **********''It doesn't fool anybody,'' said Martyn Straw, president at the Interbrand Corporation in New York, a corporate and brand identity consulting company. **********''The public could say, 'If you really want to help people, the best thing you can do is stop selling cigarettes.' '' **********Also, ''there's a difference between doing something and telling people you're doing something,'' Mr. Straw said. He offered a potentially more effective strategy: ''Undertake the activities quietly and then do public relations at the local level, letting the media pick up the story themselves.'' Interbrand is owned by the Omnicom Group. **********Philip Morris is ''working really, really hard to buy respectability,'' said Bill Novelli, president at the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, an advocacy organization. **********''That's important for employee morale,'' he added, particularly ''among the Kraft and Miller Brewing people.'' **********''It will be interesting to see if the company can climb up from the pariah status it now has,'' Mr. Novelli said. ''I don't think this will do it.'' **********John Garrison, chief executive at the American Lung Association in New York, offered another reason for the ads, which he dismissed as ''a smoke screen to fool the American people into thinking Philip Morris is a good corporate citizen.'' **********''They're trying desperately to improve their image in this country because of future litigation facing them,'' Mr. Garrison said. ''They're thinking about future juries.'' **********The advertising critic Bob Garfield, who writes for the trade publication Advertising Age, delivered a trenchant attack on the campaign last month. He summarized the gist of the ads this way: '' 'Never mind that we've killed more people than Hitler. Don't forget all the good works we've done with our fine Miller Lite and Kraft Velveeta cheese-like product.' '' **********Philip Morris executives are sensitive to perceptions that the campaign is minimizing or playing down the company's tobacco operations. **********''We don't want anyone to feel we are walking away from or hiding from our tobacco business,'' Mr. Parrish said. ''We're prohibited from advertising any tobacco brands, but youth smoking is something we wanted to talk about.'' **********One commercial in the campaign is centered on a program, encouraging retailers to demand identification from cigarette buyers. **********That initiative is separate from another campaign, also with a budget of $100 million, aimed at dissuading children from smoking. Those ads are by Young & Rubicam Advertising in New York."

Now Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, will give its competitor Federated, whose chains include Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Burdine's, a little cut of every on-line purchase by customers for the next three years. One can almost hear James M. Zimmerman, Federated's chief executive, singing, ''How sweet it is.'' **********The Wal-Mart deal adds to the impression that when it comes to the Web, Federated is ahead of the game. Federated's stock has risen 29 percent since the Fingerhut purchase was disclosed in February, though it initially declined on fears that Federated might be overpaying. **********Dan Eagan, a managing director at Blackrock Funds, one of Federated's largest shareholders, said: ''Mature retailers need to show they have a strategy in this area. Federated has shown they are thinking outside the box and ahead of the competition on this one.'' **********Providing services to burgeoning E-commerce ventures promises to be big business in the near future, which is why Fingerhut's positioning as a provider of back-end support is particularly enticing to investors. In theory, the companies best poised to make money on the Web are those  supplying services everyone needs -- like package delivery -- not those selling directly with exorbitant marketing costs and no profits in sight. **********But while Fingerhut's various Internet ventures clearly are on a growth trajectory, it will be a while before they can contribute substantially to Federated's bottom line. Currently, Fingerhut's Business Services, the division that handles such outsourcing, is projecting $40 million in revenue for this calendar year. Even if it ultimately grows to the ambitious $1 billion target of its executives, that is still a fraction of Federated's $17 billion in revenues **********A Federated spokeswoman, Carol Sanger, said the company does not expect that Fingerhut will represent more than 15 percent of revenue for the foreseeable future. **********Skeptics say the aura of the Internet is clouding investors' thinking. ''The numbers at Fingerhut aren't big enough to move the needle,'' said Brian James, senior retail analyst at Loomis Sayles, who says the stock's growth has largely been because of the better-than-predicted sales at Federated's stores. Still, there is a growing perception that Federated has done something right, he said. ''It's funny, now that sales in the core business have turned around and made them look smarter, people are giving more credibility to their Internet strategy,'' Mr. James said. **********It is true that the Fingerhut ventures that are creating the most excitement have little to do with Federated brands. First and foremost, there is Fingerhut Business Services, the division that Wal-Mart hired to handle back-office functions like warehousing, customer service and distribution for emerging electronic retailers. Only a year old, the division has 22 clients with name brands like Wet Seal, Levi's and Intuit. **********Fingerhut has three highly automated warehouses, each with 1.2 million square feet. Roughly half that space is excess, or available to the highest bidder. Fingerhut also has 50 years of experience in direct-to-consumer retailing and one of the largest, most detailed customer data bases in the business. **********John Buck, president of the business services subsidiary, predicts his little division will grow to ''$100 million by 2000, and easily be a billion-dollar business 5 or 10 years down the road.'' **********The second part of Fingerhut's Internet plan involves buying pieces of a wide range of E-commerce models. Since last year, Fingerhut has bought stakes in six young Internet companies. The unifying thread is that they all offer services that Fingerhut believes are a match for its extensive consumer base. PC Flowers and Gifts is a good example.  Hooking the little site into the cataloguer's data base has substantially increased its sales. Andy Johnson, president of Fingerhut's E-commerce division, said that 20 to 25 percent of the gift site's customers use the Fingerhut credit card. **********Two of these half-dozen sites have already registered to go public (PCFlowers and Gifts and FreeShop.com, a site for consumer service and product promotions) and could generate cash for Federated if they find a receptive stock market. In addition, Mr. Johnson estimates that all of Fingerhut's sites, which includes the six investments as well as the Federated offshoots and Fingerhut's own Web offering, will generate some $100 million in revenue this year and are poised for growth. **********But all of Fingerhut's enthusiasm for building Internet-related business is a bit of the tail wagging the dog. The real question is how is Fingerhut doing when it comes to expanding its core businesses on line? The two main issues are reaching more people who want Federated's brands and bringing its own big audience of catalogue shoppers to the Web. Company executives are vague on both topics. **********Fingerhut's customers are generally described as people of moderate income, which is the very group that is not now on the Internet. Mr. Johnson says that 62 percent of Fingerhut's customers have access to the Web, but he declines to answer how many have actually shopped on line. ''We are not worried about today's penetration. This is the future and all of our customers will be there,'' he said. **********As for helping Bloomingdale's and Macy's dominate upscale department store shopping on the Web the way they do in real life, Fingerhut is still exploring the possibilities. It holds twice-weekly phone summits with all its Web companies to discuss ''best practices,'' but beyond that outsiders are being left to guess at the synergies. Lucky for Fingerhut, Internet valuations are not about numbers, but about buzz."

He retired from his episcopal duties in 1983. **********General Pinochet overthrew Chile's elected President, Salvador Allende, a Socialist, in a coup in 1973 and held power as the country's President and dictator until 1990, after he lost a plebiscite. He was succeeded as President by Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democrat. **********Under Cardinal Silva Henriquez, the Chilean church made demands during the Pinochet years for the return of democracy. When the Cardinal preached about the sacredness of human rights, worshipers frequently cried out: ''Raul! Our friend, the people are with you!'' **********Despite death threats and other would-be intimidations, the Cardinal also helped gather documentation about human rights abuses, including torture, during the Pinochet era. And he sponsored efforts to help people who had lost their jobs because of political persecution to get new ones. He also sponsored legal assistance for political prisoners. **********When an organization that the Cardinal had set up to alleviate the sufferings of victims of repression was broken up by the Pinochet Government, he founded a successor group that managed to carry out similar activities. **********At a dinner in his home in 1985, he looked back on his attempts from 1973 to 1983 to deter the Pinochet Government from its use of terror. **********A guest at the dinner, the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a professor of law at Georgetown University and a former United States Congressman, wrote later that that the Cardinal had ''concluded by saying that the Government's oppression of the church is as bad as persecution of the church in the Roman Empire in the early centuries of Christianity.'' **********''Chile is harassing the church because, almost alone among social institutions, it represents the tortured, the exiled, the unemployed and the poor,'' Father Drinan wrote. **********The Cardinal also played an important role in forestalling a war in 1978 between Chile and its neighbor, Argentina. He is credited with persuading both Governments to consent to mediation of a border dispute by Pope John Paul II. **********Cardinal Silva Henriquez was born in Talca in central Chile, received a law degree from Catholic University in Santiago and was ordained a priest in 1938. From 1939 to 1959 he held a succession of educational posts, and from 1951 to 1959 he concurrently headed a charitable organization."

''I love what she represents: sexy finance.'' **********That's the way he sells young people on investing. For him, it's hard-core. It's sexy. And it's entertaining, or should be. That is precisely why he once booked an exotic dancer on his radio show: sort of Howard Stern meets Louis Rukeyser. **********''We had a stripper on with a mutual fund manager to talk about her needs,'' he said over lunch the other day. ''He put her into a short-term bond fund.'' **********Outrageous? Sure. But just a few short years after he began broadcasting a financial program called ''Capitalist Pig'' on Northwestern University's radio station, Mr. Hoenig has burst onto the scene as a journalist, financial commentator and author of ''Greed Is Good,'' an investment guide for people under 35, to be published later this month by Harper Business. **********He was named one of the top 30 financial journalists under 30 by TJFR, a newsletter for public relations professionals. He made the cover of Institutional Investor. (''It's Personal Finance, Dude!'' blared the headline.) He is also a regular contributor to P.O.V. magazine and is a financial commentator on ''Market Place,'' the public radio program. **********It was bound to happen. Wall Street is hot. Financial programs are multiplying like rabbits and even Grandma is pointing and clicking on E*Trade. So why not the rise of a young man with slick hair and raging blue eyes who finds a way to worship Michael R. Milken and Hugh Hefner in the same breath as Malcolm X? **********''This is not a hard sell,'' Mr. Hoenig says of his Capitalist Pig media operation, which now consists of a monthly newsletter, Capitalist Pig Report; T-shirts; a Web site; syndicated columns; television and radio programming, and even his mom's pig-shaped cookies. ''Somehow, the 'Antiques Road Show' on PBS sounds like a lot harder sell than this.'' **********Mr. Hoenig, who flops around in unlaced Doc Martens and a tie studded with pigs, doesn't find anything unusual about the way his often racy conversations veer from rising interest rates to the movie ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off.'' **********He says he simply wants to soak up all the good things in life as soon as possible -- an urge he ascribes in part to the deaths of his father and his older brother when he was still in his teens. **********He grew up in Glencoe, Ill., a Chicago suburb, in the 1980's, when greed was in style, he said. When he was 9, his father gave him two shares of Boeing stock, and he promptly fell in love with investing. He borrowed his mantra, ''Greed is good,'' from Gordon Gekko, the ruthless financier played by Michael Douglas in the film ''Wall Street.'' **********About the same time he got a public affairs radio program at Northwestern, he took a job clerking at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Before long, his interests converged and he turned his radio program into Capitalist Pig. **********Investment advice, often emphasized with profanities, was delivered against a backbeat of music from bands like Guns 'n' Roses. A highlight of each program was his naming the ''finance babe of the week'' and running an advice segment  called ''Ask the Pig.'' **********As for financial wisdom, this self-taught Wunderkind of Wall Street (''I just started on the Barnes & Noble bookshelf and read everything from Benjamin Graham to Marty Zweig'') has a very common-sense approach to investing. He preaches diversification, the benefits of compound interest and the debilitating effects of credit card debt. And while he doesn't have a track record as a stock picker, he simply advises  young people to educate themselves about the market and start investing. **********Making $5.50 an hour just doesn't kick it. ''That's good money, if you're 15, Amish or inhabiting a corrugated cardboard box,'' he says in his new book. And for him: ''The notion of being able to make money without actually doing much of anything jazzed me to no end.'' **********The popularity of the campus radio program led to appearances on CNN and MTV. He has also helped write a college textbook, ''Personal Finance'' (Irwin/McGraw Hill, 1999). **********He dropped out of Northwestern in 1998 (he says mother wants him to think of it as a leave of absence) to focus on trading his own money in the futures pits of the Chicago Board of Trade and to begin branding himself and his company under the Capitalist Pig logo, which features a cigar-puffing pig. He even hired the same agent who represents Phil Jackson, the former coach of the Chicago Bulls. **********''We speak the language of brands,'' Mr. Hoenig said of his target audience, 18-  to 35-year-olds. ''Since Day 1, we've been affixing logos and marketing slogans. What I want to do is start a life-style brand and tie it to something that is central to all of our lives: money.'' **********Mr. Hoenig -- a tireless self-promoter whose press kit arrives as a stuffed suitcase -- is trying to create a brand that delivers financial advice  with wacky wit and an unapologetic philosophy that money is everything. **********He boasts of having a unique voice. And, well, how often does Mr. Rukeyser mock day traders by coining a phrase like, ''Just buy after Regis and sell after Rosie''? **********Talking about stocks, after all, is just like talking about sports, he says. ''Instead of talking about E.R.A.'s, you're talking about P/E ratios.'' **********He counts James J. Cramer of Thestreet.com and Alan Abelson of Barron's among his heroes. In his office, just above his desk, is a large photocopied portrait of Lou Dobbs, the CNN financial news anchor. Is he another hero? **********''No,'' Mr. Hoenig said, flashing a sly grin, ''We just used that as a dartboard at my book party.''"

She said the only survivors of the attack were in her automobile, a small Russian-made Niva hatchback. **********Asked whether the troops knew that the convoy was civilian, she replied: ''They did see. They checked the cars and saw there were dead people lying all around.'' **********Russian soldiers took her and six other survivors to hospitals in nearby Ingushetia, she said. Radio Liberty said the wounded were the only refugees permitted to cross into Ingushetia that day. **********A doctor at one Ingush hospital that received some of the wounded said in an interview on Friday that one woman had been shot in the head and was in a coma, but that two other refugees were only slightly wounded. **********While allowing that their troops have staged air and ground assaults on roads leading out of Grozny in recent days, Russian military officials have steadfastly denied that any civilians were injured in a long string of attacks on Friday. **********The Interfax news service quoted the officials as saying that 30 vehicles were destroyed Friday on roads leading out of Grozny, but that all the cars contained rebels, not civilians. The military believes rebels are using the roads to ferry supplies and reinforcements into Grozny to prepare for a defense of the city. **********Russian officials said Friday that they had opened a safe passage out of Grozny for the thousands of civilians. But it was unclear how many were taking advantage of the route, if indeed it even existed; both sides have consistently exaggerated their achievements and minimized their setbacks and misdeeds. **********Today the Russian military withdrew an earlier claim that its troops had captured another strategic town, Argun, near Grozny, but their victory seemed only a matter of time. According to reports, 500 militants in the village were surrounded by as many as 20,000 Russian troops. **********The Russian advance has become more difficult in recent days as ground troops have taken a more active role, but it is clear that the rebels, who all but ruled the province since the last war three years ago, are on the defensive. A pro-rebel Internet site, www.kavkaz.org, stated that the guerrillas had lost 28 men in Argun and a second town, Alkhan-Yurt, and that they had been forced to retreat south. **********Reports on Friday indicated that continuous bombing had left in flames and ruins what little remains of Grozny. Today Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov announced that he had invited the chairman of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, Knut Vollebaek, to visit the region on Dec. 14 and 15."

Pervez Musharraf was running behind schedule again today,  with top posts still to fill, hundreds of the corrupt yet to arrest, back taxes to collect and policies to reconsider. His post-coup government is only five weeks old. **********These days, he splits his time between the capital, Islamabad, and nearby Rawalpindi, home of the army headquarters. Since he ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Oct. 12, General Musharraf has had both the military and the government to run, though the government is now the the work he considers the more important. **********''The nation is the bigger task that has been given to me by destiny,'' he said in an interview, sitting ramrod straight in his unwrinkled khaki uniform. **********His style is becoming familiar. His manner is forceful, his voice calm, his grin triumphant. He admires candor, especially in himself. **********''I am a realist,'' he said several times. ''I am not a diplomat.'' **********When General Musharraf speaks, the words seem to flow directly from the heart, though the logic of what he says often veers into some odd twists and turns. **********Most assuredly, he said, Mr. Sharif, who has been detained and kept away from his family and lawyers since the coup, will be given ''an absolutely fair and transparent trial.'' **********The new governing structure is ''entirely civilian,'' he said, the general said, except that the military will monitor everything to correct  problems that it sees. **********''Nobody monitors the military,'' the general said, somewhat perplexed by a follow-up question. ''The military has its own monitoring system.'' **********These are strange days in this nation of 150 million people divided among those who have lost most of their faith in government and those who have lost it all. **********Democracy has enjoyed only a sporadic life here, and it has almost always been a disappointment. The last four elected governments -- two under Mr. Sharif and two under Benazir Bhutto -- have failed to complete their terms as allegations of gross corruption erupted. **********The military, which has ruled for more than half the nation's 52-year history, has been a less unstable, if not always a less uninspiring, institution. **********Nevertheless, the general's takeover has been welcomed with enthusiasm by most Pakistanis, even those who champion democracy. Many leading civilians have joined the government, agreeing that corruption and cronyism have to be weeded out of by a stern military hand before the political landscape is again ready for elections. **********General Musharraf, 56, frequently uses the language of a populist. He has declared war on fat cats who have willfully defaulted on bank loans, and indeed the arrests of some of the debt-laden elite began today. He seeks a ''devolution of power'' to the grass-roots, and he said he wanted to make war on poverty and ignorance. **********At the same time, the general said, he has no idea when the nation will again be ready for democracy. His tenure as army chief is scheduled to end in October 2001. But he said he had given no thought to whether that date should be honored. **********''I will fulfill this task to the best of my ability,'' General Musharraf said. ''And in fulfilling this task, I will look into this aspect of whether I should retire in the year 2001.'' **********Pakistan is the newest nuclear power. It also has $32 billion in foreign debt and is nearly bankrupt. International lenders have frequently suggested reducing military spending, an idea that General Musharraf is quick to dismiss. On the other hand, he said, he has no intention of competing with India, the archrival, in a nuclear arms race. **********''We are working on a strategy of minimum deterrence,'' he said, adding that Pakistani intelligence agencies were well versed in India's more ambitious plans for a nuclear arsenal. ''We are not concerned with a mathematical ratio and proportion. We understand and we have quantified our own minimum deterrence.'' **********He was sitting in the conference room of the Army Secretariat. On one wall was an enormous painting of the Battle of Chawinda, with valiant Pakistani soldiers firing on Indian tanks in 1965. On another wall was a set of photographs of artillery placements in the Siachen Glacier area, where the Pakistanis have been fighting the Indians for 15 years. **********General Musharraf said he wanted peace with India, but he had no kind words for that nation's leaders. He said they refused to negotiate in good faith when it came to Kashmir. ''They want to sidetrack it, sideline it,'' he said. ''That is their strategy. Let me very clearly say that I am not playing that game.'' **********In New Delhi, General Musharraf is widely viewed as the architect of ''the Kargil operation,'' a military foray this year into the stark mountains on the Indian side of Kashmir. Heavy combat almost led to a fourth all-out war between Pakistan and India. **********The general does not disavow his role, but he said the government and military were in agreement on Kargil. Two briefings were given to Prime Minister Sharif in November or December last year, he said, and there was another meeting in February. **********''He was a much more aggressive man than I was,'' said General Musharraf, adding that the prime minister would sometimes jest about making a formidable attack on Srinigar, the summer capital of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir. **********The two men more or less got along back then. He was troubled by Mr. Sharif's ineffective governance, the general said. But rather than consider a coup, the general tried to think of ways that the military could help. **********A breach began to open when the prime minister started a ''whispering campaign'' among the top army leaders, trying to divide the officer corps, General Musharraf said. **********On Oct. 12, while the general was returning from Sri Lanka, the prime minister dismissed him. General Musharraf said he had no inkling of being shoved aside until his flight back from Sri Lanka, on a commercial jet with 198 passengers aboard, was denied permission to land in Karachi. The crew alerted him to the problem. Air-traffic control had directed the pilot to leave Pakistan. The plane had only enough fuel to make it to India. **********''I told them we'd do that only over my dead body,'' General Musharraf said. **********By the general's reckoning, the prime minister was plotting treason, kidnapping and murder, commanding the control tower in such a way that the plane and all its passengers would die. Vehicles blocked the landing strips in Karachi. Runway lights had been switched off. **********Fortunately, as the general recounted, his officers realized what was happening and took over the tower, letting the plane land safely, with seven minutes of fuel remaining.

New York Life had advocated the hybrid, which would have allowed the sale of stock while the company remained under the technical control of policyholders. **********The other leading advocate of the hybrid structure, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, announced in November that it was converting to public ownership, so Bill Werfelman, a New York Life spokesman, said the company ''felt it was important to let people know what we were going to do.'' **********Several analysts said they believed one reason for the decision not to go public was that New York Life -- which, by some calculations, has been reporting below industry returns on capital -- was concerned it might be taken over or be forced by investors to reorganize. Under the hybrid structure, a takeover would have been impossible. **********''There's no question that a powerful, strong company like New York Life with the cash flow it has, its market position and distribution system would be a very interesting candidate for a company that might want to have a strong position in the life industry,'' said Sy Sternberg, New York Life's chief executive, in an interview yesterday from San Francisco where his board was meeting. **********But he said the main reasons he recommended to the board that the company's structure remain unchanged, and won its unanimous endorsement in a vote Monday morning, was that he believes in the mutual concept. That allows policyholders to receive dividends that reduce the cost of their coverage and have a stake in the company. He also believes that New York Life has enough cash -- at least $3 billion -- to carry out its acquisition plans. **********Other big mutual insurers that are shifting to public ownership besides Metropolitan -- the Prudential Insurance Company of America and the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, for example -- have said they are doing so to have shares that they can use to buy other companies, thus gaining market share and economies of scale. **********Though Mr. Sternberg spoke of ''an intangible value'' in mutual ownership, many in the insurance business say there seems to be little practical distinction these days for policyholders between mutual and shareholder companies. Because of competitive pressures, they say, prices for coverage are very similar. **********Many in the industry consider it inevitable that mutual companies shift to public ownership. And some analysts said they believed Mr. Sternberg might simply be postponing such a change to give himself breathing room to increase New York Life's returns, which would lead to a higher stock price should it go public, and provide protection against unwanted changes. **********Mr. Sternberg said the company would periodically reconsider going public, but said he had ''not concluded that eventually'' it must do so. **********Duff & Phelps in Chicago said that New York Life had been reporting returns below the 5.9 percent average of all mutual life insurers. Mr. Sternberg said his company's returns had been slightly above average. But they were still well below Duff & Phelps's calculated average return of 12.5 percent for publicly held life insurance companies. **********''If your return on capital is mediocre, it makes no sense to convert to a shareholder-based ownership because it opens you up to the possibility that someone will come in and buy up your stock at a depressed price and force management changes,'' said Cathy Seifert, an analyst for the equity research group at Standard & Poor's. **********Another prospect, she said, is that an efficient competitor would buy the company outright, sensing a bargain in the low stock price and expecting to transfer the efficiency of his company to the one being acquired. **********None of the recently converted mutual companies have been taken over. But the field of potential buyers may increase sharply. Mr. Sternberg noted that Congress was once again considering the elimination of Depression-era restrictions that would permit ''a bank, a securities firm or one of the larger global companies'' to buy an insurance company."

SHAIKEN; Paradoxes Of G.M.'s Promise,FIVE QUESTIONS for HARLEY S. SHAIKEN; Paradoxes Of G.M.'s Promise," **********A FEW short years ago, many working Americans worried about the seemingly constant downsizings by major corporations, and there was much hand-wringing about whether anyone could expect to join a company fresh from school and work there long enough to retire with a gold watch. In board rooms, the worry was the opposite: that decades of steady gains by unions on job security and work-rule issues in the prosperous 1950's and 60's had made the labor force in many American factories too expensive and inflexible to compete in the global economy, especially during recessions. **********The long economic expansion of the 1990's has created so many new jobs that downsizing has lost its capacity to terrify most workers, and young people joining the work force often tell survey takers that they don't expect to stay at one company for a decade, never mind a career. **********Against this backdrop, the General Motors Corporation, one of those perhaps most buffeted by the global economic forces said to drive all the downsizing, dropped an anachronistic bombshell last week: an offer of lifetime employment to unionized workers with at least 10 years' seniority, as part of the company's efforts to reach a new labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union. The offer comes as a wave of G.M. workers hired in the 1960's and 70's nears retirement. **********What could G.M. have in mind with an offer that seems to fly in the face of sweeping, decades-long trends? Harley S. Shaiken, a professor specializing in labor and global economic issues at the University of California at Berkeley, delved into the issues it raises.   ROBYN MEREDITH **********Q. With companies in the auto industry and elsewhere pushing steadily toward outsourcing and seeking greater flexibility to compete globally, and even the Japanese beginning to abandon lifetime job tenure, how is G.M.'s offer of lifetime employment guarantees possible? **********A. In a way, this is lifetime job security that probably envisions downsizing -- that's the paradox. The paradox is they're willing to guarantee increased job security but they're asking for increased flexibility, which may result in outsourcing. In the context of the G.M. offer, the devil really is in the details. **********Q. What does a promise of lifetime employment really mean when auto industry labor contracts typically last only three years? **********A. Usually when a company says ''lifetime job security,'' they mean two things. First, they are willing to put aside a pool of money to guarantee jobs. Second, they are often asking for a considerable amount in return. **********Whatever is negotiated now can be renegotiated in three years. The guarantee is only as good as the goodwill involved. Previous attempts at lifetime job security in this and other industries have generally fallen short of people's life spans. **********Q. Can G.M. afford to make this offer precisely because so many of its workers are eligible to retire within a few years? **********A. The cost is high up front, but it could be one of the better investments that G.M. makes. The job security provisions really are a down payment on a more motivated work force, a better relationship with the U.A.W. -- and ultimately a more competitive G.M. **********Q. Will Ford and DaimlerChrysler be forced to follow G.M.'s lead? **********A. There's nothing in what we've seen so far in the job security provisions that is going to cause a major roadblock, certainly at DaimlerChrysler, and likely not at Ford either. In fact, a settlement could come first at DaimlerChrysler, and then Ford will have a pretty powerful precedent to follow. **********There is little question now in the entire post-World War II era that the auto union has led the way in a lot of innovations in labor. What happens here will be closely watched in virtually every other manufacturing industry. As workers retire, you could have lifetime job security and a smaller work force. **********Q. Does this kind of offer appeal more to rank-and-file auto workers than it does to their union? **********A. I don't think so, and that goes to an unusual quality of the U.A.W. and this industry. A U.A.W. worker in Flint says, ''Is my niece going to be able to get a job in this plant? Is my son-in-law?'' The concern for creating new jobs isn't just felt at the leadership level."

But Jakarta, so often and so recently roiled by violent unrest, was otherwise peaceful. **********As Indonesia enters the final stage of a political transformation that began 16 months ago with the fall of President Suharto, there is guarded optimism here that the assembly will be able to elect a new president and set the stage for democracy without further bloodshed. **********''The mood of the country is that we want a legitimate government as quickly as possible,'' said Umar Juoro, an adviser to President B. J. Habibie, who succeeded Mr. Suharto. ''The students respect their representatives in the Parliament as legitimate. That's why you don't see significant protests.'' **********In a reminder that this remains a volatile country, fighting broke out again today between Muslims and Christians in Ambon, an island 1,440 miles east of Jakarta. The rival groups burned houses and a mosque. Fifteen people, including a soldier, were killed in the clashes, witnesses told The Associated Press. **********But in Jakarta, people focused on the televised assembly proceedings. This is the first legislature elected in a multiparty ballot in four decades. Under Mr. Suharto, the legislature had been dominated by the governing Golkar Party, serving mainly as a rubber stamp. **********On Sunday, however, the assembly elected a leading reform politician, Amien Rais, as Speaker. Mr. Rais, a Muslim intellectual, has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Suharto and Mr. Habibie. Political analysts said his rise could give fresh momentum to political change. **********In remarks after he was sworn in, Mr. Rais said that he would review a decree by the previous assembly  that authorized an investigation of Mr. Suharto and his family. Despite public outrage at the family's accumulation of vast wealth, the inquiry has proceeded at a glacial pace. **********The election of a Speaker precedes the assembly's vote for President, which has been moved forward, to Oct. 20 from Nov. 10, because of fears that Indonesia could fall into a dangerous leadership vacuum. **********Mr. Habibie, a protege of Mr. Suharto, has waged a mostly futile battle to establish legitimacy since being thrust into office. With his Government swamped by scandal and a disastrous departure from East Timor, Mr. Habibie has become deeply unpopular -- even in his party. **********Despite Mr. Habibie's weaknesses, analysts said, it is premature to write him off. The President is chosen by the assembly rather than being directly elected. Although voters elected 462 of its 700 members in June, the assembly also has 38 representatives from the military and 200 representatives of regional and special-interest groups. **********No single party won a majority of the seats, guaranteeing that the presidential election will be a byzantine exercise in deal making and coalition building. The choice of Speakers for the assembly and the lower house is important, because they are likely to be power brokers. **********Mr. Rais's election surprised political analysts because he defeated a candidate supported by the chief opposition figure, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Ms. Megawati, whose Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle won the most seats in the parliamentary election, has been widely regarded as the likely next President. **********But analysts said Ms. Megawati's failure to gain her candidate's victory revealed her party's weakness in forging coalitions. Mr. Rais was supported by an amalgam of parties, including his own reformist National Mandate Party and Golkar, the party of Mr. Suharto and Mr. Habibie. **********''Megawati has done herself no good in this process,'' said James W. Castle, a consultant at the Castle Group here. ''Her lack of skills are damaging in a country that depends so much on coalition building.'' **********If Ms. Megawati has stumbled, her main foe hardly seems stronger. Mr. Habibie is to deliver an ''accountability'' speech to the assembly next week. Political analysts said the speech would be his last chance to explain why he should not be tossed on the political scrap heap. **********Mr. Juoro, who is helping draft the speech, said Mr. Habibie would defend his policy in East Timor, arguing that stability had returned in the territory, where residents voted for independence on Aug. 30, after the arrival of an international military force. On the subject of a festering bank scandal known as Baligate, Mr. Juoro said the President would note that he had turned over the case to the police and prosecutors. **********''That may not satisfy a lot of people,'' Mr. Juoro acknowledged. **********Mr. Juoro said Mr. Habibie's advisers were urging him to strike a conciliatory tone. ''We want him to be direct and honest about what he has achieved,'' Mr. Juoro said, ''and what he was unable to solve.''"

You've noticed that Americans are getting fatter, and that the government blames obesity and inactivity for more than 300,000 premature deaths every year.  You've also noticed that scientists believe fatty foods kill people, and that fast-food outlets are selling cheeseburgers with both hands. **********You pilot your late-model Mercedes into the drive-through lane, risking grease stains on the leather upholstery. You make a purchase and discover that fast-food packaging is mute as to a more important risk. Nowhere does it say that eating a bucket of hot wings could result in serious injury or death. **********So you sue, hoping to win millions on behalf of heart patients -- as well as potential heart patients, who claim compensation for the worry that all those cheeseburgers may someday give them heart disease. Better yet, perhaps the states, unwilling to regulate cheeseburgers, will retain you to sue on behalf of the taxpayers, who have had to foot the public health bill for all the cheeseburgers they can't stop eating. **********Far-fetched? Why? The same line of reasoning underlies the litigation that has succeeded so spectacularly against the tobacco companies; similar suits are pending against manufacturers of guns. **********''The connection between cigarettes and guns,'' says Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University who founded the Tobacco Products Liability Project to spur lawsuits against the industry, ''is that both used political influence to escape safety regulation, and eventually people got tired of that and turned to the courts.'' **********He is right, and at first it is easy to applaud the plaintiffs' lawyers who brought the suits. But are guns and cigarettes really the same? For better or worse, Americans have the right to bear arms, the government already regulates guns, and it's at least debatable whether guns, unlike cigarettes, really do more harm than good. Besides, our experiences with outright prohibition of dangerous products like alcohol and drugs have been terrible. **********The point is not the merits of gun control (which I advocate) or smoking (which I abhor). The point is, who decides? Despite the role of money in politics, government can regulate harmful products whenever there is the political will to do so. So it is puzzling to find governments as plaintiffs in product liability lawsuits. ''It's bizarre to go to court and ask for relief from the fact that you have the wrong laws,'' said Daniel Polsby, a law professor at George Mason University. **********Consider global warming. When coastal cities find themselves building dikes to keep the waves at bay, why not sue Exxon and General Motors over their role in changing the world's climate? And why wait until the waters start rising? The science on global warming is already substantial, but having good science on your side is no prerequisite for suing, as the makers of silicone breast implants (and their unfortunate shareholders) well know. **********By the lights of modern jurisprudence, it would make perfect sense for ''victims'' of fast food and climate change to sue, and the sooner the better: they might even succeed at deterring substantial harm. One claim against gun makers is that they failed to take the steps they should have to make sure that weapons aren't used improperly. But last year, 15,935 Americans died in alcohol-related car accidents, and the auto industry for years has known how to install devices that could make it more difficult for someone impaired by alcohol to start a car. Why isn't the plaintiff's bar assaulting Detroit on that point? **********Perhaps it is just that they haven't gotten to it yet. At the moment, another target is in their sights: H.M.O.'s. The lawyers see themselves as protectors of innocent patients against profit-hungry corporations bent on rationing care. If the lawyers succeed (their first case is against Aetna), H.M.O.'s may indeed change the way they do business. But premiums will inevitably rise, forcing more Americans to join the 44 million who already lack health insurance. **********THAT'S the trouble with letting lawyers and juries tackle social problems that elected officials can't seem to solve: when the buck is passed to the courts, the outcome may never suit anyone but the lawyers. Consider the Supreme Court's record. It upheld slavery until the Civil War made its decisions moot. It tried to paper over racial segregation with the ''separate but equal'' fiction, and when that failed, ordered public schools integrated, yet de facto school segregation persists. Roe v. Wade has hardly laid the abortion debate to rest. **********It's hard to believe that lawyers, judges and juries can do any better with guns or global warming (or gluttony). But if the political system remains paralyzed by money and cynicism, it shouldn't be surprising if the courts try."

For one thing, he said, Internet pharmacies have been unable to join many insurance networks that cover prescription medications. As a result, no on-line pharmacy can guarantee that all customers will have their prescriptions covered. **********Many insurers hire outside companies to handle mail-order subscription refills, which account for roughly 15 percent of the estimated $100 billion prescription market. Since on-line pharmacies basically perform the same type of service, some insurers have balked at the competition. Mr. Pigott said that some insurers ''have told us they have their own plans for going on line, and that has made things very difficult.'' **********Just as with traditional pharmacies, prescriptions are the linchpin of successful on-line drugstore, since they attract customers who then buy other items. Indeed, Soma and rivals like Drugstore.com and Planetrx have projected that a large chunk of total revenues will come from nonprescription items. **********With or without the insurers, on-line pharmacies face fierce competition in CVS, which says it has more than 55 million prescription customers and more than 9,000 insurance providers. That means nearly all insured customers who visit the Soma site will have their prescriptions covered. CVS's marketing and buying power will also insure that it can survive price competitions with Internet rivals."

The dollar, which has been sliding relentlessly against the Japanese yen all summer and hit a 43-month low yesterday, continues to fall. **********A lower dollar, by driving up the price of imports and threatening higher inflation, provokes the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to try to deflect the threat. That spooks foreign investors, prompting them to pull their money out of American investments, letting the air out of inflated stock prices on Wall Street. Consumers, worried about their portfolios, pull back on spending and the economy falls into recession. **********Sounds scary, right? But for all the popular fears raised by a falling currency, the direct threat to the United States economy is actually quite small. **********On the other hand, the threat to Japan from a stronger currency -- by making its exports more expensive even as its economy teeters on the edge of deflation while barely crawling out of recession -- is far more grave. It should be reassuring that Japan has all the financial resources and monetary tools it needs to keep its economy growing and spare everyone else pain. But its central bankers remain frighteningly passive and unwilling to use them. **********The yen began to soar early this summer after the recession-plagued Japanese economy suddenly showed signs of life. Sensing a turnaround in sunken stock and real estate prices, foreign investors bought yen, driving its value higher, so they could re-enter Japanese financial markets. **********Adding to the dollar's woes is the overhang of a huge trade deficit that has reached, according to data released this week, a rate of more than $300 billion a year. The excessive outflow of dollars accompanying the trade deficit could eventually force the dollar down. That prospect may already be persuading foreign investors to lighten up their holdings of American assets. The dollar fell from about 120 yen in early summer to around 104 yesterday. **********A drop in the dollar against the yen affects the pocketbooks of American consumers, who must hand over more dollars to buy Toyota minivans or Toshiba laptops. But the impact on the economy of the current slide against the yen is minimal because the dollar has not dropped against most other major currencies. Over the last several months, the dollar fell by an average of only about 2 percent against other currencies, according to Federal Reserve data. The impact is further diluted by the fact that imports account for less than 15 percent of national spending. **********It might also be argued that a lower dollar can even do some good. Surely exporters think so. But there will probably be little long-term benefit from  higher export sales. The Fed is currently on a campaign to slow the economy because it thinks spending is growing at an unsustainably high rate. If exports pick up, the Fed will no doubt clamp down a bit harder to offset any unwelcome stimulus. **********But if a sliding dollar is little direct threat to the United States, the same is not true of the risk a swelling yen poses for Japan. Despite having a Government that is running a huge fiscal deficit of nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product and has pumped nearly $200 billion into commercial banks to get them lending money again, the Japanese economy grew at a paltry 1 percent annual rate between April and June. **********''A further blow to export sales from a rising yen hardly helps,'' said Rudi Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********But the real problem is that Japan suffers from insufficient domestic spending, causing deflation. **********So what is to be done? The ultimate solution, many economists say, is to print money -- lots of money. The idea, says Professor Alan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University and an adviser to the Bank of Japan, is to print enough money to stop prices from falling any further. The extra yen will also dampen the rise in the yen. **********But having brought lending rates down to near zero, the Japanese say that they have already pushed monetary policy as far as it can go. Mr. Meltzer vehemently disagrees. **********''Even with interest rates near zero, monetary policy is not dead,'' he said. The Bank of Japan can, he explains, still use its infinite supply of yen to buy bonds, stocks and real estate. Buying dollars would push down the value of the yen, promoting exports. And buying assets would drive up the price of stocks and other forms of wealth, another good way to generate consumer spending. The upshot is that despite near-zero interest rates, Japan's monetary policy is still too tight. **********Yet the Bank of Japan dithers. Indeed, over the weekend, a prominent monetary official stated that the bank would not throw a lot more yen into the economy even as it intervened in the currency market, at its Government's instruction. **********The Bank of Japan is, in the parlance of economics, engaged in ''sterilized'' intervention. It is temporarily buying dollars and selling yen, hoping to stop the yen's rise. But at the same time, it is siphoning yen out of the domestic money market to keep the overall supply of yen pretty much unchanged. **********''We have continually sterilized intervention,'' Masaru Hayami, the the governor of the Bank of Japan, said this week, ''because we have provided ample funds to the market.'' **********Most economists argue that sterilized intervention, because it keeps the relative supplies of yen and dollars constant, cannot change the relative value of the currencies. **********Here's another reason to dismiss the importance of sterilized interventions. According to the most recent worldwide survey, taken in 1998, about $1.5 trillion of foreign currency trades took place every day, of which about $300 billion involve the yen. But the sterilized intervention by the Bank of Japan amounts to only a couple of billion dollars worth. **********If the Japanese will not aggressively address the soaring value of the yen, will the Clinton Administration? Probably not, and for good reason. **********The Federal Reserve has made clear that it would not alter its monetary policy solely to manage the value of foreign currencies. Few economists would disagree with that policy. But that leaves the Administration with only sterilized intervention itself, which will do no more good on this side of the Pacific Ocean than on Japan's side. Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury Secretary, constantly reminds investors, as did his predecessor, that the Clinton Administration favors a strong dollar. But he has limited tools to pursue that specific goal. **********There is, however, little cause for despair. Limited tools do not mean no tools. Indeed, in the worst case, where speculative frenzy begins to drive the dollar to worrisome levels, Mr. Summers' use of well-timed sterilized interventions could be decisive in altering the mood of market participants. **********Professor Alan S. Blinder of Princeton, and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, explains that the long-run value of the dollar versus the yen largely depends on economic fundamentals, like the relative growth rates, interest rates and prices in the two countries. For example, stronger growth in one country tends to attract capital from a country with weaker growth. And a rise in interest rates in the United States relative to rates in Japan would encourage investors to buy dollars to invest in United States financial markets, driving up the value of the dollar relative to the yen. **********But day-to-day exchange rates are driven by investor expectations and speculators. The day-to-day rates can, says Mr. Blinder, depart from long-run fundamentals by wide margins and for prolonged periods. **********There is, he says, Blinder's law of speculative markets. ''Markets normally move in the right direction,'' he said, ''but they exaggerate the magnitude by a factor of between 3 and 10.'' His point is that markets with speculators overreact and well-timed intervention by governments can move exchange rates closer to their proper levels, minimizing dislocation to exporters and importers. **********Mr. Dornbusch agrees. Nothing about economic fundamentals justified pushing the yen to 80 to the dollar in 1995, he says, and nothing would justify pushing it much below its current level. If the rate drops lower than 100, he says, timely intervention by Mr. Summers and his counterparts in Tokyo could scare investors from pursuing their extreme expectations. The purpose of intervention is to make speculators bear the risk of betting wrong. **********Chastened speculators might not be so quick to push the yen to 90 from 100 if they believe that the lower rate is not sustainable in the long run and that Tokyo and Washington are committed to keeping it from going that low in the short run. **********So while the major onus for straightening out the dollar-yen exchange rate lies in Tokyo, the Clinton Administration is not defenseless in the wake of Japanese monetary authorities who resist doing what should come easy and cheap: turning on their printing press."

Finding a way to apologize to China is turning out to be just about impossible. **********Ever since a B-2 bomber struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade a month and a day ago, the Administration has been talking about sending a mission to Beijing to explain, in person, how the use of an outdated map led to tragedy. Three Chinese were killed in the bombing, which the United States has insisted was an accident. There is urgency in the mission. Until the matter is cleared up, the Chinese have said, most interchanges with Washington are on hold, including talks over China's admission to the World Trade Organization. **********Senior Administration officials said today that the delegation would probably leave for Beijing this weekend. ''But that may be optimistic,'' one official said, since the intelligence agencies, the State Department and the National Security Council are ''are still debating exactly what to say.'' **********In fact, the Administration has tied itself in knots over who should deliver the mea culpa and exactly how detailed an accounting should be provided. And then there is the question of how to finesse Beijing's demand that those responsible be publicly identified and punished. **********That is a sensitive issue at the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, each of which has been blamed for some portion of the error. **********After considerable debate, the White House appears to have settled on a messenger: Thomas A. Pickering, the Under Secretary of State for political affairs and former Ambassador to India, Russia and the United Nations. **********At a high-level meeting of President Clinton's advisers last week, several officials questioned whether Mr. Pickering, though one of Washington's most experienced diplomats, was high-ranking enough to satisfy the status-conscious Chinese. **********Some officials wondered if it would be wiser to send a bigger name -- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, perhaps, or the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger. **********But Ms. Albright is busy with Kosovo and does not get along very well with the Chinese. The Chinese would prefer Mr. Berger, said another official familiar with the internal debate, but he is also busy with Kosovo and has been criticized for not warning President Clinton earlier about suspicions that China had stolen American nuclear secrets. **********Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said today that Mr. Berger would be formally invited to appear before the Intelligence Committee to answer three questions: ''What did he know, when did he know it and what did he tell the President about the espionage?'' **********The Administration official said, ''I'm not sure that a headline reading 'Berger Apologizes to Chinese' is exactly what the White House has in mind.'' **********Some have suggested sending the departing Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, who has particularly good relations with the Chinese -- even though he opposed closing a deal on trade organization membership in April during the visit of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. **********The biggest fear in the State Department is that the Chinese will find the whole explanation of the bombing less than convincing. **********''It's a story of incredible technical sophistication combined with incredible ineptitude,'' one official said."

In 1997, it changed its Constitution to permit extradition and the Justice Department is currently seeking to bring 10 Colombians to stand trial in the United States on drug charges. **********Among 31 people arrested in early morning raids in Colombia and Mexico today were Alejandro Bernal Madrigal, whom a Federal official described as the head of the biggest cocaine ring in Colombia, and Fabio Ochoa, a member of the Medellin cartel. **********The arrests come as Colombia is seeking $3.5 billion in international aid, mostly from the United States, to combat drug trafficking and leftist insurgents and to prop up its faltering economy. **********At a news conference here today, Luis Alberto Moreno, Colombia's Ambassador to the United States, said that the Colombian Government and its judicial system would review extradition requests for the suspects and fulfill those deemed legally warranted. **********''They will be certainly extradited to the United States,'' Mr. Moreno said. **********Both United States and Colombian officials said in interviews today that they believed the extradition of Colombians for trial in this country could have a significant impact on drug trafficking. Colombian courts have often handed out light sentences and drug lords have continued to operate from jails. **********But Michael Shifter, a senior fellow with the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy institute here, said he doubted such moves would have much impact. **********''It is a mistake to look at this as something that marks a major step in the drug war,'' said Mr. Shifter, who has studied drug issues. ''It is not going to make a difference in American cities that a few Colombians are going to be extradited to the U.S.'' **********Federal officials estimated that those arrested today were part of an operation that may have been responsible for shipping 20 to 30 tons of cocaine monthly from Colombia through Mexico to the United States and Europe. **********Federal officials said that the drug ring used four different routes to send cocaine to the United States,  including shipping the drug by shrimp boats and in deliveries of frozen fruit pulp produced by plants controlled by the drug gang. **********''In our estimation, this was the most significant cocaine trafficking operation in Colombia today,'' William Ledwith, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's office of international operations, said in an interview. **********The Colombia ring also worked  closely with drug traffickers in Mexico, including an operation once run by Amado Carillo Fuentes, who was at one time time that country's top drug smuggler. **********A senior official of the Drug Enforcement Administration said that the investigation was particularly significant because, although the inquiry was conducted by officials in Colombia, the United States and other countries, those charged with crimes had been indicted only in the United States. **********Previously, most Colombians facing drug charges, including the leaders of the Cali and Medellin cartels, were charged both in the United States and Colombia. That allowed them to be tried in Colombia and receive more lenient sentences than they were likely to have received in the United States. **********Those arrested today on drug trafficking and money laundering charges were indicted on Sept. 30 by a Federal jury in Miami. The charges were unsealed today. **********Mr. Ledwith of the Drug Enforcement Administration said that the drug trafficking headed by Mr. Bernal had emerged a few years ago to fill the void left by the deaths or arrests of the heads of the Medellin and Cali cartels. **********For much of the 1990's, the issue of extradition was a source of tension  between American and Colombian officials. American authorities argued that Colombia's refusal to extradite its citizens reflected its ambivalence toward the drug trade. But Colombians also had to confront a wave of terrorists acts by drug traffickers opposed to facing trial in the United States. **********Ambassador Moreno said in an interview that Colombians' attitudes  toward extradition began to shift about four years ago. **********''I think people came to recognize that extradition is a very useful tool in fighting the war on drugs,'' he said. **********The change in the country's law, in December 1997, applies only to those charged with crimes after that date. **********One Drug Enforcement Administration official said the agency was pleased with how Colombian officials were handling the pending requests, which he estimated could take anywhere from one to two years to resolve. **********Extradition requests for those arrested today will be made in coming weeks, the official said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/10/world/germans-approve-new-plan-to-pay-holocaust-victims.html,David Sanger,1999-02-10,,1005,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Germans Approve New Plan To Pay Holocaust Victims,Germans Approve New Plan To Pay Holocaust Victims," **********The German Government said today that it had agreed in principle to establish a  compensation fund, financed by the biggest names in German industry and banking, for victims of Nazi horrors. **********The proposal, announced here today by a top aide to Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, appears to be an effort to short-circuit a wave of lawsuits in American courts against German companies that made use of slave labor and forced labor during World War II, or profited from assets seized from Jews and other victims. **********German officials said the size of the fund is still to be determined. They have made it clear that they want to avoid the kind of international bruising that Switzerland suffered for nearly two years, as the Government fought off legal and diplomatic actions against Swiss banks. Ultimately the two largest banks in Switzerland reached a $1.25 billion settlement, which was formally signed last month. **********At a news conference here Mr. Schroder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, said it would take some time before the German Government, its major corporations, Jewish groups and lawyers for Holocaust victims reached an agreement, including the sticky problem of settling on an amount, to resolve claims against German companies. **********Nonetheless, participants in the talks said they thought that the amount paid by the Swiss banks would be a starting point, and that the German settlement -- likely to include Deutsche Bank, Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen , Siemens and others -- could easily reach the billions. **********What the German companies want in return is exactly what the Swiss got: a ''global'' agreement that ends virtually all suits. Mr. Hombach also suggested that Germany had concluded, after watching the Swiss experience, that a prolonged fight was not in the interest of the country or its companies. **********''You could legally win and lose your reputation,'' he said. The idea of a voluntary settlement ''is not something that the head of the legal departments of German companies might subscribe to, but the C.E.O.'s understand the political importance.'' **********In many ways the Swiss and German cases are not comparable: Switzerland was a neutral in the war, and the suits against its banks marked the first time in half a century that the Swiss were confronted with their mixed wartime record. **********In contrast, successive generations of Germans have wrestled with their wartime legacy. Mr. Hombach noted today that, since Germany's surrender in 1945, the Government has paid $140 billion marks, or about $80 billion at current exchange rates, in war reparations and aid. **********But there has never been a settlement with German companies, including those who forced Eastern Europeans to work in German war factories for little or no wages, or those who worked as slave laborers in the death camps. **********Many of those victims were working for the Government, and one of the unresolved questions is whether the German Parliament will create a fund of its own, or contribute to the one financed by industry. **********The German announcement, after a long day of negotiations on Monday at the State Department, won praise from the World Jewish Congress, which pressed the Swiss case and has been a central player in the negotiations with Germany. ''It is extremely encouraging,'' said Israel Singer, who heads the organization, ''that they seem sincere in reaching moral and material restitution.'' **********But lawyers for plantiffs in the suits -- who have often been at odds with the World Jewish Congress -- were far more cautious. Several lawyers for plaintiffs in class-action lawsuits against German companies over Holocaust-related claims said that a meeting here with Mr. Hombach on Monday night had marked the beginning of a dialogue, but that it was premature to say that any kind of agreement was in the offing. **********The German Government is apparently hopeful that State Department officials, led by Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary for Business and Economic Affairs, will find a mechanism that will allow the Holocaust-related claims to be resolved outside the courtroom. One possibility is a bilateral treaty between the United States and Germany terminating the claims once the new fund is established, an issue that Mr. Hombach said would be discussed at the White House on Thursday in a meeting between Mr. Shroder and Mr. Clinton. **********It is unclear whether a bilateral treaty would completely protect the German firms. Many of the claims are being brought on behalf of former forced laborers from countries like Poland who would not be be affected by any bilateral agreement between this country and Germany. **********The talks to reach a settlement are bound to be difficult, given the competing interests of Jewish groups, plantiffs and lawyers, some of whom are still haggling over their fees for the settlement with Swiss banks. **********The German firms have an extraordinary incentive to come to some kind of settlement, especially now with the Euro, the new common European currency, encouraging expanded operations around the world. And no company has a stronger interest in a settlement than Deutsche Bank, which acknowledged last week that it had provided much of the financing for the construction of the Auschwitz death camp. **********Deutsche Bank is trying to complete acquisition of Bankers Trust Company, one of the world's largest financial services firms. Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf Breuer, held talks with the World Jewish Congress and other groups here on Monday, leading Mr. Singer to declare that he would not object to the merger while the talks were under way. **********But New York City's comptroller, Alan Hevesi, who was instrumental in pushing Swiss banks to a settlement after he organized a threatened boycott of the banks, said he was not yet ready to step out of the way of the Deutsche Bank combination with Bankers Trust. **********''The good news is there is the beginning of an agreement to set up a process to come to a global settlement of all the remaining issues between Holocaust survivors and heirs and German institutions,'' he said. ''In the meantime, I continue to believe that federal and state officials should take no action on the proposed merger between Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust until these issues are fully resolved.''"

When an ambulance drove into the main entrance, many in the crowd gasped and whispered ''Jesus.'' **********Later in the evening, the Pope made a brief appearance at the window of the bishop's house to reassure the hundreds of young people gathered there for a pop music festival in his honor. Smiling, but speaking with difficulty in a hoarse voice, he said, ''I am so grateful to you for your presence and the concert. Let us sing, 'Mary, Queen of Poland.' '' He led them in the hymn, waved and then said, ''Good night.'' **********A few hours earlier, Mr. Navarro-Valls appeared on a Polish news program and said the Pope was feeling ''well, taking into consideration that he has a slight fever.'' **********He said that it had not yet been decided whether the Pope would be able to visit his hometown, Wadowice, on Wednesday, but that the planned canonization of a 13th-century Polish queen would take place. The Pope can confer sainthood from his residence, and does not need to attend the ceremony in person. **********Mr. Navarro-Valls also said he could not confirm whether the Pope would go through with his freshly hatched plan to visit Armenia after Poland. But a spokesman for the Armenian Orthodox Church in America, which helped arrange the visit to the church's ailing patriarch, Karekin I, said the Vatican had let their church know that the Pope would not be stopping in Armenia on Friday on his way back to Rome. **********The 79-year-old Pope has canceled Vatican events for health reasons before, and in 1994 was forced to postpone a trip to the United States after falling and breaking his thigh bone. But in his previous 87 foreign trips, he only canceled a public appearance once, in Peru in 1985. **********The cancellation tonight was particularly crushing to Cracow's residents. The ancient city, the spiritual capital of Poland, is where the young Karol Wojtyla secretly studied for the priesthood during the Nazi occupation and where he was the Archbishop from 1963 until his election to become Pope in Rome in 1978. **********The Pope would not easily give up celebrating Mass here. But as Mr. Navarro-Valls explained it, ''Even the Pope has to obey someone, and in this case, it is his doctor.'' **********The Mass was covered live by Polish state television. When the Pope's absence was announced, an announcer told viewers ''to pray for the health of the Holy Father.'' **********''I'm just waiting -- I cannot say for what,'' said Kazimiera Witek, 48, a social worker in Cracow, who stood outside the bishop's residence in the early afternoon. ''I don't expect him to appear. It's better for him to rest.'' Archbishop Wojtyla officiated at her confirmation in 1965, and like so many other Cracow natives, she feels like she knows him personally. **********She had first heard the news at the Mass, when it was announced over a loudspeaker. ''It was raining so hard I couldn't hear the announcement,'' she recalled. ''People whispered it to each other from group to group. It was such a shock.'' **********Franciszek Cardinal Macharski, who replaced John Paul II as Archbishop of Cracow, delivered the Pope's homily. ''Now our thoughts are directed to the Holy Father,'' he said, ''who, as I have said, will be saying Mass at this time in the chapel, in unity with our prayers.'' The congregation listened silently under a sea of umbrellas. **********Since he arrived in Poland for a grueling 13-day visit, the Pope, who usually walks with a cane, has looked tired but has spoken in a firm voice. He has often strayed from his prepared remarks to make puns and homey jokes in his native language. **********He slipped last Saturday morning and cut his head, requiring three stitches that were administered by his personal doctor, Renato Buzzonetti. Asked if the fever is connected to the fall, Mr. Navarro-Valls said, ''absolutely not.'' **********The Pope, who never fully recovered from the 1981 assassination attempt, was operated on in 1992 for a benign intestinal tumor, and had an appendectomy in 1996. **********He broke his shoulder in a fall in November 1993 and broke his thigh bone after slipping in the bathroom in April 1994, postponing a trip to the United States until October 1995. On Christmas Day 1995 he suddenly interrupted his traditional blessing, broadcast live from Saint Peter's, when he was overcome by nausea. Last Feb. 3 he canceled a general audience in Rome; the Vatican said he had the flu. **********During the last few years, the Pope has shown increasing difficulty walking, and other symptoms, most notably the trembling of his left hand, have become obvious. Officials say privately that he has Parkinson's disease, but the Vatican has never confirmed it. The Pope does not like to be coddled, and he frequently brushes off aides who try to help him. **********On Monday the Pope braved gray skies and chill winds at a prayer service in Sosnowiec, a mining town in northeast Poland.

According to a study published this week in the journal Cancer, more than a third of the medical sites scrutinized had not been subjected to peer review. And at least 6 percent of them contained wrong information. **********Dr. J. Sybil Biermann, an orthopedic oncologist, and three colleagues at the University of Michigan conducted the study. They reviewed nearly 400 Web pages retrieved by four search engines after they searched variations of the words ''Ewing sarcoma,'' a form of bone cancer that occurs in children and teen-agers. **********A few sites, for example, overstated or understated the survival rate among those with the disease, which experts estimate to be 70 percent to 75 percent. The researchers found that the site of Encyclopaedia Britannica said the mortality rate was 95 percent. Such information could lead a parent away from worthwhile therapy, Dr. Biermann wrote. ''The devastating effect these postings would have on vulnerable patients is incalculable,'' she added. **********Tom Panelas, a spokesman for Encyclopaedia Britannica, said the company planned to fix the problem by posting a new article or deleting the passage about the mortality rate. He added that Britannica would update its entries on cancer this year. **********The Internet, Dr. Biermann said in an interview, is changing the dynamics of traditional medicine. ''It used to be that the physicians deliver the information, the patient accepts it, and that is that,'' she said. Now, ''in many cases physicians are not even the primary information provider.'' Dr. Biermann recommends that patients ask doctors for their interpretations of what shows up on line and that doctors refer patients to reputable, peer-reviewed sites. ''Anybody can put information on the Internet about any medical condition,'' she said.   LISA GUERNSEY"

Summers describe the new conditions Russia must meet to receive continued international aid, the head of the country's central bank said his country was ''being treated like whipping boys'' by Washington and suggested that he would resist intensive audits of Russia's books. **********The comments by Viktor Gerashchenko, a wily veteran of Russia's shifting political scene who also ran the Soviet Union's central bank, marked the first time that Russia has openly and harshly criticized the extensive new auditing demanded by Washington before lending new money to Moscow through the International Monetary Fund. **********But American officials said Mr. Gerashchenko's outburst -- in which he suggested that the new restrictions on lending to Russia were chiefly a product of Washington politics -- was in sharp contrast to his behavior during the meeting with Mr. Summers. Several suggested that he may have been playing to a domestic audience in Russia, where the accusations of money laundering and the demands for new audits have smacked of more American interference in the running of Russia's chaotic economy. **********His criticism of the United States also runs counter to the message that Russia's Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, has been delivering here. Mr. Ivanov was asked by Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to reassure American officials, news media and other groups that Moscow is strongly interested in cracking down on corruption and welcomes international scrutiny. **********''It's fair to say,'' a senior Administration official said, ''that they don't have their talking points in full agreement.'' **********In contrast to Mr. Ivanov's promises of cooperation, Mr. Gerashchenko, speaking to reporters after meeting with Mr. Summers, said he was already providing the fund with as much information as it needs. **********''We can improve the technology once,'' he said, ''but why should we have to account for everything every day? Do we have to publish our accounts in the gutter press or at official councils?'' **********Among the American demands, which were incorporated in a financial communique issued by the finance ministers of the Group of 7  industrialized nations on Saturday night, Russia must agree to quarterly audits of its central bank reserves, the public money that is a key measure of the Government's fiscal health and a major factor in the value of the ruble. **********The fund was surprised by the discovery last year that the central bank was linked to an offshore investment company in the Channel Island of Jersey and that the bank had misreported its asset levels to the fund. The offshore company, Fimaco, was acquired by a subsidiary of the central bank during Mr. Gerashchenko's previous tenure as central bank chief, although the Fimaco operations that drew most attention to date fell during the 1994-98 period when he did not head the central bank. **********Mr. Summers continued his public warnings to Russia today, repeating the line he took at the opening of a Congressional inquiry last week into corruption, money laundering and the still-unsubstantiated charges that I.M.F. funds had been illegally diverted. **********''We are concerned about Russia,'' Mr. Summers said. ''The capacity of the I.M.F. and the World Bank to help bring about effective policies depends on the will and capacity of Russian authorities and the Russian people to carry forward reforms in their national interests.'' He specifically said it was ''critical'' that Russia develop ''adequate safeguards to ensure that funds provided by'' the bank and the fund ''are used for their intended purpose.'' **********As the two men sparred from a distance, Russian officials on the sidelines of the annual meetings here of the World Bank and the I.M.F. said they did not know when they would receive an additional dose of aid that had been scheduled for release this month. It is essentially money that will be used to pay back the fund for interest due on past loans -- in this case, about $370 million -- and as an additional safeguard the money will never actually enter Russia. Instead, the I.M.F. will transfer it from one fund to another; it is akin to getting a loan from a bank to pay one's mortgage from that bank for the month."

In the latest such partnerships, Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, and Best Buy, the nation's largest electronics merchant, both announced far-reaching alliances with Internet companies yesterday. **********The details of the deals differed considerably, but the point was the same: retailers are looking for fast ways to help their online stores, and everyone is looking to tap the two-thirds of Americans who are not yet online, but are expected to get there soon. Real-world merchants are thought to be especially influential with the mass-market customer, who is less technologically knowledgeable than today's high-income Internet user and will be looking for guidance about venturing into e-commerce. **********''Now that 50 percent of Americans are outfitted with computers and the majority of them are online,'' said Richard Schultze, Best Buy's chairman, ''the next wave of new users is coming from those consumers that are less knowledgeable and are somewhat less prepared to spend a lot of money, but don't want to be left out. Those are the consumers that retailers like ourselves have a strong relationship with.'' **********Analysts say the recent spate of deals tacitly acknowledges a new balance of power between Internet companies and traditional stores, which just a year ago were being dismissed as dinosaurs. ''Six months ago Circuit City would have had to pay $50 million for the agreement they got for free from AOL'' on Wednesday, said Gary Balter, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. He was referring to a deal in which Circuit City Stores, the nation's No. 2 electronics retailer, agreed to promote America Online's Internet service in its stores in return for AOL's featuring Circuit City's online store as an ''anchor tenant'' on its shopping page. **********''These deals follow a pattern going on all over the Internet, which is the realization that online companies need to relate to people who spend their lives both online and off-line,'' said Scott Heiferman, founder of iTraffic, an Internet advertising company recently bought by Agency.com. **********To be sure, such retail-Internet partnerships are not a new phenomenon. AOL, in particular, has aggressively mined the retail channel for customers for half a decade now -- most notably through Blockbuster Video and Barnes & Noble. But the teaming-up is certainly gaining steam, and the size and the scope of the partnerships are growing significantly. **********The deal with the broadest scope is the pact Wal-Mart signed yesterday with AOL, by far the largest Internet service provider, with nearly 20 million subscribers. Wal-Mart attracts some 100 million customers to its stores each week, and analysts estimate that only 25 percent of those shoppers now have access to the Internet at home. In the short term, the two giants will offer low-cost software that will allow Wal-Mart customers to gain access to the Web through a joint Web site. The financial details were not disclosed, but analysts said AOL would keep the fees but pay Wal-Mart a bounty for each customer who signs up for the joint service through Wal-Mart. **********More interestingly, the two giants said they would also work together to bring access to underserved rural customers. Wal-Mart estimates that over half of its customers live in rural areas where they cannot get access to the Web through a local phone call. **********While the Wal-Mart deal might reach the largest number of Americans without access, it is but one approach to converting the unwired masses. Best Buy agreed today to market Microsoft's newest wave of digital products and Internet access service in return for a $200 million investment. Best Buy reaches a smaller total customer base than Kmart or Wal-Mart, but its sales staff specializes in educating shoppers on complicated home electronics. **********On Wednesday, Kmart agreed to create a co-branded Web shopping site and Internet access software with Yahoo, a leading Web portal. Kmart plans to give away that software, a deal that might be particularly appealing to low-income customers. Kmart says that some 30 million customers shop in its stores each week and that only 51 percent now use the Web. **********In return for hawking the co-branded services, the traditional merchants will have their Web sites featured prominently on the sites of their Internet partners. Wal-Mart in particular is looking to propel its Web site, which has not been a star performer, into the top five most trafficked sites. The giant retailer has been losing sales to virtual retailers like eToys and Amazon.com in toys, books, and entertainment and, analysts say, wants to stem the tide. **********To be sure, not all traditional merchants have joined this cross-marketing craze. Among the big players who are obviously absent in this love-fest are Target, the chic discounter that is a unit of Dayton Hudson, and Sears, Roebuck, the second-largest retailer, which once spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an unsuccessful, decade-long online foray as a co-owner of Prodigy. Analysts agree that it is not a deadly sin for earthbound retailers to stay out of this game. ''If you are Sears and you don't have the agreement, it is not that crucial, you are not going to die,'' asserts Mr. Balter of Donaldson, Lufkin. **********But a smart-looking Web strategy can be a means toward making a land strategy more competitive. ''Deals like this drive up your stock price so that you can increase budgets for online or on-land development,'' said Burt Flickinger III, the managing director of Reach Marketing, a Connecticut-based consulting firm. ''That gives a retailer a huge strategic advantage.''"

''What we do benefits the everyday life of Beijing residents.'' **********Ms. Yang, 36, moved here a decade ago from a village in southern China. Along with scores of other vendors, virtually all of them migrants, she sat along this street in western Beijing next to a pile of concrete rubble the other day -- all that remained of the stall she had built for her shoe-repair business, which she had been forced to tear down. **********She and the other vendors were hoping to catch a few final customers before city workers came to erase the last traces of this formerly bustling market. **********The Dragon Temple market, like hundreds of others around the city that have suffered similar fates, consisted of about a quarter-mile of permanent stalls offering goods and services like produce, watch and shoe repair, toys and compact disks. **********The demolition of such street markets this spring is officially described as part of a ''beautification'' program as Beijing prepares for celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic on Oct. 1. **********But even more, official pronouncements have made clear, it is also part of a master plan to cut the number of rural migrants living and working in the city. **********''Things are getting so tough in Beijing now,'' said Ge You, another displaced vendor at Dragon Temple,  who had sold fruits and vegetables. ''You are not allowed to run your business.'' **********Mr. Ge, 45, is responding to his troubles just the way the city hopes: seven years after he moved here with his wife and daughter from a poor farming county in Henan Province, he is giving up. Having lost their foothold in Beijing, the family is moving back to their village despite an utter lack of prospects there. **********But experience and economic logic suggest that many other migrants will find ways to stay on and that newcomers, visible any day huddled around Beijing train stations, will continue to stream in. **********They come for the chance to make money, despite the lack of legal rights that is being abundantly demonstrated this spring. Until the mid-1980's internal migration was all but impossible since work, housing and food rations were all tied to a strict system of residence permits. Then, as social controls loosened and the economy diversified, the Government began to allow cities to issue temporary permits for workers, spawning a vast ''floating population'' of rural-to-urban migrants. **********The city is also putting tight new restrictions on the jobs that migrants can hold. Their continued employment in cleaning and sanitation jobs will be just fine, but Government offices and companies, still the majority of employers here, will be strictly limited in the number of migrants they can hire. **********The new policies amount to a heavy three-pronged attack on the rural people, believed to number more than three million, who live in Beijing working as vendors, street sweepers, dish washers, construction workers, building guards, maids or any other kind of menial laborer. Beijing officials say the population of permanent legal residents is 12.7 million. **********According to official estimates, 1.8 million migrants are legally registered to work, some of them here with families, some single. At least half a million people more are believed to be here illegally, working as they dodge the occasional police sweep. Regardless of legal status, some come for a few years to save up money while others hope to stay for good even if they can never get the schooling, housing and other rights of a permanent resident. **********The goal of the current campaign, officials say, is to reduce the number of legal migrant workers to 1.5 million as well as to drive out many of the illegal visitors. **********Beijing officials and residents often use cliches to describe the migrants. In a recent newspaper article, the substandard housing that many rent is described as ''dirty and disorderly'' and ''an environmental menace and a threat to public safety.'' Migrants are constantly blamed for the city's rising crime rate, though no reliable figures have been published. **********This is not the first time Beijing and other large Chinese cities have tried to restrict migrants and if the city achieves any success it may only reflect the economic slowdown. By definition, the migrants come because they can make more money than back home, where most were unneeded hands on overcrowded farms. They find work in the city because there is a genuine demand for their services. **********Some, such as skilled construction workers, make good money here. But the vast majority work in jobs that no Beijing resident will take, for wages -- perhaps $40 to $80 a month, sometimes with a dorm room but no other benefits -- that most city residents accustomed to the ''iron rice bowl'' security of state employment would sneer at. **********Now, with a growing share of state employees laid off, political leaders preach about the need for residents to change their attitudes and to take positions as maids or guards or laborers. One of the implicit motives in expelling migrants is to open up more low-end jobs for permanent residents. But the migrants are skeptical. **********''Please ask the Government if Beijing residents are willing to ride those bicycle carts that transport most of their fruits and vegetables,'' said Mr. Ge, the former produce vendor. ''Beijing people don't want to do the work, but they want to eat.'' **********Ms. Yang, the shoe repairer, said she would try to find another location where she could work unmolested, but if that did not work out, she might have to consider leaving Beijing too for her home in Zhejiang Province. She refused to say what work her husband was doing in Beijing. **********''Whether it's fair or unfair,'' Ms. Yang said of the demolition campaign, ''there's nowhere for us to go to complain.''"

One of the agent's responsibilities is to match the user's preferences. Software agents take initiative, learn from the habits of their clients and adapt to the market. **********At the M.I.T. Media Laboratory, Professor Maes founded and directs the Software Agents Group and holds the Sony Corporation Career Development Chair. Two of her many projects have led to commercial spinoffs that represent the two leading types of shopping bots. The first was Firefly, introduced in 1995, which helps make individual recommendations for taste-based products like compact disks, books and films. The other is Frictionless, which went into service in August on the Lycos portal and other Web sites. **********Frictionless is designed to shop for the best price and service on less-frequently bought products, like cars or camcorders. **********Firefly is Professor Maes's best-known spinoff. It was one of the first shopping bots to use intelligent agents and collaborative filtering. Developed in the early 1990's, Firefly's software began as a site called Helpful On-Line Music Recommendations, or HOMR, where users could receive guidance in finding music recommendations. Users rated a series of CD's to create individual profiles, which were compared with profiles of other users with similar tastes to generate suggestions for music the user might enjoy. **********''One of the beauties of these kinds of systems is that some notions we held before of how people fit into certain stereotypes are proven to be wrong,'' Professor Maes said. ''On Firefly, for instance, the system kept telling us something that seemed strange. Ask what else classical music buyers like, and it would say the Beatles.'' **********In 1995, the HOMR project was spun off and incorporated first as Agents, then under the friendlier name Firefly. Other sites, including Reel.com, adopted similar techniques to help people choose films. Some licensed the software from Firefly. Then, in April 1998, Firefly was sold to Microsoft, guaranteeing its influence across one of the most powerful sets of on-line sites. **********Firefly and other collaborative filtering systems take advantage of the knowledge and tastes of customers. Sometimes the user fills in a form on line. At other times, the agent learns from a person's buying or browsing patterns, as tracked by software from companies like Doubleclick. **********A familiar nondigital comparison is with the Zagat Survey of restaurants, which is based on reports and ratings by diners. A new site, Deja.com, expands on this idea: ''Consumer reporting from actual consumers'' is its slogan. It offers information on a variety of products, including VCR's and computer printers. **********But true electronic word of mouth is more personalized, Professor Maes said. A college student might be presented only with the restaurants that fit his or her budget; a diner on a low-cholesterol diet might get a different list. Such recommendation options, including those produced by Firefly's competitor, Net Advantage for Barnesandnoble.com, are probably the most familiar of the new bots. **********Amazon.com for instance, offers Instant Recommendations based on past purchases. On its music pages, an agent is in effect tucked behind a button labeled ''mood matcher.'' There, you can click on categories that include ''party,'' ''driving,'' ''dancing,'' ''Sunday morning'' and ''feeling depressed.'' Punch ''depressed'' and you will get subcategories like ''got dumped'' and ''won't stop raining.'' Click ''crashed your car'' and the music suggestion is ''All The Rage'' by the Kronos Quartet. **********''This type of recommendation technology only works for domains where people buy on a regular basis,'' Professor Maes said. ''It's good for areas where it is hard to put into words what it is you like or dislike. It's great for books or music, but not, say, for a car, which you might buy only every four to eight years.'' **********For those kinds of products, a different kind of agent technology, like Frictionless, works better. Frictionless also grew from Professor Maes's work at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory. It searches on-line shopping sites for products with specific features at the best price. **********For example, on Frictionless, someone interested in buying a laptop computer chooses among a set of user profiles, with names that include ''road warrior,'' ''budget shopper'' and ''telecommuter.'' Each profile provides a list of product features, among them weight, speed and memory, as well as information on the vendor relating to warranty, availability and delivery. To further personalize the search, the user can rely on the preset profile or edit it, rating factors like screen size and product warranty on a scale of ''not important'' to ''very important.'' **********Frictionless is so named because it seeks to remove the friction from searching for and comparing products. The name could also refer to the friction that early shopping bots often encountered in dealing with on-line merchants. The first bot was Andersen Consulting's Bargain Finder, introduced in 1995. Current sites include Mysimon.com, Advantage and Bottomdollar.com. In the beginning, bots searched by price only, and many selling sites prohibited access to their price lists. The sellers wanted users to view their pages and advertisements directly. They also might have believed they were misrepresented by comparisons with other sites where prices might omit shipping or other costs. **********The current shopping bots are called second generation, which implicitly recognizes the limits of the first generation. Frictionless refers to its software as a ''value-comparison engine,'' while its competitor, Mysimon, describes itself as a ''virtual learning agent.'' **********One element of real-world shopping that on-line sites generally lack is the impulse purchase. Retailers have long celebrated the ''serendipity factor.'' For example, the buyer browsing in a bookstore may be intrigued by a title he's never heard of while the CD shopper may pick up a disk by a Brazilian artist new to her and play it at a listening station. **********Can agents and bots be programmed for serendipity? **********''You can build in serendipity either in a narrow way, with a randomizer to make suggestions, or by giving customers things outside the current taste profile that are popular with some portion of their taste mates,'' Professor Maes said. **********Some users may feel their individuality challenged by the idea that others share their preferences; that something as personal as taste can be rendered in cold, hard algorithms. But the greatest concern is privacy. **********''This is a major issue that deserves public discussion,'' Professor Maes said. The more an agent knows about you, the more useful it can be. **********But while some shopping bot companies promise not to sell information to other companies, others give away their software and plan to make money from selling the information they gather on shopping patterns. **********A survey by Jupiter Communications, an industry tracking company, suggested that more than 60 percent of shoppers remained wary of giving information to an on-line site. **********Firefly hired an accounting firm to certify its privacy practices, and Professor Maes was an early backer of proposed industry standards for privacy. The so-called Platform for Privacy Preferences protocols are  under discussion by the nonprofit World Wide Web Consortium and enjoy the support of  Microsoft, MCI Worldcom,  AT&T, I.B.M., Netscape, Oracle and other companies. **********BUT even if these standards -- which involve encrypting information and  obtaining permission from consumers to transfer personal information -- become accepted, on-line shoppers may not feel comfortable. **********On Aug. 18, just two days after Frictionless went on line, Firefly's site vanished, swallowed by Microsoft's Passport shopping site, which will begin this fall. Many of Firefly's users were dismayed despite Microsoft's assurances that privacy and other policies would remain in place. **********Trust is vital to making software agents work well. **********For Professor Maes, agents have much more to offer than prices and suggestions, and many applications only now being dreamed of at M.I.T. expand the role of agents. Other future agents might be linked to smart appliances, and will order milk before it runs out. **********But Professor Maes likes to speak of agents leveraging the knowledge and experience of many people to help individuals. ''Intelligence augmentation'' is what she calls her next efforts. **********One of Professor Maes's projects at M.I.T. seeks to bring together people who have not met but have similar interests.  The program uses a survey of potentially sensitive information, like people's mail, their personal files or lists of their interests. **********It's easy to imagine how the program  might be useful to link scientists around the world for academic conferences, but its working name suggests an even more dramatic matchmaking possibility: **********It is called Yenta."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/08/news/exmonopoly-battles-competitors-bezeq-israel-faces-realities-of-market.html,Neal Sandler,1999-10-08,,1458,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Ex-Monopoly Battles Competitors : Bezeq Israel Faces Realities of Market,Ex-Monopoly Battles Competitors : Bezeq Israel Faces Realities of Market," **********JERUSALEMโ                     Until the mid-'80s, getting a telephone in Israel was no easy task. It often required protekzia, or contacts in Hebrew. Hundreds of thousands of people were on waiting lists to receive phone lines. In some areas, the wait could last for years. But that all changed in 1985 when the Israeli government decided to turn the phone service, then a division of the Ministry of Posts, into a state-owned company. **********Huge investments by Bezeq Israel Telecom in the late '80s and early '90s transformed Israel into an advanced telecommunications market. Now Israelis can order phones and have them installed in a matter of days. **********For more than a decade, the state-owned company enjoyed a monopoly status. But competition finally arrived in 1996 with the entry to the mobile phone market of CellCom Israel Ltd., a joint venture of the Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp., Brazil's wealthy Safra family and Discount Investment Corp. of Israel. A year and a half later, the international call market opened up. **********""Israelis now enjoy some of the lowest rates for mobile and international calls,"" said Alexa Perlmutter, a telecommunications analyst at Nessuah-Zannex Ltd., a Tel Aviv-based investment bank. In January, a third mobile operator, Partner Communications Ltd., a joint venture between Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and several Israeli partners, launched the first GSM, or Global System for Mobile communications, service in Israel. The company entered a market where mobile penetration is already above 40 percent, and among the highest in the world. **********The market share of the first mobile phone company, Pelephone Communications Ltd., owned jointly by Bezeq and Motorola Inc., has dipped to 40 percent. In the international call market, Bezeq's share has fallen to around 50 percent. ""The 80 percent drop in international rates has only been partially offset by the large increase in demand,"" notes Daniel Carasso, Israel analyst for Goldman, Sachs. **********The new Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to implement full deregulation of the telecommunications market some time next year, with the opening up of the local call market. A dispute between the Israeli government and the cable operators over demands for compensation for the entry of satellite broadcasting services into the market has further complicated full deregulation. **********The loss of its last remaining monopoly is expected to clear the way for the sale by the government of its remaining 54 percent stake in Bezeq to a consortium, which is likely to include a major foreign telecommunications player and local partners. **********The expected fight for control of Bezeq intensified in early September with the announcement by Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain that it was looking to sell its 20 percent stake in the Israeli operator (a 13 percent stake and a 7 percent option). Several leading Israeli companies, including Koor Industries Ltd., Israel Corp. and Aurec Software Ltd., have expressed interest in Bezeq. ""The competition for control is expected to lead to a substantial premium for the company,"" predicts Zeev Holtzman, president of the Giza Group, a Tel Aviv-based investment bank. **********Bezeq's new owners will be faced with an even more competitive market than already exists. ""We're planning to issue a tender by the end of the year to select four fixed wireless access and local multi-point distribution service operators,"" says Daniel Rossene, director-general of Israel's communications ministry. **********- **********ALL OF the country's cable operators as well as two of the three mobile operators are looking to enter the market. ""Cable and local wireless loop operators could be substantial players in the market within a few years,"" Mr. Carasso predicts. But others believe that Israel's situation will resemble that of Britain, where competition had a limited impact on British Telecom's dominant position. **********To meet the challenge, Bezeq is investing heavily in new technologies. A key component of the company's strategy is asymmetric digital subscriber line, or ADSL, technology, which will enable the company to offer fast Internet access and video on demand. **********The deregulation has also enabled Bezeq to enter segments of the market hitherto closed to the state-owned company, including Internet and direct broadcasting from satellite. **********The company entered the Internet market in January and expects to have 50,000 customers by the end of the year. That would position Bezeq behind Netvision and Internet Zahav. **********So far, Bezeq's income and profitability have been hit hard by competition. After years of rapid growth in the early '90s, the company has seen newcomers capture large chunks of its market share. Income has remained stable at around $2 billion in recent years, but profits have fallen sharply. In the first half of 1999, profits fell by 85 percent to $10 million compared to the same period in the previous year. **********The competition has forced Bezeq in recent years to streamline its operations. The company's work force has been reduced by 20 percent to 6,800 in the past 18 months. The company is planning to lay off an additional 400 to 500 workers next year. The Israeli Communications Ministry has already announced that it is looking to issue tenders for a fourth and possibly a fifth mobile operator. The ministry is predicting that the number of mobile phones will reach 3 million next year, surpassing the number of fixed lines, now at 2.9 million. **********Most analysts believe that the worst may already be behind for Bezeq. ""We're looking for the profit picture to improve already next year,"" Mr. Holtzman says. And despite the increased competition, Mr. Holtzman and other experts believe Bezeq will continue to play a dominant role in the local telecommunications market. **********NEAL SANDLER is a financial writer based in Jerusalem."

It is increasingly unclear whether the world will be able to raise spending on population policies from $10 billion a year at present to the $17 billion required under the new strategy in the year 2000, or the nearly $22 billion needed by 2015 at a time when Western aid to developing nations is falling. **********''We are having a replay of the differences which surfaced at Cairo by some of the countries who feel they lost out then,'' acknowledged Bangladesh's representative, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury, chairman of the review conference, which will reconvene next month to complete its work. **********''We are sorry to see a meeting that was supposed to take stock of how countries are implementing the Cairo program turn into an attempt to renegotiate that program,'' said Anika Rahman, of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, one of the private lobbying groups attending the talks. **********Citing a ''huge gap between promises and performance,'' June Persaud, the Guyanese delegate who spoke for the Group of 77, as the 130 developing member countries of the United Nations call themselves, predicted the industrialized world will  provide only 33 percent of the $5.7 billion it is supposed to contribute to the program by 2000. **********Unlike earlier United Nations efforts to curb population growth, which emphasized numerical targets, the Cairo strategy assumes women will automatically limit the size of their families as they become healthier, richer and more educated and enjoy a higher social status. **********It calls for universal access to reproductive and sexual health care by 2015 as well as universal access to primary education, gender equality and sharp reductions in infant, child and maternal mortality. **********''Cairo marks a shift in emphasis  in population policy from targets and numbers to improving women's lives,'' said Rosalind P. Petchesky, of the International Reproductive Rights Research Action Group. ''You won't stem population growth without bettering the lot of women.'' **********By making the condition of women the key to population control, the Cairo program builds on the results of two earlier big United Nations conferences. **********But instead of using last month's review conference to compare national experiences in carrying out the Cairo program, delegates found themselves locked in a linguistic struggle over what they should say about a number of sensitive subjects in the report they will present to a special session of the United Nations General Assembly in July. **********A loose coalition of conservative Roman Catholic and Muslim countries, led by the Vatican and including Argentina, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile, Libya, Sudan, Algeria and Malta, sought continually to water down commitments made at Cairo. **********They balked, for instance, at a pledge to insure abortions are safe for women legally entitled to them. **********They sought to bolster parental authority at the expense of educating young people about sex and providing them with independent health care. And they opposed any endorsement of so-called ''emergency contraception,'' which destroys a fertilized egg before it becomes implanted in the uterine wall, making a women clinically pregnant. **********In addition, this group sought unsuccessfully to block private pressure groups like the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy from attending next month's reconvened conference."

https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/09/news/kinder-dyes-bolster-a-global-trend-that-appeals-to-all-ages-now-its.html,Michele Loyer,1999-10-09,,1617,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Kinder Dyes Bolster a Global Trend That Appeals to All Ages : Now It's Natural to Color Hair,Kinder Dyes Bolster a Global Trend That Appeals to All Ages : Now It's Natural to Color Hair," **********PARISโ                     Not so long ago, only ""loose"" (or aging) women dyed their hair. Today, fewer and fewer women can remember their original hair color. Globally, hair coloring is turning into a fashion phenomenon. **********Over the past five years, sales of hair coloring products โ for professional as well as home use โ have exploded. In 1998, L'Oreal, the leading manufacturer of hair products, announced a global increase in sales of 12 percent while Wella, one of its German competitors, reported double-digit growth for 1999. **********""During the past five years, our sales figures for dyeing products have increased 25 percent,"" said Caroline Thibault, product manager with the German hair products company Schwarzkopf. It is a phenomenon that is affecting even traditionally color-resistant Asian countries: Japanese and South Korean women are now enthusiastically highlighting their glossy black hair with red streaks. **********The main reason for the spectacular rise in hair coloring is the profound change in consumers' attitudes. ""Coloring"" has replaced ""dyeing,"" a word with the negative connotation of camouflage. **********""Today, women use hair coloring to emphasize their personality, or just for fun, as another fashion accessory,"" according to Bertrand Fontaine, marketing director for L'Oreal Professionnel France, a division of L'Oreal cosmetic group. **********If ""50-something"" women with graying hair still represent the largest segment of hair coloring consumers, manufacturers are now banking on a younger clientele: women between the ages of 25 and 40 with little or no gray hair. They are using hair coloring as they do fashion: just for the pleasure of changing their looks. **********Another strategic target for the industry is the 18- to 25-year-old group. Used to the culture of ""zapping"" and quick changes, this group has a playful attitude toward hair coloring. Both men and women favor blatantly artificial shades, changed frequently in accordance with the latest trends or to emulate their favorite pop singer or fashion model. Often, paradoxically, the inspiration for a new range of colors comes from natural hair shades. **********A model booker at the Elite agency said: ""Right now, Irish-looking models with a lot of curly red hair and freckled skin are very much in demand for fashion, while blondes dominate the luxury products market. But the emerging trend with cosmetic companies is the fair-skinned, blue- or green-eyed brunette."" **********The redhead craze was translated by the hair industry into a complete range of reddish tones. Flamboyant copper, russet and warm chestnut brown are favorites for the autumn/winter 1999-2000 season. **********Apart from basic shades, which can number as many as 100, manufacturers put out an average of five promotional colors each season. The new shades are selected according to market surveys and the recommendations of color and fashion consultants. The intensity of the color range varies according to the cultural characteristics of each market: more intense for the American and Southern European markets, toned down for Northern Europe. **********Annie Gandaio, Revlon's international marketing manager for new products, said: ""The richness and audacity of our color range is an important part of our image. We try to be the forerunners in term of colors."" **********But the increased sophistication of their color ranges is only one element in the manufacturers' strategy. The real battle between brand names takes place at the technological level. A new quality awareness at the consumer level and the need to capture a younger audience have bolstered technological research, resulting in a new generation of ""close-to-nature"" dyeing products. Technical improvements now allow manufacturers to claim that dyeing actually makes the hair shinier and healthier looking. **********""The great breakthrough in hair coloring came in the early '90s with the semi-permanent colors,"" said Fontaine of L'Oreal. Less aggressive than traditional dyeing products containing ammonia, the new generation of products helped to capture the 30- to 50-year-old bracket, a generation of women who accept hair coloring only if the artifice looks natural. The tone-on-tone, semi-permanent coloring adds depth and intensity to the hair's original color and requires little or no oxidation, or bleaching. Discreet and natural but long-lasting, the color can also resist many shampoos. **********- **********IN ORDER to keep up with women's demand for ""natural"" effects, professional dyeing techniques also had to become more sophisticated and more inventive. Pascale Thomas, 34, a colorist at the Look Lemon hair salon, describes a good colorist as someone who has learned from past mistakes. ""A natural talent with color is important,"" she said, ""but what counts most is patience and repetition."" **********The new generation of hair colorists no longer stands in the hairdressers' shadow, as was traditionally the case in most hair salons. Hair coloring is beginning to be acknowledged, if not as an art, at least as a difficult technique. Most colorists have learned how to mix colors by watching a more experienced colleague and have then developed their own recipes. **********Rodolphe, who recently left Alexandre's prestigious salon to open his ""color only"" Parisian premises, said: ""Until very recently, we hardly existed as a profession. Each of us had to invent his own technique."" **********Another young tenor of the profession, Christophe Robin, became an immediate success after being discovered by fashion editors. He now shares his time between his private clients and photography studios. **********Individualistic in his approach to hair coloring, Robin does not follow color trends. ""Most women want to dye their hair not to change drastically but to look younger or more beautiful. They call on me to improve their own individual looks,"" he said. He picks and mixes the best out of each product line. **********According to most colorists, beyond the technical know-how, the most important part of their trade is a keen understanding of women's psychology. **********Robin said, ""I always try to interpret what's behind a woman's demand for a new color. I sometimes refuse to comply with a client's request for a dramatic change. I believe in treading lightly."" **********MICHELE LOYER is a free-lance journalist based in Paris."

''They are responsible. They know that the whole society is changing now.'' **********In what he called a ''national unity Cabinet,'' Mr. Wahib mixed political affiliations but avoided any figures publicly linked to the corrupt practices of the past. The Cabinet appeared to reflect public demands for reform, and the President put new emphasis on human rights by creating a special ministry. **********''There are some compromises,'' he said, relaxed and sometimes joking as he presented his Government in a televised ceremony. But he said he expected the public to find his new team ''very satisfactory.'' **********Foreign investors and political analysts said they were not sure whether the new lineup heralded the stability that they have been waiting for. They cited the Mixmaster nature of the Cabinet, the critical nature of Indonesia's political and economic problems and the continuing questions about Mr. Wahid's health and leadership abilities. **********So far, though, there seemed to be agreement that Mr. Wahid's first steps since taking office on Wednesday had been positive. **********Moving quickly on another sensitive issue, Mr. Wahid said that the leader of newly independent East Timor, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, would be welcome to visit Jakarta and that he would go to meet him at the airport if he comes. **********He said he had sent a letter to Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations formally notifying him that Indonesia accepted the results of the territory's vote for independence on Aug. 30. The United Nations is preparing to form an interim administration there. **********The Cabinet displays the emerging inclusive style of Mr. Wahid, whose first act as President was to select his chief rival, Megawati Sukarnoputri, as Vice President. She sat beside him today for his televised announcement and then, because he is partly blind, read the Cabinet list on his behalf. **********In a seemingly spontaneous give-and-take with reporters later, he said economic recovery and territorial integrity were his Government's first priorities. **********Local and foreign analysts said the Cabinet was strong on talent but shallow in political experience. Its diversity is a short-term plus, they said, but raised the possibility of longer-term conflicts and paralysis. That is particularly so because Mr. Wahid, 59, who is in poor health, is not known as an aggressive day-to-day manager. **********''It does look like an all-things-to-all-people Cabinet,'' said Eric Bjornlund, director of the Jakarta office of the Carter Center in Atlanta. ''It's an attempt at what has been called a national unity government that in the long term might not be either viable or good for democracy, but perhaps is the right thing to have at this time.'' **********Mr. Wahid, who won the presidency in an electoral assembly through a tortured coalition of competing parties, paid his political debts deftly while including members from a variety of geographical regions, ethnic groups and religions in the broadest-based Cabinet in many years. **********He said the Cabinet was a joint production that included rival leaders who now hold prominent Government positions, as well as the departing Defense Minister and armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto. All share the responsibility for the performance of his Government, he said. **********Financial analysts said that the economic team appeared to be competent but added that it had little choice but to follow the guidelines of the International Monetary Fund and to work to attract foreign investors. **********There were some questions about the commitment to these guidelines of Economic Coordinating Minister Kwik Kian Gie. Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo is a professor with a low political and academic profile and appears to have been appointed as part of a political deal. **********The withdrawal of the military from its strong role in politics is one of the President's most difficult challenges in creating a more democratic society. He appeared to bend over backward to satisfy the army, even as he reduced its prominence. **********The Defense Minister, Juwono Sudarsono, the former Education Minister, is a respected scholar and manager who was once deputy head of an elite military policy institute. **********The new chief of the armed forces, Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto, was General Wiranto's second in command, potentially easing the blow to top army officers who might otherwise have been promoted. The relatively small navy has not been as politically aggressive as the army and is less tainted by corruption and brutality. **********Mr. Wahid also softened his moves by giving General Wiranto a vaguely defined role as a coordinating minister, while removing him from direct political and military control. The general has been identified with the military's measured withdrawal from politics, and he could remain highly influential in his new post. The President moved two of the army's most reform-minded generals into civilian ministerial jobs, also balancing the appointment of Mr. Juwono as Defense Minister."

Some employees may leaf through plan summaries or peruse health-care provider directories to make their choices, but at an increasing number of companies, employees are doing things differently. These tasks are, or soon will be, completed electronically, from the desktop at the click of a mouse, and by the people getting the benefits, not by human resource departments. **********At the Oracle Corporation, the Boeing Company and Charles Schwab & Company, for example, workers surf internal corporate computer networks and Web sites set up by benefit providers to check their 401(k) account balances, switch health-care plans or update W-4 forms, all tasks that were once exclusively the job of human resources employees. Other companies, like the Marriott Corporation and Anheuser-Busch Companies, are using self-service call-in centers that link employees with benefits data; many of these systems present employees with a series of menus that enable them to make benefit choices. **********Known in the industry as employee self-service, this self-help notion is quickly sweeping the workplace, as companies use technology to shift the responsibility for many benefits-related tasks directly to employees. **********Employers embrace the notion as a way to automate their human resources departments, cutting costs and increasing efficiency. Employees either like it or hate it. Some find it empowering to be able to see their files and change their choices. But others find it frustrating to be left to sort out the merits of an insurance plan on their own, trying to decipher the coverage limits described on an insurer's Web site without the benefit of a human being to help explain them. **********That inherent tension leads some observers to question whether low-tech human assistance is better than high-tech self-help in the area of employee benefits, or in at least some parts of the benefits process. And experts and users seem divided on whether self-service systems guarantee employees the depth of information they need to make timely benefits decisions. **********''I've seen corporations try to replace the human touch with technology, and it doesn't always work,'' said Donna Malinak, president and chief executive of Forward Mobility, a management consulting company in Bernardsville, N.J. ''I don't believe that one can completely replace the other.'' **********But one thing is certain: companies are quickly moving in that direction. Automating benefits through Web-based technology, called virtual H.R. (for human resources), is growing fast. Fifty percent of 466 companies surveyed now conduct at least some human resources transactions over the Web, nearly double the rate in 1997, according to a survey conducted last year by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a consulting company in Bethesda, Md. The use of Web-based applications outpaces other methods, like interactive voice-response systems and free-standing kiosks that offer workers access to their files, the survey showed. **********''It's very, very clear that this is where companies are going,'' said Steve McCormick, the virtual H.R. consultant at Watson Wyatt. ''To the extent that it has a network and PC's, I think every company intends to move toward some type of self-service of its H.R. functions.'' **********Cost savings are driving the trend. Mr. McCormick cited a large pharmaceutical company that had moved parts of its benefits information on line through a local corporate network after figuring that it spent $16.40 each time it had to process an address change filed on paper. When the company multiplied that times its estimated 100,000 address changes a year, ''the cost savings become just so obvious,'' he said. **********Moving data on line can also give employees easier access to their benefits files so they do not have to wait for a paper statement. Schlumberger Ltd., an oil-field services company based in New York, offers its 16,000 employees in the United States 24-hour access to personal benefits information through its interactive Web-based system. Employees can conduct investment research, change 401(k) contribution rates or send E-mail to their benefits administrator. **********''The biggest gain is that employees can have access when they need to make a decision,'' said Lillian Petty, Schlumberger's benefits manager for North America. ''There's a difference between pushing information to employees or letting them pull out what they want.'' **********The site, called the Schlumberger Automated Benefits Link, has received an average of 320 visits per day since it opened in May. Next up: full benefits enrollment on line this year. ''Our goal is to have paperless benefits administration,'' Ms. Petty said. **********That is an attractive goal for any business, but can it work for every employee at every company, even those who do not have daily access to personal computers or phones at work? **********Such a shift can present a classic divide between haves and have-nots, people who have studied the trend say: employees with computers have access to information that those on the shop floor do not. In that case, companies must take a different approach. At Schlumberger, for example, 52 self-service kiosks at its manufacturing centers give employees without computers access to the information that is available to other workers on line. **********A similar approach is being taken by Hard Rock Cafe International, a restaurant chain based in Orlando, Fla. It plans to introduce an interactive CD this month that will carry information on all company benefits, including its 401(k) and health plans. The CD's will be sent to its 45 restaurants and played at publicly available monitors in break rooms. Kitchen training is already conducted via interactive CD's at all the restaurants. The videos are interactive; by using touch screens, Hard Rock employees will be able to learn about their benefits programs and monitor the growth of their retirement-plan contributions. **********''We told ourselves that we could continue to do it with our current method -- shipping at least 6,000 benefits kits to employees, holding two to three meetings a year with each restaurant and traveling to and from -- or we could look at our own motto, 'Save the Planet,' and put a stop to all this paper,'' said Anthony Amato, director of compensation and benefits. Mr. Amato estimated that the company used six tons of paper, at a cost of 20 cents per page, to inform employees about benefits each year. ''When we added up how much we were spending,'' he said,  ''it was clear what we needed to do.'' Employees will be able to get answers to benefits questions by entering a personal identification number and password, Mr. Amato said. **********The concept of self-service benefits for employees is not new, but its acceptance has been slowed somewhat by a persistent image problem, Year 2000 compliance problems and by the need for companies to invest in Internet technology. **********''We have more than enough technology to bring this about,'' said Joel Lapointe, vice president for management consulting at the Hunter Group in Baltimore. He said he coined the self-service phrase and developed the concept in the 1980's, and many of his peers in the industry agree with that. ''The roadblock continues to be a culture-acceptance problem,'' he added. **********On one hand, employees who are comfortable with technology enjoy having access to their own information and control over it, and they want more of it, Mr. Lapointe said. ''Employees know that companies have these sets of data about them,'' he said, ''but the source of the data is always the employee -- it all belongs to them.'' **********On the other hand, some workers may think that the trend shifts to the employee  an unwanted chore that used to be management's job, say consultants who have worked on the new systems. **********One person who has studied management and employee benefits is Richard Hadden, president of Corporate Education Systems in Jacksonville, Fla., and co-author of ''Contented Cows Give Better Milk: The Plain Truth About Employee Relations and Your Bottom Line'' (Saltillo Press, 1998). Employees tend to see this newfound empowerment as either ''enablement or abandonment,'' Mr. Hadden said. ''If it enables them to do better things, that's good. If it leaves them feeling abandoned, that can be detrimental. If employees can't use or perceive they can't get what they need, which is so often the case with benefits issues, they'll be frustrated, and abandonment sets in.'' **********Some companies have tried to take steps to address that problem. In 1995, Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., began a telephone benefits-enrollment system called Marriott Telephone Information and Enrollments, or Martie. Marriott's 100,000 employees can enroll in a health plan or change their choices by using touch-tone phones. But the company's system also lets workers bypass the voice-response system and reach a person at any time during the call, said Maureen Brookbank, vice president for benefits planning at Marriott. **********''It's nice to know that a person is available if I need one, but it's also nice not to have to go through them as a required part of getting the job done,'' said Laura Paugh, 44, vice president for investor relations at  Marriott, who joined the company in 1980, when benefits enrollment was handled on paper by the human resources department. **********Once employees have chosen benefits through Martie, a written confirmation of what they have signed up for is sent to them for their approval. **********Being user-friendly also helps. Employees asked Marriott to simplify the language explaining the new system by substituting phrases like ''the people at Martie'' for ''Martie customer service representatives'' and ''push-button steps'' rather than ''touch-tone telephone instructions.'' **********Maintaining the privacy of the data is also a concern. At Schlumberger, for instance, an automatic password security check is done each time an employee logs on to retrieve personal information. If the check determines that the password can be easily broken, a message appears warning the employee that the code is weak and suggesting that a more secure one be devised. **********Experts acknowledge that the concept of self-service employee benefits is still in its early stages and that managers are still grappling with how to make employees feel at ease with the idea and master the technology. **********And the technology itself is still evolving, said Susan Obijiski, an analyst with the Gartner Group, technology consultants in Stamford, Conn. Many companies do not  have the technology to support self-service systems based on the Web or are relying on the decades-old technology of voice-response systems -- which Mr. Lapointe said could become ''voice-mail jail'' as callers got trapped in a seemingly endless maze of menu choices and button-pressing. **********The companies offering software packages that give workers access to their own records via Web browsers include the Edify Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif., Seeker Software in Oakland, Calif., and Foundation Technologies in Waltham, Mass. **********A survey made public last month by Benefits Access, a benefits administration company in Hartford that is a subsidiary of the Cigna Corporation of Philadelphia, found that 60 percent of 906 benefits managers of companies with 1,000 to 10,000 employees wished that they could provide workers with enough information to make and manage their own benefits decisions. Only 42 percent of the respondents said their employees were fully satisfied with the service they received from their benefits departments. **********Does that suggest that automating the process would improve things? Maybe, maybe not. **********''On-line benefits has a lot of potential, but not if you lose the end user in the process,'' said Ms. Malinak, of Forward Mobility. ''It's important for employers to be able to provide both low-tech and high-tech options for getting employees the information they need to make decisions.'' **********Site-Seeing: Health-Care Information **********Many companies are placing more responsibility in the hands of employees by setting up electronic benefits services to handle things like enrollment choices, address and dependent changes, insurance claims and shifts in investment allocations. Making such choices is no small feat, considering that some large companies let their workers choose from among as many as 150 health maintenance organizations. For consumers who want information that goes beyond what a company or benefits provider may make available during open enrollment, several Web sites are available. Here is a sample. **********HEALTH PAGES: www.thehealthpages.com -- This is an on-line service, based in New York, where you can search a database of more than 500,000 doctors, managed care plans and other health care providers in the United States. The information is based on current data at state health and insurance departments, Federal and state health data organizations, professional licensing boards and provider directories. The site also lets visitors review comments from patients about particular health-care providers. **********NATIONAL COMMISSION ON QUALITY ASSURANCE: www.ncqa.org -- This group, in Washington, tracks quality levels at most major managed care organizations in the United States. It began accrediting managed care organizations in 1991; since then, it has expanded the range of organizations it certifies. Through its Consumer Page, you can find the accreditation status of health plans or download the entire list. The commission also produces Accreditation Summary Reports, which are more detailed decision-making tools for consumers and employers. **********HEALTHFINDER: www.healthfinder.gov -- The Federal Government furnishes information on how to choose quality health care.

''The economy is showing scant signs of slowing. Inflation is clearly moving up.

But it has evolved, primly enough, into the nation's largest manufacturer of stainless steel knives, forks and spoons. **********The original experiment, the Oneida Community, succumbed to the tug of secular forces around it. And now its corporate descendant, Oneida Ltd., is struggling not to fall off the economic tidal wave of the late 20th century: globalization. **********Till now, the global trend has contributed mightily, if sometimes indirectly, to Oneida's success. Competition from third-world countries has trimmed the number of flatware makers with factories in the United States to just one -- Oneida -- from more than two dozen 15 years ago. And globalization has made it easy for the company to open a factory in Mexico and set up agreements with manufacturers in China. It has also led to international alliances like one with CALP S.p.A., an Italian maker of crystal that Oneida sells under its own name. **********But with its imperatives of scale and, consequently, of consolidation, global competition has also made Oneida a prime takeover target. Three months ago, its chief rival, the Libbey Corporation, based in Toledo, Ohio, made a hostile play for the company, causing no small uproar inside the stone fortress, complete with its own ZIP code, that is Oneida's corporate headquarters. **********A marriage of the two medium-sized companies, some analysts say, would let them fight off foreign competitors rather than hurling china at each other. After all, Libbey controls the institutional market in glassware, and Oneida controls the institutional market for silverware. Both now make plates, and Oneida is trying to enter Libbey's glassware business while Libbey is trying to get into Oneida's flatware business. ''It's a phenomenal strategic fit,'' said Arnold Ursaner, a managing director who follows Libbey for CJS Securities in White Plains. **********The problem is that Oneida has wanted none of it. In fact, the company has been so opposed that senior management hasn't even discussed the idea with anyone from Libbey. Every company has a culture, and Oneida's seems deeply rooted in an old-fashioned determination to go its own way. **********Last week, Libbey fattened its offer to $625 million, or $37.50 a share, up from $500 million, or $30 a share. There was no immediate response from Oneida. Its board, which unanimously rejected the first offer, is expected to meet this week to consider the new one. **********Oneida's stubbornness is based on a belief, not unfounded, that it knows what it's doing. ''We've been able to prove to our shareholders that the strategic plan that is in place is the best value for them,'' said Peter D. Kallet, who was appointed chief executive six months ago. The plan calls for steady growth through joint ventures, licensing agreements and other steps to increase sales with relatively low capital investment. **********But there seems to be at least some concern outside the executive suite. Oneida's annual meeting, usually attended by a couple of hundred semi-interested shareholders, was standing room only this year, overflowing with more than 750 people and alive with questions about the Libbey bid and Oneida's future. Mr. Kallet's unequivocal response: The company is not for sale. **********A craving for independence is one legacy the company retains from the Oneida Community. Among the landmarks dotting the sweep of green Oneida property is the Proxy Oak, planted in the mid-1960's after the company held off a takeover bid from a pair of investors and now billowing some 50 feet high. **********''It's in memory of a victory,'' said John D. Raynsford, a soft-spoken print production manager who is descended on his mother's side from the original community. ''We kept the purchasing company off our backs.'' Even after last year, when the company had one of its worst financial performances in recent memory, Mr. Kallet and other executives sound briskly confident that they will be able to hold off any buyers by sticking to their strategy. **********INVESTORS in Oneida's stock have been bounced around over the last year. A year ago, the shares traded at more than $32. In October, the price plummeted to $12.813, and on Friday it closed at $31.0625, thanks in large part to the Libbey offer. **********At Libbey, where the chief executive sounds annoyed that Oneida doesn't even want to discuss a merger, there is a different strategy. The consolidation in the food service and retail industries leaves suppliers -- like Libbey and Oneida -- no choice but to follow the same path, said John F. Meier, Libbey's chairman and chief executive. ''The real competitor of the future is the increasing global competition,'' he said. ''How do we best align ourselves to compete? Five years from now, Libbey isn't going to be losing sleep over Oneida's glassware. It's going to be over glassware from the People's Republic of China.'' **********The Chinese don't seem to worry Oneida management, and maybe that stems from history, too. The Oneida Community, whose products included animal traps and silk thread, adapted well to economic shifts. The company, formed in 1879, branched out into carpet bags, surgical tools and even, during wartime, shell casings and hand grenades. **********''They were always willing to try new ways to make money,'' said Paul E. Gebhardt, a direct descendant of the community's founder, John Humphrey Noyes. ''They were capitalists to their core.'' Mr. Gebhardt designs flatware for Oneida, and his passion for craft items like Russell Wright pottery seems more or less inherited, though he buys them through Ebay, the Web auction site. **********Mr. Meier said he first raised the idea of a merger four years ago, but his chief contact at Oneida, Gary Moreau, then the chief operating officer, wound up resigning. (He is now president of Lionel, the model train company, and serves on the Libbey board.) ''They have simply said 'we're not interested, we prefer to remain independent and we believe in the merits of our own strategic plan, thank you very much,' '' he said. So, taking the matter into his own hands, Mr. Meier has begun meeting with some of Oneida's major shareholders, with what he says are fruitful results. ''They see the wisdom of this offer,'' he said. **********That may not mean they agree. One of the company's five biggest shareholders, the Homestead Funds, listened to Mr. Meier earlier this month. ''We think we understand what he's trying to accomplish,'' said Stuart Teach, the senior equity portfolio manager, who controls about 10 percent of Oneida stock through the funds and a separate pension group.  ''As to whether we appreciate what he's doing toward Oneida, that's another story. Oneida has a very fine story to tell also.'' **********After the offer was raised to $37.50 a share, however, Mr. Teach sounded more interested in Libbey's case. ''Suffice to say, this was a leap forward by the Libbey people,'' he said. Other major shareholders, including Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, would not comment. **********Last year, Oneida went through a series of restructurings and write-downs and closed a factory in Canada, all with the intent of saving about $20 million a year. About 140 additional jobs are to be trimmed this year through early retirements. **********In the first quarter of this year, sales rose 10 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier, while earnings zoomed 25 percent. That is not counting a one-time $18 million loss from restructuring. **********''Their information technology is good, and that's critical to being competitive,'' said John B. Walthausen, an analyst for C. L. King & Associates in New York. ''In some ways, they are old-fashioned. In other ways, I don't think they are.'' **********Oneida has never bothered much with marketing itself to Wall Street. About 17 percent of the stock is owned by its employees, and most of the rest by institutional investors. Mr. Walthausen is the only analyst in the country who covers the company. **********But behind its reserved facade, Oneida aggressively seeks to dominate the table-setting business, starting with stainless flatware. Its luxury patterns are on view at Macy's, and its budget brands appear on airline trays at 35,000 feet. Its china patterns show up on bridal registries, at Disney World buffets and, according to Edward W. Thoma, the company's senior vice president for finance, at the Turning Stone casino, run by the Oneida Nation, just a few miles from company headquarters. **********The company has succeeded by straddling the worlds of consumer goods and institutional products. Its china brands include Noritake and Buffalo China, a widely used restaurant brand. It also makes silver-plated serving pieces for the hotel and restaurant trade at a plant in Shanghai, and recently signed a deal that will have Amway representatives selling its flatware. **********And in a move that no doubt stuck in the Libbey craw, Oneida entered the food service glassware business last year. Using products bought from a Turkish maker, Oneida is urging hotel and restaurant customers to buy glasses as part of its food service package. Libbey sued Oneida earlier this year, maintaining that seven of the glass designs were intentional copies of long-established Libbey styles. The lawsuit, which Oneida says has no basis, is pending. **********''It's going right at the heart of Libbey's core business,'' Mr. Walthausen said of Oneida's latest move. **********THE two companies are roughly the same size. Libbey has a market capitalization of $510 million, compared with $518.8 million for Oneida. Their annual sales equal those figures almost to the dollar. Neither company is big enough, in other words, to throw its weight around in the global economy. **********''Oneida's shareholders are probably being disadvantaged by Oneida management not even being willing to sit down and talk,'' said Mr. Ursaner of CJS Securities. ''The new C.E.O. seems very focused on power and control.'' **********Mr. Kallet says it's not up to him, but to the board. **********''The consumer has confidence when they buy our product,'' he said. ''We have the attitude that the customer is right. And if they lose a spoon, they can get another spoon. We're going to be here.'' **********Mr. Kallet, 52, seems to have been born with an Oneida spoon in his mouth. He joined the company directly out of Syracuse University in 1967 and has worked in practically every area of its business, most recently running the food service division. He took over as chief executive  from William D. Matthews, who had held the job for 12 years and remains chairman, with about 1 percent of the company's stock in his name. **********Mr. Kallet's rise illustrates Oneida's propensity to promote from within. Even the company's outside directors are largely drawn from the immediate vicinity. **********''We're not afraid to bring in new people, if there's a requirement,'' Mr. Kallet said, ticking off three senior management jobs that have been filled by outsiders. ''Over the last six or seven years, we've brought in more non-Oneida-raised people.'' **********If growth is the object, why doesn't Oneida buy Libbey? ''That's been examined and rejected as well,'' Mr. Thoma said. ''If you're going to make an acquisition, you look for one with the least overlap, because that causes redundancies. There isn't a lot of synergy in that one.'' **********Synergy was an idea that worked for the Oneida Community. The daily life of its 300 members revolved around the Mansion House, an angular red-brick complex that today is a kind of community center and senior citizens' residence. The company sold the structure several years ago, though it continues to use some rooms for various functions. **********Members of the Oneida Community called themselves ''Perfectionists'' and believed that God demanded variety in all aspects of life, including sex. Monogamy was considered impure, and older community members were assigned to introduce younger ones to what they considered the holy pleasures of the flesh, according to ''Without Sin,'' a 1993 history of the community by Spencer Klaw. Everything outside the community was called ''the World.'' Children were raised collectively, spending much of their time in a house that was connected to the Mansion House by an underground tunnel. **********The commune officially disbanded in 1881, although former members continued to operate the company for some time. Vestiges of the community are everywhere, from Thanksgiving reunions of Noyes descendants to Oneida's stock symbol, OCQ, which stands for Oneida Community Quality. ''Perfectionism really carried the day for them,'' Mr. Gebhardt said, recalling his ancestors. ''In business, they always felt they could better the competition.'' **********But just as the Oneida Community was ultimately consumed by ''the World,'' the world economy could become an issue for Oneida Ltd. Mr. Meier, Libbey's chief executive, is relentless about achieving strength through unity. ''We are both public companies, and we have an obligation to sustain as best we can long-term shareholder value,'' he said. ''Our offer is still out there.''"

''It appears that consumers have yet to show any inclination of spending less,'' she said. ''Just what that means in terms of Fed policy is not quite clear. After all, we've seen strong consumption and a low inflation environment coexist for years.'' **********But that is not to say that market participants are not concerned, especially since the Fed has already increased short-term interest rates twice this year. **********Investor jitters generally make the market vulnerable to speculation and idle talk. Yesterday there was plenty of talk giving traders the excuses they needed to sell securities. **********Bonds fell after a Government report showed that retail sales in August posted their biggest gain in six months, a strong 1.2 percent, or 0.7 percent excluding auto sales. Even though the numbers were broad-based, traders were a little reluctant to chase prices sharply lower ahead of today's closely watched inflation report, the August Consumer Price Index. Some economists expect a gain of 0.5 percent after a gain of 0.7 percent in July. **********''We heard some talk that insurance companies were sellers of paper in anticipation of huge claims from Hurricane Floyd,'' Ms. Rupert said. ''Also we hear that the Bank of Japan might be in the market buying sizable amounts of notes. There was good buying in the 10-year maturity, tied to the unwinding hedges surrounding Freddie Mac's $6 billion offering priced today.'' **********Freddie Mac, the nation's second largest buyer of home mortgages behind Fannie Mae, priced its global sale of 10-year reference yesterday through underwriters led by Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch and Bear, Stearns. **********The notes yielded 6.729 percent, or about 79.5 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield of a 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for many corporate borrowers, rose to 5.95 percent. **********Renewed weakness in the dollar against the Japanese yen also worsened negative market sentiment. **********The Treasury auctioned $10 billion of 52-week bills yesterday with what analysts called decent results given the rate had increased to 5 percent. **********The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 52-week bill: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures **********Price . . . 94.944 **********High Rate . . . 5.00% **********Coupon Yield . . . 5.28% **********Low Rate . . . 4.98% **********Median Rate . . . 4.90% **********Total applied for . . . $34,215,735 **********Accepted . . . $15,540,235 **********Noncompetitive . . . $901,414 **********The one-year bills mature Sept. 14, 2000."

''Mama said no good could come from a close reading of the Bible.'' **********As a child in a Ukrainian village, Mr. Cherevatov spent Sunday mornings in the local Russian Orthodox Church with his grandmother. Later when he joined the Young Communist League, he had to stop going to church. But as soon as religious freedom dawned in the ruins of the Soviet empire, he began exploring his faith. **********His journey began inside Russian Orthodoxy, but in the end led him out of it -- a trajectory that has been repeated by hundreds of thousands of other Russian Christians, and set off alarms in the Russian Orthodox Church about inroads into their flock made by what its priests call ''totalitarian sects.'' **********''The script is always the same,'' Mr. Cherevatov said. ''I left my church, I betrayed the beliefs of my forefathers, of my country. But nobody ever asks why I left the church. It was not fanaticism that led to this choice, it was common sense. Now I have a comparison to make. '' **********A 1997 law on religion restricted nontraditional denominations, and after that, the Orthodox Church kept pressures on its rivals. Last August, Aleksei II, Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, called for a ban on proselytizing faiths, particularly those that try to lure people away from the ''religions of their ancestors.'' **********The case now before a Moscow civil court, heard in a small courtroom, is being closely watched by religious and human rights groups as the first significant attempt to use the law to restrict worship. Also watching will be Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who raised the case with her Russian hosts during a recent visit, and the United States Senate, which has on its books a law that links American aid to Russia to religious freedom. **********If the judge agrees with the prosecutor, Jehovah's Witnesses -- an aggressively proselytizing community with 130,000 believers in Russia -- could lose their legal status and be banned in Moscow, where 10,000 followers reside. Technically, their national status would not be affected but many fear that such a ruling would only encourage local judges to follow suit, and not only against Jehovah's Witnesses. **********''If they are successful in this case, then it will be terrible,'' said Lyudmila Alekseyeva, president of the International Helsinki Federation, ''because after that, they will feel free to attack other groups.'' **********Mrs. Alekseyeva, long a campaigner for human rights, said that ''in a closed society like Russia, people don't like anything that is not 'ours.' When I ask people what is so dangerous about the Jehovah's Witnesses, nobody can answer, but they are sure they are, anyway. But this is not a theological problem. It is a human rights problem.'' **********The atmosphere at the hearing today in a grimy court building in a neighborhood north of the Kremlin -- where one of two elevators was broken, its doors kept open by a broken chair -- carried faint hints of Soviet times when political and religious dissidents were shuffled from trial to trial. **********Today, more than 100 Jehovah's Witnesses in wool coats and soggy boots gathered silently outside the courtroom doors. Many said they were prepared to wait as long as it takes for the judge to reach a resolution, even weeks. **********''We cherish our truth,'' said Lena Sijanova, 27, who joined the Jehovah's Witnesses with her mother, ''and they are trying to take it away. But you cannot forbid people's right to their faith because that right comes only from God.'' **********According to the complaint filed by a Moscow district prosecutor, the Jehovah's Witnesses have violated the 1997 law by preaching religious discrimination, breaking up families, withholding medical treatment -- all in the name of their ''one true religion.'' After an exhaustive textual analysis of literature disseminated by the Witnesses' door-to-door proselytizers, the prosecutors concluded that ''overseers'' in Russia and abroad ''not only control the spiritual environment of the congregation, but also subject the manner of life, thinking, psyche and conduct of every member of the sect.'' **********''The sect has a strong anti-Government, antisocial and anti-traditional as well as anti-Christian orientation,'' the prosecutors said. More than 21 witnesses are prepared to testify to the damage wrought by  Jehovah's Witnesses on their family life and finances. Written testimony has been provided by a top expert from the Serbski Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry -- notorious in Soviet times for its ''treatment'' of dissidents -- who found that ''the teaching and activity of Jehovah's Witnesses contains factors that may lead to neuroticism and a state of depression.'' **********But the essence of the case is strangely enough theological, presenting the unlikely scenario of a district court judge, born and trained in Soviet state atheism, sorting through arguments about the coming of Armageddon and views of relative religious superiority. **********''It amounts to a theological discussion,'' said Albert Polanksi, the Moscow representative of the community's world headquarters. ''And yet, Jehovah's Witnesses are recognized by the Council of Europe and as Russia is a member, we should be fully protected.''"

The United States and Britain recruit 17-year-old volunteers. The treaty's final draft would now prohibit forced recruitment of children for use in armed conflict'' but allow voluntary enlistment. **********In another compromise, the treaty omits from its list of ''worst forms'' of child labor, work depriving children of education, a goal that some developing countries said was unrealistic. But Mr. Clinton used as a success story a program in Pakistan where the labor organization and the United Nations International Children's Education Fund joined forces to remove children under 14 from soccer ball production and replaced them with women needing the work. The children then were given a chance to attend school, he said. **********As a worst case, Mr. Clinton singled out Myanmar, formerly Burma, where, he said, the labor organization just reported that ''flagrant violation of human rights persists, and I urge the I.L.O. governing body to take definite steps.'' **********In a recent report, the labor organization said 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 worked, mostly in Asia and Africa. **********To reinforce the treaty that is expected to be adopted here and which the White House is urging the Senate to approve, Mr. Clinton issued an executive order last weekend directing Government agencies not to buy  products made by forced child labor.  The order mandates preparation of a list of countries and products that may involve forced labor. All Government agencies must then consult the list before purchasing and contractors must certify child labor is not involved in their products. **********The child labor treaty does not  include sanctions against countries that do not enforce the provisions. Instead, the labor organization makes persistent abuses known. **********--------------------        Clintons Dine With Chiracs **********PARIS, June 16 -- President and Hillary Rodham Clinton dined tonight with the French President, Jacques Chirac, and his wife, Bernadette, at a well-known Paris bistro, Chez L'Ami Louis. **********The dinner was intended as an informal get-together before talks Thursday between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Chirac.

In March, he started doing it himself. **********Using the Internet meant he could place orders on weekends and when his financial consultant, as stockbrokers are known at Merrill Lynch, was out of town. ''It was easier for me to do it and more convenient,'' he said in a recent interview at his office on the 32d floor of the World Financial Center. **********If anyone doubted the shift toward Internet investing, the trend became clear on June 1, when the nation's largest investment house, Merrill Lynch, announced that it was joining the Internet revolution. The firm said it would begin selling stocks on line for $29.95 a trade on Dec. 1, placing it in direct competition with discount firms like the Charles Schwab Corporation, which already offers Internet trading for that price. **********With Merrill Lynch lowering its drawbridge to accept cheap Internet trades, pressure mounts for other full-service brokerage firms to do the same. If they follow Merrill Lynch's lead, it will mean a move away from the tradition of brokers who advise and steer investors to stocks -- in return for a commission -- toward a world where consumers go on line to research, then buy, their own stocks. **********The question for consumers will be figuring out whether Internet trading is right for them and finding the cheapest, most reliable place to do it. The question for Merrill Lynch -- and by extension, the financial services industry -- is how it is going to pay for its gigantic infrastructure of brokers, sales staff and analysts if all the consumer cares about is finding a cheap and mechanically reliable place to trade. **********Already, on-line trading accounts for 37 percent of all retail trades, according to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, an investment firm. That percentage is expected to grow. A recent study by Gomez Advisors, a company that advises E-commerce companies, and Harris Interactive, an Internet market research company, found that 16 million more investors are likely candidates for on-line trading. **********But these rising numbers have been accompanied by costly glitches. One company's stock soared 38,000 percent after on-line investors bought it by mistake, using the wrong ticker symbol, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a May speech before the National Press Club. He also spoke of a woman who tried to buy $18,000 worth of stock but ended up owing more than $250,000 after the stock's price soared and her cancel orders didn't go through. **********Consumers need to be educated to prevent such gaffes, Mr. Levitt said. Investors must understand basics such as how to place a ''limit'' order, setting the maximum price they will pay for a rising stock, he said. And they need to factor in phone lines that can clog and systems that become overwhelmed, causing time lags in placing and canceling orders. **********The National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq stock market, sent notices to member brokerage firms earlier this year with advice on how to educate consumers and on ways to design Internet systems to head off problems. **********But the bottom line is that those who buy on the Internet assume more responsibility for their investing behavior. **********COMMISSIONED stockbrokers were never objective advisers, said David S. Pottruck, president and co-chief executive of Charles Schwab, the discount brokerage firm, which has never used brokers to recommend stocks. They stood to gain financially by pushing stocks and investment products with large commissions, he said. **********But at least stockbrokers were trained on investments and worked under regulations requiring that they recommend only those stocks suitable to the client. Reputable brokers advised the unsophisticated against risky and expensive behavior, like rapid trading in and out of stocks. **********Investors who come up with their own stock picks must determine themselves whether a particular stock fits their financial goals and weigh the tax consequences of a trade. A way to alert buyers when they order a particularly inappropriate stock over the Internet may be developed, Mr. Litan said, but it is unlikely that an Internet brokerage firm would be required to refuse the order. **********The July shootings in Atlanta, where a day trader killed nine people at two brokerage offices after losing more than $100,000 in 15 days of trading, increased public awareness of the dangers of that particular form of investing. But people buying stocks from the comfort of home rather than at a day-trading office can also make big mistakes. **********Bill Bunke, 37, of Manhattan Beach, Calif., said he gave up his pool-maintenance business to trade stocks on line. In 18 months, Mr. Bunke said, he lost $25,000 of a $70,000 inheritance. ''It was only $8 a trade, and by nature I like to gamble and it looked so easy to me,'' he said. ''There were times I bought shares of a stock I'd never heard of before. I really got addicted.'' **********But others have taken a more deliberate approach and done well. Andrew Lohmann, a 36-year-old graduate student in Claremont, Calif., has never bought stocks any way but by using his computer. Since 1995, he has turned the $4,000 he decided he could afford to lose into $50,000 by buying stocks like Schwab and America Online. **********Robert Litan, who buys stocks over the Internet for some of the same reasons more than five million other Americans do, said, ''It's so easy.'' He began investing on line in 1998, four years after investors first bypassed stockbrokers with the click of a mouse. But Mr. Litan is not just another guy in search of cheap Internet brokerage commissions, which average less than $16 a trade, a fraction of what a full-service broker would charge. As director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a research group in Washington, he knows that dangers lurk for naive Internet investors -- not to mention for the nation's 607,000 brokers, many of whom he thinks will soon be forced out of the job. **********Pouring a large chunk of one's savings into individual stocks isn't a good idea for the average investor, Mr. Litan said. Most people would be better off in mutual funds, managed by professionals, he said, rather than trying to decipher the analysts' reports increasingly offered by on-line brokers. **********But the real risk, Mr. Litan said, is to the livelihoods of brokers, who on average earned $168,726 in 1998, according to the Securities Industry Association. Some investors, particularly wealthy ones, will always be willing to pay to be coddled by a hands-on broker, he said. But ''for the mass market, the traditional broker will become irrelevant,'' he predicted. Why pay high commissions for a broker's advice when most of them can't beat the market anyway? he asked. **********Merrill Lynch executives announced their move onto the Internet after traveling to Silicon Valley and Austin, Tex., early this year, where they heard from customers clamoring for on-line investing. At the same time, the company rolled out a second program it hopes will skim off investors who want access to Internet investing but are willing to pay for more personalized service. For a fee starting at $1,500 and increasing with the size of the account, Merrill will provide unlimited trading over the Internet or with a broker, as well as advice on stocks and financial planning tools. That program began July 1. **********Both programs come with checking accounts and debit cards. **********Merrill Lynch says it will continue to offer traditional, commission-based broker trades, with customers paying $35 to $105 in commissions for up to 100 shares, depending on the stock's price. ''Some clients like the traditional relationship,'' said Susan Thomson, a Merrill Lynch spokeswoman. Investors with at least $50,000 to invest can also opt for professional money managers. **********Merrill Lynch executives stress that the change simply means its brokers will focus more on fee-based financial consulting and less on pushing stocks for a commission. **********Full-service brokerage firms have been moving in that direction for years, said Samuel Hayes, professor of finance at the Harvard Business School. Some brokers will continue to act like salesmen, he said, drawing in customers they then direct to the firms' fee-based investment products -- mutual funds, trusts and money managers. **********Merrill Lynch has stressed financial planning in training its brokers over the last decade, Miss Thomson said. Its certified financial management program, begun in 1980, was enhanced last year, she said. **********Whether consumers accustomed to thinking of brokers as salesmen will start seeing them as objective financial consultants remains in question, Mr. Litan said. ''It wouldn't surprise me if the effort fails.'' **********BUT Mr. Steffens -- who got his start at the firm in its broker training program 36 years ago, and whose son, Andrew, is a Merrill Lynch broker in North Carolina -- predicts the ranks of Merrill's 15,000 ''financial consultants'' will grow, not diminish. ''I would like to have 17,000 to 18,000 five years from now,'' he said. **********Still, even Merrill Lynch recognizes its brokers probably will be earning less, at least initially -- up to 18 percent less, by in-house estimates, Miss Thomson said. The firm has agreed to make up the difference for the next two years. **********In a West Coast office, a new Merrill Lynch broker said the firm's shift away from commissioned brokers toward fee-based financial consulting comes as no surprise. In-house, he said, old-style stockbrokers are viewed as dinosaurs. ''And they went belly up and legs up.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/19/business/weapons-makers-seek-rise-in-pentagon-spending.html,Leslie Wayne,1999-05-19,US Government seems inclined to increase outlays for weapons after decade of slashing armaments spending by nearly 70 percent of downsizing military contracting industry; spending will go far beyond request for $12.2 billion in Kosovo emergency fu...,1143,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Weapons Makers Seek Rise in Pentagon Spending,Weapons Makers Seek Rise in Pentagon Spending," **********Whatever lessons the war with Serbia may teach NATO's military planners, American weapons makers are already anticipating that Kosovo may help secure a strategic victory for them -- not on the battlefield, but in Congress. **********After a decade of slashing armaments spending by nearly 70 percent and downsizing the military contracting industry, Washington now seems inclined to increase outlays for weapons. And this spending will go far beyond the request for $12.2 billion in Kosovo emergency funds now before Congress. **********Even before NATO bombs started dropping, the Adminstration's budget proposal in February had requested $112 billion in additional Pentagon spending over the next five years to bring the Pentagon's budget up to $319 billion by 2005. The increase, intended in part to head off Republican contentions that the Democratic White House has let the military atrophy, would be the biggest increase in military spending since the late 1980's. **********For military contractors, the relevant portion of the Pentagon budget is the money earmarked for weapons -- as much as $53 billion for weapons procurement next year and $60 billion the following year -- compared with $44 billion last year, which was the lowest level in more than a decade. Although there was already widespread support for the spending measures, many political and industry analysts say that the fighting in Kosovo can only strengthen the case for increasing weapons spending when Congress takes up the Pentagon budget early this summer. **********''Kosovo has definitely changed things here on defense spending issues,'' said Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who heads the procurement subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, the subcommittee that helps set the level of weapons spending. ''Folks who used to vote to cut defense massively are now voting to deploy our military more and more.'' **********The spending increases would be used to replenish stocks of ships and aircraft, radar jammers and missiles that the Pentagon, for years, contended had become dangerously frayed and dangerously low. Just how many, and what kinds of weapons would be the topic of much further debate and lobbying, even once the money was appropriated. **********But this much is already clear: Most of the transports, weapons and ordnance now in use in Kosovo is equipment no longer actively produced -- including the C-5 transport plane, the B-2 bomber and the Tomahawk cruise missile. So the need for new generations of materiel, and the money to pay for it, represents the best business opportunity in years for military contractors. **********''Kosovo underscores what the industry has been saying -- that we need to get to a sustainable rate of spending,'' said Daniel T. Burnham, chief executive of the Raytheon Company, which made the Tomahawk cruise missile. ''We need to get to $60 billion in weapons outlays,'' Mr. Burhham said. ''We are now on that path. And we are getting there faster than we first thought.'' **********Too fast, perhaps, for some. **********''The procurement amounts proposed are out of line,'' Representative Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat from Hawaii who is ranking member of a House Armed Services personnel subcommittee, said yesterday. ''We haven't answered fundamental questions of what size defense we want, how we get there and what are the costs the country can realistically absorb in a post-cold-war environment.'' **********The downsizing and consolidation that followed the end of the cold war has left the nation with three main military contractors: the Boeing Company, Raytheon and the Lockheed Martin Company, along with thousands and thousands of subcontractors that are attached to these giants. **********Pentagon budgets have long been operated on a boom-and-bust cycle. But during this latest period of industry reorganization, fundamental changes were also taking place in the nature of warfare. No longer was the nation planning for a big two-country conflict of the type once feared with the Soviet Union. **********Instead, the 1990's have been characterized by many small military engagements. Compared with the Bush Administration, when there were 14 military engagements -- most notably the gulf war -- the Clinton years so far have seen American troops called into action nearly four dozen times, including the current engagement in Yugoslavia. Those efforts include military missions in South Korea, Haiti, Somalia, the Balkans and Iraq -- as well as humanitarian efforts following hurricanes and earthquakes in Central America and other places. **********''These engagements wear out equipment faster, and the faster it wears out, the sooner you have to pay for new equipment,'' said Jonathan L. Etherton, head of legislative affairs for the Aerospace Industries Association, a Washington trade group. ''A lot of this equipment will end its useful life faster than expected.'' **********At the same time, in addition to the C-5 and B-2 planes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, many of other weapons now being used in the Balkans have aged and, often, are no longer in production. The Pentagon has not bought new F-16 Fighting Falcons in years, and the F-15 Strike Eagle production line is about to close. The list of aircraft out of production includes the EA-6B, a Navy anti-jamming aircraft; the A-10 Thunderbolt, the A-6 attack air-to-ground craft and the F-117 Stealth fighter. **********While the next generation of weapons is still largely a matter for Congress and the Pentagon to decide -- with intense lobbying from military contractors -- the Pentagon has already drawn up a wish list. It includes additional F-22's, upgrades of the Abrams tanks and Apache helicopter, a new destroyer, attack submarine and a new aircraft carrier. **********And in what already is shaping up as a showdown between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon has proposed a Joint Strike Fighter to replace the F-16, now made by Lockheed. **********One other impact of Kosovo for American military contractors is the realization that NATO might not be as much of a customer for their future products as previously imagined. For years, the military industry has lobbied for NATO expansion -- in fact the Committee to Expand NATO, the main lobbying force, is headed by a Lockheed Martin executive. The assumption has been that all these countries would want to buy all the latest and newest equipment that American arms makers could produce rather than relying on European-made armaments. **********Certainly, Kosovo has highlighted the shortcomings of many of the European forces -- and thus of coalition warfare, when allies are not equally equipped. Only 10 percent of the aircraft used by European forces are capable of precision bombing, and few of the NATO countries have the smart weapons and communications systems now common in the American military. But it is unclear whether other NATO nations will increase their military budgets enough to buy new equipment and, even if they did, whether they would buy from American military contractors rather then European ones. **********''Kosovo is showing the big disparaties in NATO capability,'' said one miltary industry lobbyist, who insisted on not being named. ''That will be looked at after the war. But will these countries have the political imperative to buy this new equipment? The answer is still out.''"

But some of the most intensive talks are going to take place with a skeptical Congress. **********Any agreement that the Administration reaches with China on its entering the World Trade Organization is expected to face strong opposition from a bipartisan coalition of Democrats who are concerned about human rights and protection for American manufacturers and Republicans who are interested in punishing China for allegations of espionage and theft of United States weapons technology. **********The political situation on Capitol Hill remains so tenuous that Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said today that he would advise the Administration not to bring the issue to Congress until more Republicans, including Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, could be turned around. **********Mr. Lott has called membership for China in the trade group ''the wrong decision at the wrong time.'' **********What makes Chinese membership so controversial in Congress is that it would deprive lawmakers of the opportunity they now have every year to voice concerns about Beijing's behavior on an array of issues. **********Now, Congress gets to vote annually on whether China should be accorded normal trading status with the United States. If China enters the World Trade Organization, its trade relations with the United States will be made normal permanently. **********It was the fear that Congress would never approve an agreement in the current climate that led President Clinton 10 days ago to reject a proposed agreement with Zhu Rongji, the Chinese Prime Minister. **********Mr. Clinton abruptly reversed course last week after Mr. Zhu and American business leaders loudly complained, leading to the renewal of talks. **********Administration officials say they now believe that a final deal with China can be negotiated by the end of May, presenting the White House with a difficult decision. **********It could try to turn the annual debate in Congress over trade relations with China into a make or break vote on ratification of the deal. Or it could allow Congress to spill its anger at China in the annual trade vote and then come back later in the fall and try to win China entry to the world trade body. **********A senior White House official said opinion within the Administration was split, with Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, advocating a full-blown debate soon but others including Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, believing that it would be politically costly and perhaps fruitless. **********Senator William Roth, the Finance Committee chairman, who is an Administration ally on China, said today that he would lean toward only one vote. ''My inclination is once is enough,'' the Delaware Republican said. ''It's going to take bipartisan support. I think we'll get it through the Senate, but its not going to be easy.'' **********The House is even less certain, with many Republicans hewing toward a more isolationist course and many Democrats less enamored with free trade and more concerned about human rights issues while looking for ways to protect American manufacturing jobs. **********John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said simply that House approval of an agreement right now ''would be a challenge,'' though Mr. Hastert himself supported Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization as long as it obeyed the institution's rules. **********Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said he was trying to ''think creatively'' about ways that Congress might yet be able to have an annual review of China's behavior. He declined to elaborate. **********''I am for China being in the W.T.O.,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''I think the more you get China involved in living with international rules on trade and having a rule of law in the country, the better it is for everybody. Having said that, it is also important to maintain a way to keep pressure on China to give their people basic human rights.'' **********For now, Administration officials said, they will delay a decision on how to proceed until they have a deal in hand and until they can judge how successful the business community will be in lobbying Congress not to imperil the huge market openings that China has offered in areas ranging from agriculture to telecommunications, banking and insurance. **********Twenty corporate executives from the Business Roundtable are to meet at the White House on Tuesday with John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin before lobbying lawmakers including Mr. Lott. **********But another wild card is labor. ''This is a new ball game,'' said David A. Smith, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s public policy director, noting that the United States already had a $60 billion trade deficit with China. **********''Unless a range of human and labor rights questions are resolved,'' he said, ''and at the moment that seems unlikely, it's unlikely we would find any W.T.O. accession agreement acceptable.''"

The acknowledgment indicates that the cola wars have moved to a fresh international arena. While Pepsi executives had said they would not exploit Coke's problems that arose from a recall in Europe earlier this month, they appeared less constrained over Coke's already difficult relationship with the European Commission. **********''Late last year, we expressed our concern about certain Coca-Cola practices that we believe are unlawful, and this year we filed a formal complaint with the commission,'' a Pepsi spokesman, Richard Detwiler, said yesterday. He would not elaborate on what those practices were. But the European Union's competition commissioner, Karel van Miert, said yesterday that the inquiry centered on whether Coke had used its power as the biggestseller of soft drinks to dissuade retailers from  stocking rival products. **********Mr. van Miert said European regulators suspected Coke had used illegal incentives in Denmark, Austria and Hungary. They included rebates for meeting growth targets and for offering a full range of Coke products, and payments for exclusivity. **********He also said there were ''indications that Coca-Cola is granting very significant promotional rebates in the form of price reductions or free products, which are sold by participating buyers, like supermarkets, during promotions.'' **********A Coca-Cola spokesman denied the accusations, saying, ''We are confident that at the conclusion of this process, the Coca-Cola Company's business practices will be found to be within all laws and regulations.'' **********Earlier this year, Mr. van Miert castigated Coca-Cola executives over plans to acquire most of the overseas rights to Cadbury Schweppes brands, accusing the soft-drink giant of trying to sidestep European Union antitrust rules. Coke maintains that it and the European officials interpreted the requirements differently. **********Investigators from Mr. van Miert's office swooped into Coke offices in Austria, Hungary and Denmark early Monday and Tuesday, seizing documents from company files. They also seized papers from company offices in London. **********At a meeting with analysts in New York yesterday, Coke's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, played down what had happened.  ''It's a pretty routine thing,'' he said. ''It happens. It's not the first time. It's been happening in other industries.'' He added: ''I sort of expected it, that as this wave was going through, someone in the E.U. would say, 'Oops, we forgot Coca-Cola.' ''"

Medical supplies are scarce, and running water is unavailable in most of the affected area. **********The exact number of victims -- dead, injured and missing -- is impossible to determine with precision in the chaos of a city and country unprepared for such destruction. **********The official crisis center announced tonight that more than 10,000 bodies had been recovered so far, and that the number of injured had risen to 34,000. Those still alive among the many, many thousands missing are at grave risk if they are not found and freed soon. **********Struggling to gain control over the disorder, and under heavy criticism both for the extent of the damage to poorly constructed buildings and the Government's disjointed response, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ordered that the dead be buried as soon as they are found. He said the bodies should be photographed so relatives could identify them later. **********''Perhaps the greatest problem now facing us is that of epidemic,'' Mr. Ecevit, dressed in black, said today. He described the earthquake as ''one of the worst in human history and the heaviest in Turkish history.'' **********Government officials, relief agencies, journalists and others were left to try to divine the overall human cost from outward signs, like an aerial survey of Istanbul that produced a rough estimate of the populations of the demolished areas. **********But after estimates that have spoken of many thousands injured, the predictions today jumped an order of magnitude to tens of thousands. Government officials have asked the United Nations for 10,000 body bags.  And a United Nations official said the final death toll could reach 40,000. **********''An estimated 35,000 people  are under the rubble,'' the official, Sergio Piazzi, told reporters in Geneva. ''This is from the Turkish authorities.'' **********''Practically one-third of the Turkish population lived in the area affected by the earthquake,'' Mr. Piazzi said. ''I can only add that in the Golcuk area alone, 10,000 people are expected to be under the rubble.'' **********Mr. Piazzi, who heads the European desk of the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said that some of those buried could survive until Monday or Tuesday, but that he feared most are beyond hope. Asked if the death toll could reach 40,000, he replied, ''It is a possibility.'' **********In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was among the hardest hit, city officials issued an urgent appeal for portable toilets as a way of lessening the risk of disease as hordes of residents continued to camp outdoors. **********Relief workers there and in other towns said that they had treated cases of dysentery, diarrhea and gastroenteritis, but that there had been no reports of cholera, a far more serious disease that sometimes breaks out under these circumstances. **********''What is important now is that the bodies be recovered from underneath the ruins so that microbes from the corpses do not spread,'' said Senol Ergunsay, a doctor in Golcuk. **********In fact, according to a statement today by the World Health Organization, while unsanitary conditions can spawn disease, the bodies of the earthquake victims themselves do not present a significant health hazard. **********Still, Muslim clerics have ruled that under the current extreme circumstances, Islamic burial customs need not be followed. They said that bodies could be buried in a single shroud instead of three and that the bodies could be washed with sand if no water is available. They also said  that men and women could be buried together. **********The more than 2,000 foreign relief specialists who have arrived here since Tuesday continued to take the lead in rescue operations, and public anger toward the Government remained intense. Newspapers carried banner headlines like ''Total Fiasco'' and ''We Died Twice.'' **********Many people in the earthquake zone said they had still not seen any Turkish relief workers. They are relying on untrained volunteers and hoping that foreigners will show up to direct them. **********''The rescue operation has been very slow, I must admit,'' Sukru Gurel, a Cabinet minister who is helping to coordinate the effort, said at a news briefing. ''But in that region, we are talking about tens of thousands of buildings wrecked. To move quickly, we need tens of thousands of rescue teams, which no government in the world can mobilize.'' **********Asked how high he thought the death toll might reach, Mr. Gurel replied: ''We are afraid it could be beyond our initial estimates. The magnitude of this tragedy is beyond imagination, because such an event only happens once every 200 or 300 years.'' **********According to historians, major quakes have shaken Istanbul more frequently than that. Their accounts say that in the last 5,000 years, there has been such a quake about once every 175 years. Istanbul is now home to 12 million people. **********''The area where this recent quake was centered will not be hit again any time soon, because the seismic pressure there has dissipated,'' said Ahmet Cakmak, a professor of engineering at Princeton University who is an expert on Turkish seismology.  ''But the fault that runs closer to Istanbul is still very dangerous, and a major quake here is very likely. '' **********He added: ''There's plenty of time to prepare for that quake, but usually the memory of devastation lasts five years at most, and then people go back to building and living as they did before. The newspapers are saying we survived the big earthquake, but that's silly. It's a big mistake.  What we should do is learn from this one, expect a bigger one and be prepared.'' **********In the 400-mile stretch of the earthquake zone, tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed. Counts of the injured and dead began to be made available by towns. In Izmit, one of the hardest hit, 3,242 people were dead and 8,759 injured; in Adapazari, 2,995 were dead and 5,081 injured. In the town of Yalova, 1,442 died and 4,300 were hurt. **********Here in Istanbul, 984 were dead, and 9,541 injured. **********More victims were rescued today, most of them by foreign relief teams. An American team was using a flexible fiber optic video cable capable of snaking through spaces too small even for a finger, and ultra-sensitive audio devices to pick up faint noises. **********Israeli soldiers working in the village of Cinarcik, where several Israeli tourists are missing, pulled an 11-year-old Turkish girl from the rubble after working for 17 hours to reach her. **********''It was surprising that she managed to survive,'' said an Israeli doctor who worked alongside the soldiers. ''During the long hours while we rescued her, we managed to teach her a few words in Hebrew, and we built a lot of trust.''"

https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/02/business/in-wall-st-computer-test-new-year-arrives-in-march.html,Barnaby Feder,1999-03-02,"On March 6, about 400 brokerage firms, banks, exchanges and other institutions will push clocks on their computers forward to Dec 29 as first stage in full-scale test of their readiness to trade stocks, bonds and other securities in Year 2000 (M)",764,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"In Wall St. Computer Test, New Year Arrives in March","In Wall St. Computer Test, New Year Arrives in March"," **********Wall Street is going back to the future. On Saturday, about 400 brokerage firms, banks, exchanges and other institutions will push the clocks on their computers forward to Dec. 29 as the first stage in a full-scale  test of their readiness to trade stocks, bonds and other securities in the Year 2000. **********Just as in July, when a core group of 28 Wall Street firms performed a trial run, the meticulously scripted tests will cover the first trades to settle in the new year, including options that expire Jan. 22. Because the $270 billion securities industry has been a pacesetter in dealing with potential Year 2000 computer problems and the July experiment went well, any major disruptions found in the tests would puncture recent optimism that banks, utilities and other critical parts of the business infrastructure can make the transition to next year without significant breakdowns. **********The Year 2000 problem stems from the longtime practice of programming dates in computers with two digits for the year, like 99 for 1999. Some computers and software interpret 00 as 1900 instead of 2000 and others cannot interpret 00 at all, leading to crashes or faulty data. **********Securities companies began dealing with such problems sooner than most, partly because the need to handle long-term loans and bonds had alerted them to the hazards of two-digit coding. Domestic securities firms will end up spending $5 billion to correct the problems, according to the Securities Industry Association, which has been coordinating correction and testing efforts since 1996. **********The new round of tests will cost the association about $10 million and the participants as much as $100 million, according to Donald Kittell, executive vice president of the association. About 5,000 people will be involved. **********''This is a dress rehearsal for the real event,'' Mr. Kittell said. ''We expect to come through with flying colors.'' **********Besides involving many more brokers and much higher volumes than the trial run in July, the new tests will add about 30 large and small pension fund managers and other institutional investors into the mix. **********''They are representing thousands of buy-side institutions, and we have worked hard to get a representative sample,'' said John Panchery, the association's Year 2000 project manager. **********Another difference with July -- and the reason the tests will run only on Saturdays from March 6 through April 24 -- is that many participants will be using the computers they rely on for daily operations, not the separate systems set up especially for testing that were used in the trial run. **********The tests will start with mock trades that would be made on Dec. 29, 1999, and settled on Jan. 3, the first business day in the year 2000. On March 13, the test scripts will switch to Dec. 30 and the following Saturday to Dec. 31. The most crucial day in the test, Jan. 3, 2000, will be tested on April 10. **********The testing cycles will end on the following two Saturdays with a simulation of Jan. 4, 2000, a date that mutual funds need to completely exercise their processing systems, and a simulation of Jan. 22, 2000, the first date in the new year when options will expire. **********Experts say the industry could still run into problems even if the tests go flawlessly. To start with, there are many other potentially disruptive dates, especially Feb. 29, 2000, a leap day that many programs do not recognize. **********''The most important thing was to test an entire trading cycle over several days,'' Mr. Panchery said. Collectively testing individual days like Feb. 29 would be too expensive and complicated, he said. **********Still, the securities industry is setting a group testing standard that most others cannot hope to duplicate. Electric companies, for example, are planning a major test in April that will simulate various disruptions so that companies can see how well prepared they are to cope with them in a coordinated fashion, but they will not touch the systems that are actually generating power and controlling the grid. **********''There is no way to run a test of multiple utilities of any size and still have enough backup facilities to serve customers if something trips up,'' said Eugene F. Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the National Energy Reliability Council. **********Instead, the power industry is relying on tests by individual utilities of their power plants and control systems and on small joint tests, such as an effort later this month involving Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey; the organizations that control distribution of power in New York and the mid-Atlantic states, along wth AT&T and Bell Atlantic, which are the key suppliers of vital communications links to the utilties."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/23/business/of-fraud-millions-and-one-who-got-away.html,Joseph Kahn,1999-06-23,"Federal authorities have issued arrest warrant for Martin R Frankel, who has fled country with at least $334.6 million in life insurance premiums from as many as 11 insurance companies in five states; Frankel has not been charged with any crime; a...",1555,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"Of Fraud, Millions and One Who Got Away","Of Fraud, Millions and One Who Got Away"," **********In early March, a Mississippi regulator stumbled upon a curious statistic: Several insurers in the state were part of a group of companies that had funneled as much as $14 billion in stock trades through a Connecticut-based securities firm, paying just $40,000 in commissions. **********Even in the age of discount brokers, it seemed too much of a bargain to be true. It was. As they pushed the companies to explain the transactions and show that they were real, Mississippi officials brought down what appears to have been a house of cards, unearthing what investigators now suspect is one of the biggest insurance frauds in recent years. **********Within a few weeks, Martin R. Frankel, the man whose brokerage firm claimed to have made those trades, had fled with hundreds of millions of dollars that investigators said he siphoned from as many as 11 insurance companies in five states. **********Federal authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Frankel, though he has not been charged with any crime. They suspect that his firm, Liberty National Securities, was the foundation of a pyramid scheme. Mr. Frankel, they said, escaped just before it collapsed, slipping out of the United States in early May. He left behind a trail of intrigue that extends from small Southern insurance companies and the ''back country'' luxury of Greenwich, Conn., to the Caribbean and the Vatican. **********The full scale of the scheme is a mystery, as are many details of Mr. Frankel's life. A native of Toledo, Ohio, operating amid elaborate security and under at least three aliases, Mr. Frankel, who is 44, absconded with at least $334.6 million in life insurance premiums from companies in Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Virginia and Missouri, Federal prosecutors said in a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut late last month. **********The scheme may have involved larger sums -- unless accounting records filed by Mr. Frankel were faked. A civil lawsuit filed by the insurers says that $950 million is missing, though some of that may reflect exaggerated trading profits. **********And nearly $2 billion appears to be missing from a charity controlled by Mr. Frankel and affiliated with a Vatican-linked foundation, though some investigators question whether those assets ever existed. **********Though nearly everyone involved in the matter expresses confusion as to exactly what happened, Mr. Frankel, cloaked with credibility provided by the Roman Catholic Church and several prominent political, legal and media figures with whom he associated himself, defrauded insurance companies that he controlled, Federal investigators said, on the assumption that he could move faster than the state regulators who police them. **********''This is all like Alice in the Looking Glass, but we think it's all part of his pyramid scheme,'' said John Q. Kelly, a lawyer who represents a Catholic priest associated with Mr. Frankel. ''He kept a stranglehold on the money, and everyone else involved with him just saw a piece of it.'' **********It took regulators years to catch on. The red flags included Mr. Frankel's tiny commissions, together with what appeared to be huge daily trades of Treasury securities, a practice considered unusual for insurers. **********But the authorities apparently did not discover until too late that Mr. Frankel had been banned from the securities business by the Securities and Exchange Commission for earlier conflicts with investors in Ohio. His quickness in ferrying money to Swiss and other foreign bank accounts when he came under scrutiny also escaped notice. **********Though Federal investigators say that he often used aliases including David Rosse, Mike King and Eric Stevens, Martin R. Frankel was well known to some regulators. The S.E.C. first brought civil fraud charges against him in 1991, contending that he had ''engaged in a fraudulent scheme'' in the sale of limited partnership interests in an entity called the Frankel Fund. **********According to the commission, Mr. Frankel lied about the fund's past performance, his own experience, the identities of the fund's managers and how the proceeds would be used. More than $1 million was raised from investors. In 1992, Mr. Frankel settled the complaint by agreeing to be barred from associating with registered broker-dealers. He promptly violated that agreement by setting up a new trading shop from his home in Greenwich. **********Mr. Frankel surrounded himself with friends who gave him the air of legitimacy. The Rev. Peter Jacobs, a retired priest now living in Rome who has broad connections in American political and religious circles, worked closely with Mr. Frankel to establish a charity, the Saint Francis of Assisi Foundation. Though a business plan for the charity promised to shower more than $1 billion on poor people worldwide, it seems to have been used as a vehicle through which Mr. Frankel sought to buy insurance companies. **********When the time came for the charity to hire a law firm, Mr. Frankel approached Robert S. Strauss, the Democratic Party heavyweight and former ambassador to the Soviet Union, and retained his firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. Akin, Gump said it did minimal work for the charity and no longer has any connection to it. **********The charity also claimed Walter Cronkite, the former CBS news anchor, and Lee Iacocca, the former chairman of Chrysler, as board members. Mr. Cronkite and Mr. Iacocca said they had nothing to do with the charity. **********Mr. Frankel's troubles became evident on May 5. Firemen responding to an alarm at his $3 million home in Greenwich found blazing documents spilling out of fireplaces and a file cabinet smoldering in the kitchen. The house was deserted. **********Mr. Frankel, the authorities now suspect, had already fled the country. Clues were found amid the charred remains of documents in his house. The authorities found a ''to do'' list. Item No. 1: ''Launder Money.'' **********Mr. Frankel also apparently drew up astrological tables to answer questions including ''Will I go to prison?'' and ''Should I leave?'' The authorities found research on United States extradition treaties with various countries, including Israel and Brazil. **********The home of Mr. Frankel and the offices of Liberty National shared an elegant stone contemporary on exclusive Lake Avenue that had been converted with rough drywall partitions into a trading floor with links to the New York Stock Exchange and commodities markets. **********Mr. Frankel often wore jeans and T-shirts, acording to people who visited his home, and operated his business single-handedly, though he had a small staff of young women doing clerical work. **********Apparently obsessed with security, Mr. Frankel, several people who knew him said, traveled with multiple security guards when he ventured outside, which was rarely. The house was protected by a guardhouse, security cameras and floodlights. It contained a network of more than 80 computers connected to satellite receivers. **********Mr. Frankel bought at least one other home in Greenwich and created a stir by using residences with rarefied Lake Avenue addresses to conduct business amid maximum security. Though several neighbors had used the same access road to get to their homes, Mr. Frankel installed a guardhouse and other security measures at the front entry. **********Neighbors ''literally had to pass through a gantlet of security to get to and from their homes,'' said Philip Russell, a lawyer who a few months ago was consulted by several of Mr. Frankel's neighbors to learn their legal options. ''It is not exactly the kind of neighbor who you go over to borrow a pound of sugar from.'' **********Making it worse for the neighborhood was the activity at Mr. Frankel's house. Huge satellite dishes were placed in both the front and back yards, along with floodlights. Residents grew dismayed at the bustling traffic, with as many as 35 people at the home at every hour of the day and night. **********''People were coming and going 24 hours a day, and it was clear there was intensive commercial activity going on,'' Mr. Russell said. **********Court records filed by Federal prosecutors detail a vast web of bogus companies and identities that they believe Mr. Frankel used to perpetuate the fraud. At the center is Sundew International, an entity incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Sundew owned the Greenwich home and had a contract to pay Mr. Frankel $700,000 a year, court records show. **********According to the court records, the fraud worked this way: Mr. Frankel operated or had ties to several corporations, funds and enterprises that bought controlling stakes in insurance companies. **********Over time, these companies steered trading business to his brokerage company, Liberty National, allowing Mr. Frankel to drain their assets. Mr. Frankel used a complicated web of transactions to conceal the destination of funds, according to court records. For example, one insurer in his orbit invested $30 million in an account at Prudential Securities, the New York brokerage house. Mr. Frankel then transferred the money to another account in the name of Bloomfield Investments, which he controlled from his Connecticut mansion. **********That cash was subsequently wired to United Bank of Switzerland, through its branch in Stamford, Conn., and later to account number 70026 at Banque SCS Alliance in Switzerland, court records show. Investigators have determined that money from that account has been used to pay people who worked for Mr. Frankel, as well as to pay vendors and other expenses. **********Regulators in the five states have now seized the insurance companies. Federal grand juries in Bridgeport, Conn., and Nashville are hearing evidence in the case. The Federal Government has moved to seize at least $13.8 million held in 14 separate accounts at banks including Citibank, PNC Bank and Bank of New York. **********Mr. Frankel's whereabouts is unknown."

That role, the advisory group insists, needs to be strengthened. The vast majority of the proposed funds would go to universities, not private industry. **********Federal investment in most areas of information-technology research has been flat or declining for nearly a decade, adjusted for inflation, largely because of the push to curb Government spending in general and because the end of the cold war brought a contraction in military-related research. Yet the erosion in financing has come as the nation's economy has become increasingly dependent on this sector. **********''This is mainly an investment in the key asset of the information age -- trained people nurtured at universities,'' said Bill Joy, a founder of Sun Microrosystems and co-chairman of the advisory committee. ''It's a societal investment. What we need to create is a Silicon Continent, not just Silicon Valley.'' **********The businesses that produce computers, semiconductors, software and communications equipment have accounted for one-third of the growth in production of the American economy since 1992 and have created millions of jobs. But while the industry is flourishing, companies are under more and more competitive pressure to shorten their horizons, as product generations often last a year or less and long-range research is given short shrift. **********''Information technology is a field where the United States leads the world, and it's important to understand how that happened,'' said Larry Smarr, the director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who is a member of the advisory group. ''What we have today can be traced to federally funded long-term research in universities.'' **********There is already some evidence that the White House and Federal agencies may be receptive to the appeal by the panel, the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. In the aftermath of the group's interim report, issued last August, the Clinton Administration proposed in January an increase of $366 million, or 28 percent, in federally financed research for information technology in fiscal year 2000, which begins in September. **********Vice President Al Gore said today that he strongly supported the group's conclusion that ''the Government needs to increase its investment in long-term information-technology research.'' **********Over all, the advisory committee recommends that annual Federal financing for information-technology research increase by $1.3 billion during the next five years. **********The advisory group concluded that the Government-backed research should focus on four areas: software, building up the Internet infrastructure, high-end computing and the impact on society and the work force of information technology. **********Software research, the group's report says, should be directed increasingly at designing software that can be used as smaller, reliable and re-usable building blocks -- ''component-based software design.'' The report warns that the nation has become ''dangerously dependent on large software systems, whose behavior is not well understood and which often fail in unpredicted ways.'' It cites as examples the big-system headaches of some Government agencies, like the Federal Aviation Administration, and the difficulty of fixing the Year 2000 problem in major computer systems. **********The infrastructure research, the report says, is needed to make the move to an increasingly wired world in which today's 30 million computers connected to the Internet could become billions of devices from hand-held computers to household appliances, all linked to the Internet. **********The report calls for increased spending to accelerate the performance of supercomputers that can be used for sophisticated applications like weather and climate forecasting, advanced manufacturing design and development of new drugs. **********The group also recommends the creation of a series of well-financed ''virtual centers'' nationwide. In the report, these centers are termed ''expeditions into the 21st century'' or ''time machines.'' Equipped with the most advanced computers -- hundreds or a thousand times more powerful than today's desktop machines -- the centers would allow computer scientists and others to  experiment with the technology that will become affordable and widespread a decade later. **********In an unusual recommendation from a technology elite, the group also called for social science research on the impact of technology. These include the issues of access to technology, upgrading of workers' skills and encouraging increased participation in the computer sciences by women and minorities. **********''This technology is becoming so important to people's lives and their economic opportunities that as a nation we have to make sure that everything is done so that everyone is connected,'' said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of I.B.M.'s Internet division and a member of the Presidential commission."

The ''5'' button serves as a visual midpoint. For example, the tent-shaped letter ''A'' is formed by pressing 7, then 9. **********Thumbscript was the idea of the psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Smith, who is also an amateur engineer and wanted to design a keyboard that could be operated with one hand. ''I wanted to be able to write things down discreetly during sessions,'' Dr. Smith said. **********The idea for Thumbscript came to him one morning while he was, significantly, on the couch. ''It occurred to me that you could look at the keypad as a picture rather than as a series of numbers,'' he said. **********Dr. Smith took his idea to Smart Design, which tested the method and developed a prototype input device. ''The question was, why would anyone want to learn Thumbscript,'' said Smart Design's chief executive officer, Davin Stowell.  ''The answer is the need for discreet communications. If you're in a location where you don't want to speak on your cell phone -- for that level of functionality, currently, you'd currently need two or three devices.'' **********The company is in negotiations with hardware manufacturers to provide Thumbscript on keypad devices. A version for the Palm Pilot is available at www.thumbscript.com. **********Dr. Smith said users could enter 15 to 20 words per minute using their thumb and 18 to 20 words per minute using a stylus on the Palm Pilot, perfect for phrases like, ''Your hour is up -- we will have to discuss that at your next session.''

https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/08/business/personal-business-work-hard-you-might-win-a-prize.html,Liz Garrigan,1999-08-08,"Article on creative things that smaller companies, in tight labor market, are doing to attract, retain and motiviate loyal employees; meeting of executives of Inc magazine's 1998 list of 500 fastest-growing companies described unusual benefits suc...",745,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Work Hard. You Might Win a Prize.,PERSONAL BUSINESS; Work Hard. You Might Win a Prize.," **********IN the tightest labor market in decades, entrepreneurs are finding that keeping their best workers happy -- and loyal -- is one of their most compelling missions. **********And in going beyond the usual thank-you notes and bonuses, creative cosseting counts. At Assigned Counsel Inc., a kind of temporary-employment service for lawyers, executives have arranged lawn care for an employee for bringing in a large account, and treated others and their spouses to dinner for working especially hard. **********The firm, based in Wayne, Pa., will even set up home offices for the lawyers it places, ''as long as they're responsive to the client,'' said Samuel A. Frederick, a principal at the agency. **********Mr. Frederick and other executives at Assigned Counsel, which made Inc. magazine's 1998 list of the 500 fastest-growing companies in America, met with their peers recently in Nashville for the magazine's annual gathering of the winners. While the group tackled more than a few heady topics during the three-day event, the most pressing issue for the entrepreneurs -- whose companies, on average, are just eight years old -- was simple: keeping good employees and hiring others like them. **********In other words, it was ideas like the free lawn care that really got their attention, not the more predictable ones like private equity finance, taking a company public and other ways to advance their fortunes. ''Everybody kind of has that aspect down,'' said William R. Botti, founder of Computer Networks, a systems integration company in Pleasanton, Calif.; that, after all, is why they were invited to the gathering in the first place. **********''The problems we have in finding, motivating and keeping quality people is an overall theme that everybody's talking about,'' Mr. Botti said. **********Some of the more flamboyant gestures by small businesses to keep their employees have made headlines. For example, Arcnet, a Holmdel, N.J., company that designs and builds wireless communications systems, recently gave leased BMW's, with fully paid insurance, to all of its workers who had been on the job at least a year. That meant 28 of its 57 employees, ranging from administrative assistants to architects. Like other companies, Arcnet has found that rewards, large and small, prove much cheaper than new rounds of recruiting and training. **********At an Inc. roundtable on employee retention, several people talked with frustration about how offering stock to employees made their companies run like committees -- and made them feel that their influence had been diluted. Then Gary L. Quick, founder and chief executive of Quick Solutions, a computer consulting company in Columbus, Ohio, raised his hand. What he said made almost everyone in the room -- including Mr. Botti and his wife and partner, Janet M. Botti -- wonder why they hadn't thought of the same thing. **********Mr. Quick explained that after an employee has been aboard for three years, the company pays to have the employee's house cleaned once a month. It is an investment that costs $60 to $120 a month, depending on the size of the house, but the payoff is much more valuable, Mr. Quick told his colleagues. **********''We were all just sitting there going, 'Great idea,' '' Mr. Botti said. **********Mr. Quick was an executive recruiter for 18 years before starting his own consulting business. If those years taught him anything, he said, it was that ''the warm and fuzzy things really work with employees.'' Pasta baskets for new employees and cookies on birthdays -- all sent to employees' homes -- go further than cash, he said. **********''This goes to the home, this goes to the spouse, and the way I look at it, you get more bang for your buck,'' Mr. Quick said. **********GIVING employees a $1,200-a-year vacation allowance, too, can inspire loyalty in a way that a cash bonus can't, he said. Originally, he said, he thought of offering an annual cruise to employees with at least three years at the company -- there are about 60 of them among its 250 consultants. ''Then some of the people started asking when we announced it if they don't want to do the cruise, can we do something else?'' he said. **********The cruise idea evolved into a flat $1,200 vacation allowance. ''The only restriction we make,'' he said, ''is you have to use it in one shot.'' **********An employee, Mr. Quick said, is more likely to remember ''an elk-hunting trip in Alaska'' than some money in his pocket. **********''Everyone's after our employees, so we want to make it real difficult to lose them,'' he said. ''We take turnover personally.''"

Schieffelin took her case against Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She chose to stay with the firm as a senior saleswoman as a way of ''trying to reform the institution,'' her lawyer told a reporter last week. **********What makes Ms. Schieffelin so unusual is not her belief that Wall Street is a hard place for women to succeed. Whatever the merits of her individual case, debate about discrimination at various brokerage firms focuses on degree, not whether it exists. But what is extremely rare is Ms. Schieffelin's decision to stay and fight when most women who think they are encountering the glass ceiling simply quit. **********''From a practical point of view, when I began litigation with the firm, I was more or less perceived as a pariah in the industry,'' said Ann B. Hopkins, whose sex-discrimination case against Price Waterhouse, one of the major accounting firms, was ultimately heard by the Supreme Court in 1989. Criticized for being ''macho'' and in need of ''a course at charm school,'' Ms. Hopkins prevailed in her quest to become partner, the equivalent of managing director at a Wall Street firm. She rejoined Price Waterhouse in 1991. **********Most women would rather go quietly. Catalyst, a nonprofit group in New York that studies women in the workplace, has conducted more than 500 exit interviews of women managers who left more than 20 companies in the 1990's. While the vast majority of the women contended that they were leaving to spend more time with their families, only 15 percent were still at home six months after they left. **********So why did they leave? Nearly three-quarters of these women told Catalyst that they were greatly influenced by their belief that there was a lack of opportunity for advancement. **********Some companies are slowly recognizing the problem. Deloitte & Touche, for example, created a committee of senior partners in 1992 to investigate why so many women were leaving. After interviewing women who had quit and those who still worked there, the firm's partners discovered that many women believed that Deloitte was not flexible enough for them to successfully balance work with the rest of their lives and were concerned about their chances to move up. Having made a push to address these issues, offering flexible schedules and trying to be more inclusive, Deloitte has closed the turnover gap between men and women. The percentage of women who leave each year has dropped from 29 percent in 1991 to 18 percent. **********''The war for talent is not a myth,'' said Sheila Wellington, the president of Catalyst. ''There is a great deal of concern for retention.'' **********But many women hesitate to speak up because they are not sure that they are being discriminated against. Promotions, especially at the top firms, are not guaranteed, after all, and some figure that the powers that be passed them over because they did not recognize their talent. **********One female investment professional, who spoke only on condition that she not be identified, said that she believed she was denied a promotion in part because she was a woman but decided not to bother wasting time trying to figure it out. Instead, she simply joined another firm. **********''Why spend 10 or 15 years hitting the glass ceiling?'' agreed Janet Tiebout Hanson, who spent 14 years at Goldman, Sachs before founding her own investment firm, Milestone Capital Management. ''Why not go directly to Go and collect $200?'' **********In Ms. Hanson's case, she believes the decision to take three years off for her children derailed her career. ''You can't leave and have children and come back,'' she said. When she returned to the firm in 1991, technology had transformed her business, leaving her too far behind to catch up. She quit to start Milestone, an institutional money-management firm in New York. **********Few women would ever want to bring a lawsuit, even if they believed that they had the grounds. Others question whether progress is best made by bringing a lawsuit. They say that litigation makes life even more difficult for women by making the workplace even less friendly. ''It was hard enough to be part of the inner sanctum,'' Ms. Hanson said. ''I think it is going to be much, much harder'' if women turn increasingly to the courts for relief. **********But what motivates someone to bring a lawsuit is not always easily explained. Ms. Hopkins, for one, is quick to admit that she was not acting ''rationally and analytically'' when she waged her long battle against Price Waterhouse. In the preface to her book, ''So Ordered: Making Partner the Hard Way,'' published in 1996 by the University of Massachusetts Press, she describes herself as being characterized as ''victim, villain, heroine, pioneer, zealot'' and says that she is ''none of these.'' **********''I'm a value-driven person,'' she said, describing a value system that places a priority on bringing about change, when needed. While returning to the firm was not easy, she said that she was not without allies. ''The people who didn't like me still didn't like me,'' she said. ''The people who liked me still liked me.'' **********Ms. Hopkins describes herself as ''very comfortable'' in her current environment. In the Arlington, Va., office where she works as a consultant, she said that there are enough senior women to make her environment a good one in which to work. And people have come to expect her to lobby on behalf of those who may be underrepresented. ''I'm a pro-active outspoken advocate'' for the minority, she said. **********She also counsels patience for anyone, like her, trying to seek change. In 1983, the number of women who were partners in the United States at Price Waterhouse was about 1 percent, she said. When she came back to the firm, it was about 5 percent. Today, about 10 percent of the partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers, the successor firm, are women. Maybe in another 15 years, she said, there will be enough women to make the issue of gender moot. **********Ms. Hopkins said that it never occurred to her to give up on Price Waterhouse and move on to something else. The moment the courts cleared the way for her to return to the job she loved, she turned in her notice at the World Bank. And has the firm changed for the better? One can't help but note that Ms. Hopkins' daughter, Tela, joined PricewaterhouseCoopers last September after graduating from college. ''I think it's a good profession,'' is all her mother  would say."

Today it placed a sizable order of its own, asking Bechtel, the engineering and construction giant, to build distribution and delivery centers in 26 markets. **********And even as Internet deals go, the price tag was impressive: $1 billion. **********Webvan, a privately held company based in Foster City, Calif., is the brainchild of Louis Borders, co-founder of the Borders bookstore chain. Though it trails on-line grocers like Peapod Inc. of Skokie, Ill., and Homegrocer.com Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., in coming to market, it has aggressive expansion plans. **********It operates a 330,000-square-foot distribution center in Oakland, Calif., serving the  Bay Area, and says it will begin operations in Atlanta early next year. **********''Infrastructure is everything,'' said David Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ''To do on-line sales the right way rather than the rush-to-market way they need to develop a very complex distribution system.'' **********In groceries, profit margins ''are so tight you need to figure out where the leverage is,'' Mr. Cooperstein said, adding that Webvan had determined that the leverage was in distribution. **********Analysts say on-line grocery shopping is a tough market to crack because customers expect high quality and are unwilling to pay extra for the convenience. Grocery stores already operate on razor-thin profit margins without the added expense of delivery, and the perishable nature of many foods does not make operating from a central location feasible. By some estimates, an on-line grocer must do 10 times the volume of a typical store to be successful. **********Yet William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, has said on-line grocery shopping could account for a third of United States food sales by 2005. But Jupiter Communications estimates that the on-line grocery market will grow from $350 million in 1999, to $3.5 billion in 2002. That would make groceries one of the largest on-line commerce categories but still less than 1 percent of the total grocery market in the United States. **********Today just one-tenth of a percent of groceries and health-and-beauty items are bought on line in the United States, compared with 4 percent of airline tickets and books and 9 percent of software, according to Jupiter. **********Since its founding last year, Webvan has raised $100 million of venture capital from Knight Ridder, CBS, the Softbank Corporation of Japan and two of Silicon Valley's leading venture-capital firms, Benchmark Capital and Sequoia Capital. The company is expected to raise capital through the sale of as much as $1 billion in junk bonds this year, as well as a possible initial public offering. **********Most established grocers have only dabbled in the on-line market, like Albertson's Inc., which is testing an Internet store in Dallas for nonperishables only, or Wholefoods, which ships nonperishable natural foods from its headquarters in Austin, Tex., and a few perishables from a site in Southern California. **********''We think this is all good for the space,'' said John Fischer, interactive marketing director for Wholefoods.com, of the Webvan expansion plans. ''We have a niche that can only benefit from the expansion of the market.'' **********Unlike earlier Internet grocers, who relied on human shoppers racing down aisles to fill on-line orders, Webvan's operation is highly automated. Webvan opened its Bay Area service on June 2. Customers can place orders on line all day, seven days a week and select a convenient delivery time within 30 minutes. Orders are delivered the same day or up to five days later. **********Chris Mannella, Webvan's vice president for marketing, said the two-year Bechtel deal would enable the company ''to accelerate the national rollout we had planned.'' Bechtel, based in San Francisco, said most of the 26 centers would involve retrofitting existing warehouses. **********''Our partnership with Bechtel is a major step forward for our company,'' Mr. Borders, Webvan's chief executive, said in a statement. ''It accelerates our distribution capabilities, and it enables us to focus fully on our core competency, delivering a superior product directly to a customer's home or office.'' **********Mr. Borders co-founded Borders Books in 1971, before selling it to the Kmart Corporation in the early 1990's. Since that time he has been chairman of Mercury Capital Management, a small investment firm, and a consultant to other companies."

But it is the time when most of them were young. **********So, like it or not, a patina of nostalgia, or at least kitsch, has spread over that gray world of communal apartments, chronic shortages, propaganda slogans, controlled newspapers and political taboos. **********The door to the popular club Petrovich, in the basement of a nondescript building off Mesnitskaya Street, has five clumsy doorbells, just as the old communal apartments had. The membership card is a Communist Party ticket. Inside, window sills and walls are packed with junky memorabilia from the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1991. **********Outside the toilets hangs a glossy black-and-white photograph of a large group of men in ill-fitting suits and women with beehive hairdos under a statue of Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader who died in 1982. The caption identifies them as an ''all-Union conference of psychiatrists'' held in 1977 in Mr. Brezhnev's native city, Dneprodzerzhinsk. **********On the menu, a pancake with caviar is called ''No to Racism!'' -- after a typical slogan of a May Day parade. And tongue with horseradish is labeled Gensec, the Soviet contraction for the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the title by which all the leaders, from Stalin to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, were formally known. **********This is stuff any Russian who remembers past 1991 would appreciate, as they would the patched accordion their grandfather kept on a shelf, the washed-out postcards perched in the glass bookcase, the old taxi meter that never worked, the cheery girl on the cover of Soviet Peasant or the volume titled ''Book of Useful Advice,'' much of it contributed by clients. **********''The idea was to recreate the forgotten years; the communal apartment, the Soviet 'middle class,' the herring, the pickles, the postcards,'' said Yekaterina Razgovora, a manager of Petrovich. ''People feel at ease here. They feel at home. This is an era they all remember, a youth they can appreciate.'' **********Interest in Soviet memorabilia is hardly new, at least among tourists. Many of the trappings of the old Bolshevik empire -- military caps, Red Army belt buckles, old medals, Kremlin phones and anything with Lenin on it -- went on sale as soon as the Soviet Union went under. **********The tourist trade marches on unabated today in places like the pedestrian mall of the Old Arbat, where Soviet coins, flags and other trinkets are displayed alongside the mandatory T-shirts of ''McLenin,'' with the founder of the Soviet state chomping into a Big Mac. **********There is also a considerable minority of Russians who openly and actively bemoan that December day in 1991 when the red flag went down over the Kremlin. In an irony that probably eludes them, many have taken their fervor to the Internet, where they vent their frustrations on sites ranging from Pravda to one dedicated to preserving Lenin's mausoleum. **********On the site, Lenin's niece, Olga Ulianova, argues that ''it is absolutely clear that reburying him might provoke the most unpredictable consequences for our Fatherland.'' She offers no hint what they may be. **********Olga Ulianova may not feel comfortable in Petrovich. But those Russians who couldn't dump their Soviet junk fast enough when the old order collapsed are those who now find themselves attracted to echoes from the past. **********Even in the glittering shopping mall under the Manezh Square, whose three underground floors of shops are unabashedly aimed at Moscow's nouveaux riches, one of the stands in the food court is called Dining Room No. 14, as it might have been in the Soviet days, when most shops and eateries were identified only by a naked number. **********You find it on television, too. A commercial for a brand of Indian tea that used to be in great demand, and was in great shortage, in the Soviet Union starts with black-and-white images of a man proudly bringing the familiar package with an elephant on it home to an admiring family. The package acquires color and a voice intones, ''The tea you remember.'' **********Foreign companies have not failed to recognize the draw of the past. Dannon, the yogurt maker, markets a ''classic kefir,'' made to taste like the yogurt-like dairy product Russians grew up on. **********One of the more popular shows on television, ''Old Apartment,'' draws huge audiences on Sundays focusing on something from the past and finding people who remember to discuss it. Grigory Gurvich, the host, says the discussions often get emotional. **********''Of course, those who remember the past seriously remember a hell, a nightmare, especially the communal apartments,'' Mr. Gurvich said. ''But as Yevgeny Yevtushenko said when he was on recently, it was a horror, but that's how we grew up. We were young.'' **********Besides, Mr. Gurvich noted, few Russians today still remember the horror of the Gulag and the repression. For most, their memories of the Soviet Union are of the ''Period of Stagnation'' under Mr. Brezhnev and his aging successors, when repression gave way to enforced mediocrity, boredom and shortages of virtually everything but propaganda. It was a time when the focus of life shifted to steamy kitchens, the search for goods, and treasured glimpses of the glittering West in movies, television  shows and books. **********It is this world that Petrovich tries to recreate -- in a mushroom julienne named ''Petrovich's dream of Paris, where he has not yet been,'' or in the black-and-white movies about the triumphs of a young Bolshevik in agriculture that play constantly over the bar. **********''Sometimes I wonder if my kids will ever believe what it was like,'' said a businessman in his 30's, whose wife works for a Western car company. ''I try to tell them about the lines, about living in a two-room apartment with their grandparents, about how nervous we were if we met a foreigner. **********''They just look at me as if I'm describing an alien land. I am.''"

Michael Armstrong has become an experience akin to watching one film sequel after another in the ''Jaws'' series. **********Just when you thought that Mr. Armstrong, AT&T's chairman of 18 months, could not possibly bite off another big deal, he does just that, and the masses in the communications industry are sent fleeing to find ways to cope. **********Last week's casualty may have been the Comcast Corporation, the big cable television operator. Just when it looked as if AT&T had settled down to manage its own $31.8 billion acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable carrier, Mr. Armstrong swam into the middle of Comcast's pending $53 billion deal for the Mediaone Group and roiled the waters with an unsolicited bid for AT&T to buy Mediaone for $58 billion. **********Comcast may still win the batlle, but many analysts say that AT&T, with its superior financial power, will likely beat Comcast and win Mediaone -- if regulators allow it. That would make AT&T the nation's No. 1 cable television company, in addition to the nation's No. 1 long-distance telephone carrier. **********But like a voracious shark that ends up with a bunch of old license plates in its belly, AT&T may have a tough time digesting everything it has tried to swallow. The main question for AT&T now is whether its appetite has exceeded its ability to integrate its businesses into the lean yet powerful communications machine that Mr. Armstrong wants AT&T to become. **********As Mr. Armstrong propels AT&T headlong into the future he has envisioned, the company faces mounting challenges -- not only of management and strategy, but also of regulation and technology. **********Perhaps the most daunting management challenge for AT&T is the sheer breadth of Mr. Armstrong's strategic ambition. After John Zeglis, AT&T's president, was conspicuously absent during the company's Mediaone announcement last Thursday, several analysts wondered where he was. **********It turned out he was in Japan. There, over the weekend, AT&T and British Telecommunications, AT&T's new international partner, announced a joint investment of more than $1.8 billion to acquire a 30 percent stake in Japan Telecom, a communications carrier backed by the main Japanese railroad company. **********AT&T and British Telecommunications will also fold into Japan Telecom two of their existing Japanese ventures, with combined annual revenue of just more than $200 million. **********The announcement's near simultaneity with the Mediaone bid was either impressive or unnerving, because it demonstrated Mr. Armstrong's comfort with juggling multiple deals. In fact, the Japan Telecom and Mediaone deals ''are part of the same strategy,'' Mr. Zeglis said over the weekend. ''We want to go end-to-end delivering services for our customers on our own architecture.'' **********Despite AT&T's common goal of controlling its own architecture, or electronic infrastructure, there is a big difference between these two deals. AT&T's overseas ventures are aimed at serving big-ticket multinational corporate clients, while the company's cable television expansion is aimed at serving everyday residential consumers. And it is the company's hunger for residential customers that best explains AT&T's seeming feeding frenzy. **********It is clear by now that AT&T is terrified of the prospect of at least one of the local Bell phone companies, probably Bell Atlantic, being poised to win regulatory approval to enter AT&T's core long-distance business this year. **********By way of a harbinger, AT&T is well aware of what happened in Connecticut after the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation, which did not need special approval, began offering long-distance service to Southern New England's local phone customers. Large numbers of Connecticut customers dropped long-distance service from AT&T, among others, to take a single package of local and long distance from S.N.E.T. **********AT&T's strategic planners hate to contemplate the millions of local phone customers who might drop AT&T phone service once Bell Atlantic is freed to offer long-distance service to customers along the Eastern Seaboard, or even just in New York. It is a much bigger worry for AT&T than for its principal long-distance rivals, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, because AT&T derives a much higher proportion of its long-distance revenue from residential consumers than do MCI and Sprint. **********Mr. Armstrong has decided that the solution is to counterattack the Bells by taking the war to a new front -- off the conventional local telephone network and onto cable TV systems. Through those cable lines, AT&T intends to offer local and long-distance calling, as well as Internet service. **********It will probably take a few years to determine whether that strategy is visionary or foolhardy. AT&T would like to offer its cable-based services using a variant of Internet technology. Because this is a largely experimental approach, it poses large technical challenges. It may, however, prove easier in Mediaone territories than in TCI areas, because Mediaone's network is generally more technically advanced. That is why AT&T is willing to pay more for Mediaone than it did for TCI, even though TCI has more customers. **********The cable strategy also raises management questions. AT&T is well practiced in telephone-network technology, but linking so much of its future to cable television networks means the company needs to rely on experts from outside the AT&T tradition. Foremost among them is Leo Hindery, the former No. 2 executive at TCI who now runs AT&T's cable operation -- but who is still largely unfamiliar with AT&T and its culture in offering telephone service. The same could be said for the highly respected Amos B. Hostetter, Mediaone's largest shareholder, who AT&T has said will become chairman of its cable and Internet unit if its Mediaone bid succeeds. **********But before Mr. Hostetter can come aboard, AT&T must not only fend off Comcast, but also convince Federal regulators that a combined AT&T-TCI-Mediaone would not wield disproportionate power in the cable television industry. Under Federal Communications Commission ownership rules, no single entity can control cable systems that together are available to more than 35 percent of the nation's households. But those rules have been suspended pending a review by the F.C.C. **********And there are financial imponderables. AT&T -- with backing from Chase Manhattan Bank and Goldman, Sachs & Company -- seems set to raise $30 billion in cash to support its Mediaone bid. But Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency, said on Friday that it was considering downgrading AT&T's debt to reflect the big financial burden the company will take on if it acquires Mediaone. **********The stakes for Mr. Armstrong, not to mention AT&T, are high. And they keep escalating. If the cable strategy works well, he will become known as one of the most visionary and dynamic executives of his day. If it does not, business history might one day recall him as a former I.B.M. executive who was passed over for the top job at that company and who, later, when given the chance to run AT&T, tried to prove too much. **********For now, at least, dynamic seems to be winning. And Mr. Armstrong, presumably, is looking for his next ''Jaws'' sequel."

A year after my first child, Marian, was born, my wife got a job offer she couldn't refuse. But the job was 1,000 miles away. **********So until Marian was 3, Mommy came home on weekends and I was Marian's only parent during the week. During that time, I did many dumb things, but had to take her to the emergency room only once and learned not to change her diaper on an airplane as she squirmed on my lap. (The time I did, the man next to me moved to another seat after giving me his cocktail napkin.) **********If I hadn't been thrown into Daddy skills, I wouldn't have developed them. But in my wife's absence, I had to focus on Marian as hard as I focused on my job. With my next three children, I knew what I was doing. **********Many men, however, don't care to know. They have always thought that to succeed at work, they have to limit their responsibilities at home. **********But what if you combine the domains? Can you take skills that make you effective at the office and apply them to raising children? And can you take domestic skills to the office? **********Tom Hirschfeld, a venture capitalist at Patricof & Company who lives in Brooklyn, says you can. In his new book, ''Business Dad: How Good Businessmen Can Make Great Fathers (and Vice Versa),'' published by Little, Brown, he follows in the tradition of books that seek to draw management lessons from the likes of Attila the Hun, Jesus Christ and Pat Riley. But ''Business Dad,''  with chapter headings like ''The Org Chart,'' ''Conflict Resolution'' and ''Human Capital'' -- makes the point that raising a family isn't much different from doing a deal. **********Mr. Hirschfeld had an epiphany one night while he and his son, Benjamin, now 5, debated bedtime. ''I realized it was like negotiating deals,'' he said in an interview. ''I found that skills I had in the office could be often very useful to me as a father.'' **********Skills like discipline. ''Most business dads have heard of 'management by objective,' in which employees sign onto certain quarterly or annual goals,'' he writes. ''You can apply the same technique to discipline by getting specific about what you want from your children and what will happen if they do it or don't do it.'' **********Mr. Hirschfeld wrote the book with his wife, Julie, a psychologist. She told me that many fathers don't feel competent taking care of children and often make the kinds of mistakes that drive their wives crazy. **********''How could you not put a sweater in a diaper bag at the end of October?'' she asked. ''If you can manage deals in Frankfurt and Texas in your head, you can notice that you need a sweater in a diaper bag in October.'' **********Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, director of the Child Study Center at New York University,  doubts that business skills offer the best approach to parenting. But if dads can relate to the idea, it's worth a try, he said. **********''The average American dad is spending about 10 minutes of quality time with their children'' a day, he said. ''In general, middle- and upper-middle-class men are doing more than their fathers did, but women still are doing more than their mothers. They are working, and they still have the lion's share of household responsibilities.'' **********Wess Roberts, author of ''Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun'' (Warner Books), said Mr. Hirschfeld might be pushing management metaphors too far. ''You should leave the father at home and leave the executive at work,'' he said. ''You have to make calculated decisions at work. If you make calculated decisions at home, I think that wrecks the family environment.'' **********Mr. Roberts says that even Attila separated family and work. From what he knows about him, Mr. Roberts said, ''he would have been a very loving and doting father.  He wouldn't have tried to be king of the Huns at home.''"

And despite the surge in November, Mr. Dudley and other forecasters estimate that the economy grew at an annual rate of at least 4 percent in the fourth quarter. **********Things are likely to get worse before they get better, and further deterioration in the trade deficit may well slow the pace of what has become the longest peacetime expansion in United States history. **********Although the Asian economic crisis may be easing, growth in Europe is slowing and much of Latin America is stagnating or slipping into recession. **********What is more, any lift that American exports get from the weaker dollar will most likely take months to materialize. Most forecasters think that the trade deficit will keep getting bigger, although not as rapidly as in parts of 1998. **********Exports, which have been declining for most of the last year, fell by an additional 2 percent in November. The hardest-hit category was capital equipment -- aircraft, trucks and computers -- which accounts for nearly one-quarter of United States foreign sales. **********At the same time, imports of construction gear, machine tools and other capital equipment soared -- suggesting that American businesses were not cutting back as much on new investment as some economists had feared. **********The rise in the trade deficit is actually worse than the figures indicate because import prices have been falling in dollar terms as the currencies of Asian and Latin American countries have weakened and the world market for raw materials from copper to oil has plunged. On average, imported goods are 3.5 percent cheaper than a year earlier, while the cost of foreign petroleum products is down more than 34 percent. That means the volume of imports is even bigger than the statistics would indicate. **********Because of seasonal quirks in the Commerce Department's trade statistics, the figures typically look deceptively good in the fourth quarter. The fact that the fourth-quarter numbers look as bad as they do at this point does not bode well for the current quarter. **********Politically, the bulging trade deficit has become a serious concern for the Clinton Administration, underscored by the President's harsh words for Japanese steelmakers in his State of the Union address Tuesday night and his call for a new round of global trade talks. The Administration had already been urging the Europeans to import more, saying that the United States could not be the importer of only resort. **********Although the deficits with Japan and China appeared to narrow, indicating that the recent weakening of the dollar against the yen was having some effect, the true picture is hard to measure because trade figures from those countries, which are not seasonally adjusted, among other things, are widely questioned. **********Many American manufacturers have been hurt by intense price competition over the last year, and weak export markets have helped whittle  away their profits, touching off a painful round of cutbacks and layoffs. **********The growing trade imbalance also has some potentially negative implications for the dollar, as Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned in his testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday. The United States' rapidly expanding current-account deficit -- a broad measure of the nation's international transactions that covers not only trade but also overseas transactions such as tourism, investments, services and brokerage fees -- is becoming sufficiently large to call into question foreign investors' willingness to keep putting money into United States assets at the current pace. If the appetite for United States assets no longer keeps pace with Americans' appetite for imports, the dollar comes under a lot of pressure. **********That said, the trade deficit continues to be a boon to an economy that has been running flat out. Because American resources are stretched to the limit, with unemployment at its lowest level in a generation, the trade deficit is an important safety valve that helps keep inflation at bay. **********''If we had not had all the imports, the economy would have had to expand far beyond its capacity to do so,'' said Pierre Ellis of Primark Decision Economics. ''It's hard to believe that we wouldn't have had more inflation.'' **********If, for example, the trade deficit had not worsened this year, the economy would have had to grow 5.5 percent, instead of the estimated 4 percent or so, to keep up with roaring domestic demand. It is also hard to see how real incomes could have risen as they did if imports and foreign competition had not held down the prices of a wide variety of goods from clothes and heating oil to electronic gadgets. **********A separate report yesterday from the Department of Labor hinted at a possible softening in the tight labor market. First-time unemployment claims fell by 14,000, to 346,000 for the week ending on Jan. 16. But the four-week moving average, which economists prefer because it gives a truer reading of the underlying trend, rose to its highest level since early 1996 except for the period during a strike against General Motors last summer."

That network has gradually morphed into today's Internet, which 200 million people around the world use, misuse, cherish and curse. **********About three years ago, a project called Internet2 began. It involves a a new high-speed data backbone connecting universities, much like the way they were connected in the original Arpanet. It is one of several attempts to steer a future course for the connected world, a reinvention of the Net meant to feed new technologies to the public eventually. But opinion is divided on whether it is the bridge to the 21st century or an expensive dead end. **********Proponents of the Internet2 project, whose users are almost exclusively at universities, say it is a unique sandbox in which researchers can conduct experiments in areas like advanced videoconference techniques, virtual reality and telemedicine. They say the technological innovations to emerge from the project will quickly filter down to the ''commodity'' Internet, as the general Internet is sometimes called. **********Critics, on the other hand, say the project is falling short of its original goals, that it has little technical innovation to show for three years of work and that much of Internet2's prodigious capacity often stands idle. Further, they say, the expense to universities outweighs the project's usefulness to faculty and students. **********Internet2 started with much fanfare in 1996 as a high-capacity private network for researchers at universities to use for developing and testing futuristic applications that require a lot of bandwidth. **********''The people who started Internet2 were looking back on this kind of nostalgically as the days when universities had the Net to themselves and now they don't,'' said Vinton G. Cerf, an Internet leader who is senior vice president for Internet architecture and technology at MCI Worldcom, which supplies part of the high-speed backbone for Internet2. ''And now they were all going to get together and build their own backbone. They seemed to be moving back to the stage where they had a Net to themselves.'' **********The promise surrounding the new network held a definite appeal for those who joined. ''Internet2 was built largely on a field of dreams -- if you build it, they will come,'' said Ira Fuchs, the vice president for computing and information technology  at Princeton University, an Internet2 member. ''The hope was that you build the infrastructure, make it available, and there will be applications.'' **********Since its inception, Internet2 has grown to include 163 member institutions; it has the backing of 20 corporate partners. Astronomers use the network to send huge data sets from telescopes and to manipulate those faraway telescopes. Medical researchers use it to view complex anatomical models from many miles away. Successful demonstrations of high-definition television transmissions have taken place over the network. And network specialists at several universities are using the Internet2 project to conduct experiments in computer networking itself. **********Internet2 is similar to the Internet in its earlier days in that its use is limited to those universities and a handful of corporate research centers that pay for the high-speed connection. If a researcher at an institution wants to send data to a researcher elsewhere over Internet2, both institutions must belong to the network. **********The cost to universities is high. Helped by subsidies from the National Science Foundation, each campus pays $500,000 to $1 million or more a year to gain local access to the high-speed Internet2 backbone and upgrade its campus network so the network can deliver data to campus desktops at a guaranteed speed of at least 10 megabits per second, which is 10 million bits per second. That is nearly 200 times as fast as a modem handling 56,000 bits per second. **********But the foundation is scheduled to discontinue its subsidies next April, and some Internet2 members are beginning to view the cost as an unwelcome burden. ''Someone forgot to tell the universities how expensive Internet2 will be when the subsidies go away,'' said David J. Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. At most universities, Dr. Farber said, faculty involvement in Internet2-related projects is minimal, at best. **********Mr. Fuchs of Princeton said he knew of no universities that are seriously considering withdrawing from the project. But Mr. Fuchs, Dr. Farber and others agreed that additional funds generated by faculty research grants were crucial to help defray the cost of the network. **********''Without campuswide support, the bill will be more than the administrator will be willing to pay,'' Dr. Farber said. **********Applications that require a high-capacity network are at the center of the project's charter. One project, still in the formative phase, is called Gumbo, which stands for Grand Unified Modeling of Biological Organisms. Led by researchers at the California Institute of Technology, the project will create highly ambitious computer models of biological systems by having computers at many places on the network work on pieces of the problem, a strategy called distributed computing. **********Another project, perhaps the one best suited to Internet2, is called tele-immersion; it is under the direction of Jaron Lanier, who is known for his work with virtual reality and is also the co-director of the Gumbo project. Tele-immersion, an advanced form of virtual reality, lets users in different places interact in real time in a shared simulated environment, making them feel as if they were in the same room. Instead of the gear often associated with virtual reality -- body suits, goggles, gloves -- tele-immersion uses a ''tele-cubicle,''  which is equipped with large screens, scanners, sensors and cameras. **********''With prior forms of virtual reality, you're in an entirely synthetic environment so that people end up looking like cartoons,'' Mr. Lanier said. ''With tele-immersion, the goal is complete realism so that people look real, they feel real and the environment they're in, such as their office, feels real and you feel like you're really there.'' Mr. Lanier said he hoped that the project would be ready for a full working demonstration by  April. **********''YOU'LL be able to see me just as if I was right in front of you, in three dimensions,'' said Allan H. Weis, chief executive of Advanced Network and Services, a nonprofit organization based in Armonk, N.Y., that is an Internet2 corporate partner and is sponsoring the tele-immersion project. ''You can touch me on a shoulder, and I'll feel it.'' **********Tele-immersion is ideal for Internet2, Mr. Lanier said. ''The goal is to stress the network,'' he said. ''We're really trying to push Internet2 to its limit. **********Applications like tele-immersion require what network researchers call quality of service, the ability to assign priorities and types of service to different types of data. **********''If you're transmitting an X-ray of someone's lung, you can't afford losses of data, said Lawrence Landweber, a professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. ''You've got to get it all because you don't want to miss that spot on the lung. But you can have it be delayed. If you're looking at a real-time video of somebody, on the other hand, and you're interacting with them, you can't afford to have a delay, but you can lose some data.'' **********Greg Wood, an Internet2 spokesman, said a plan for introducing quality of service over Internet2 would be tested in the next six months. **********Skeptics say Internet2 suffers from a dearth of highly demanding applications. Projects like tele-immersion, Dr. Landweber said, are the exception, not the rule. **********As a result, the actual utilization of the network is far below its capacity. Aside from an occasional burst of activity, which can make parts of the network run at as much as 100 percent of capacity, the usual utilization figure hovers around 1 percent. **********Douglas Van Houweling, president of the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development, a nonprofit organization that oversees the Internet2 project, sees it differently. As long as people are using the new system to run applications that do not take full advantage of its capacity, the network will be underutilized. ''The key is to raise people's eyes to see a new horizon of advanced Internet applications,'' he said, ''and I think that's clearly happening, but it's not happening overnight.'' **********The job of drumming up interest among faculty members has fallen to Ted Hanss, Internet2's self-described evangelist -- his  official title is director of applications development. He is frequently on the road, visiting campuses to raise awareness among faculty members. ''To engage faculty, you need to give them confidence that there's a long-term commitment on the part of university administrators to keep the infrastructure,'' Mr. Hanss said. ''They don't want to be told it's going away.'' **********The group of companies providing the Internet2 backbone has made a firm commitment to keep it in service until 2003. What might happen after that is unclear. ''We'll work to insure high-performance network capabilities among universities beyond 2003,'' Mr. Wood said. ''That's part of our mission.'' **********Unlike the original Internet, which gradually metamorphosed into a network for the general public, Internet2 will most likely remain, in some form, in the academic domain. **********''It's not our intention to take the Internet2 backbone and make it a public thing, but to make what we learn in the project a public thing,'' Dr. Van Houweling said. ''I don't know that we'll ever name it Internet 3 or 4. But the whole objective is that the things we do become a part of the Internet that everyone is able to use.'' **********Part of that technology transfer will take place through the project's corporate partners, Dr. Van Houweling said. ''Let's say we figure out a way of doing quality of service,'' he said. ''Then Cisco and others will adopt those standards in their products and ship them out to commodity consumers.'' **********It is precisely such companies that are stealing a march on Internet2, the project's critics say. ''I'm not sure what Internet2 has taught us about building the next-generation network,'' Dr. Landweber said. ''The reality today is there's a lot of interesting work, but it's mostly being done in the bowels of companies like Cisco, AT&T and Lucent.'' **********At 2.4 gigabits per second, Internet2 may be fast, but, some of its critics say, not fast enough. ''If you said you'd supply a network with a bandwidth of 5 gigabits to my department, I'd say, 'Hey that's an interesting field of dreams,' '' Dr. Farber said. ''But Internet2 is nowhere near that.'' Dr. Cerf of MCI Worldcom agreed. ''My sense is that it isn't far enough ahead of where industry is,'' he said. **********Dr. Van Houweling, however, said the capacity of Abilene, part of the Internet2 backbone, would quadruple in the next year, to nearly 10 megabits per second. ''All of our forward thinking is based on the assumption that we're going to have a hard time keeping up with the demands of the applications,'' he said. **********Membership in Internet2 is not a requirement for high-speed data transmission. MCI Worldcom recently announced vBNS+, a commercial service that is similar to one the company already provides for a portion of Internet2 traffic. The new vBNS+ service is now available to all college campuses as well as to corporate research laboratories. **********That announcement caught the eye of Michael Ribaudo, who is university dean for instructional technology and information services at the City University of New York. Mr. Ribaudo, who oversees his university's technology purchases, held his university back from joining Internet2, and all of the peripheral expenses that go with it, when it started, and now he considers himself vindicated. **********''I think I've been proven correct to buy the bandwidth as a commodity item from a provider such as MCI,'' he said. ''It's a smarter way to go.'' **********Mr. Ribaudo hastened to add that he was not speaking for all universities. ''I'm just saying that Internet2 isn't for everyone.''"

Spending rose four-tenths of a percent after a gain of three-tenths of a percent a month earlier. **********The July increase in income was the smallest since the end of last year because Federal disaster payments had increased farmers' income in June. Excluding farmers, personal incomes rose five-tenths of a percent last month, the same as in June. **********''The economy will continue to grow with limited interruptions,'' said Richard Yamarone, a senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. If growth continues through January, the expansion will be 107 months old and the longest in United States history. **********Pay increases at factories helped bring about a seven-tenths of a percent increase in wages and salaries, which account for about 60 percent of income. That was the biggest increase since January. **********Wages and salaries at manufacturers, where pay tends to run higher than in service-producing jobs, rose eight-tenths of a percent. The rise last month in factory wages was the strongest since a 1.2 percent jump in August 1998, Government figures showed. **********The increase in consumption was paced by a rise of six-tenths of a percent in spending on utilities and other services, ''as air-conditioning use was boosted by the summer heat wave which enveloped much of the country,'' said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York. **********Spending on durable goods was lifted by demand for autos, analysts said. Sales of cars and light trucks rose to 17.1 million units at an annual rate in July, up from 17 million units in June, auto makers reported earlier this month. **********The nation's savings rate, meanwhile, came in at minus 1.4 percent, compared with minus 1.1 percent in June. The rate accounts for neither capital gains from investments nor improvement in home values, something that consumers may be counting on to pay for future expenses like retirement. **********In addition, the report assumes that installment purchases that can be paid off in two or three years are one-day cash purchases. That is why many economists say they think Americans are saving more than the statistics indicate. **********Separately, the University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence fell to 104.5 in August from 106 in July. The index, which fell to 97.4 last October, has ranged between 103.9 and 108.1 this year."

Nearly all Republicans and a few influential Democrats said yes. The vast majority of Democrats said no. **********But that divide obscured a somewhat remarkable agreement among almost all voices in the debate. From the most liberal to the most conservative, they concluded that the power of the stock market to generate substantial returns over the long run should be used to help close the gap between the benefits that Social Security has promised to today's workers and the system's ability to pay them. **********Mr. Clinton and Democrats in Congress said the Social Security system itself, not individuals, should do the investing, so that everyone would benefit or bear the risks equally. Advocates of private accounts said individuals should have more control over their financial futures, and that collective investment would result in de facto government ownership of private industry. **********One way or another, Wall Street seems destined to play a role in dealing with the problem. **********THE TRUST FUND -- Since its establishment during the New Deal, Social Security has worked in the same way: Today's workers pay a levy on their earnings; the revenue  goes toward paying current retirees. Any excess -- payroll tax revenue beyond what is immediately needed to pay benefits -- is theoretically parked in a trust fund that can be used down the road to pay benefits when needed. **********Only in the last year has it become clear to people other than policy types and actuaries that the trust fund is basically an accounting fiction. Excess Social Security revenue is not tucked away in the sense that the phrase ''trust fund'' suggests. Because of the way the government keeps its books, that excess can be used in only three ways: for general government spending, as was done each year until 1998; for a tax cut; or to reduce the national debt, as is being done now. **********No matter how the excess is used, the government still deposits an i.o.u. in that amount with the Social Security system. The i.o.u. is nothing more than a promise to pay back the money, almost certainly out of general tax receipts or through increased government borrowing. The i.o.u.'s are not real assets like stocks or bonds, and they do not even represent cash, since the government cannot deposit cash with itself as if it were a bank. **********The trust fund now contains i.o.u.'s totaling $865 billion. The amount is projected to peak at $4.5 trillion in 2022, when the system will have to begin redeeming them to pay benefits to retiring baby boomers. **********In other words, if benefits are to be maintained after 2022, the government will either have to dip into general revenue or borrow from the public to make good on the $4.5 trillion. And even so, after the i.o.u.'s run out sometime around 2034, Social Security will be able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits unless changes are made. **********GENERATIONAL EQUITY -- Finally, there was a dawning recognition that solving Social Security's problems would require tradeoffs between the needs of today's workers -- overwhelmingly the baby boomers, who are at a peak of political and economic influence -- and later generations. **********If the boomers cannot rally themselves to find a consensus and make sacrifices and compromises now, the bill will be dumped into the laps of their children and grandchildren. **********And who is to say that they'll be in any mood to pay it?"

The new Paraguayan Interior Minister, Walter Bower, said it would respect Argentina's decision. **********General Oviedo's flight here on Sunday night to seek asylum and the request for his extradition put Argentina in the middle of a political crisis in Paraguay. The situation boiled over on Tuesday with the assassination of Vice President Luis Maria Argana and intensified on Sunday with the forced resignation of President Raul Cubas. **********A Paraguayan judge today ordered Mr. Cubas to be placed under house arrest on charges of negligent homicide stemming from the deaths of several protesters last week. Mr. Bower later said Mr. Cubas had Parliamentary immunity and could not be detained. As a former President, he is a senator for life. **********Mr. Cubas took refuge in the Brazilian Embassy residence, and Brazil accepted his asylum request. A Brazilian air force jet headed for Asuncion to take him out, and the embassy sought safe conduct for him and his family. **********The crisis dates from what was interpreted as a failed coup attempt by General Oviedo, a populist, in 1996 to oust President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. General Oviedo ran for President last year. But during the campaign he was imprisoned on charges related to that episode. That led to Mr. Cubas's election. **********When Mr. Cubas defied the Supreme Court in August and freed General Oviedo as one of his first acts in office, that set off a move to impeach him by Congressional opponents and by Mr. Argana. The assassination by men in military fatigues set off demonstrations and violence that finally forced Mr. Cubas to resign. **********Paraguayan prosecutors have accused General Oviedo of having masterminded Mr. Argana's assassination. A Paraguayan judge has also accused him of involvement in the slayings of six young demonstrators who marched against Mr. Cubas's Government last week. **********As 60,000 people gathered on the streets of Asuncion on Sunday night to celebrate the emergence of Senator Luis Gonzalez Macchi as the new President, General Oviedo spirited himself out of the country. He was arrested at a military airport outside Buenos Aires on Sunday after he and his family had arrived in a small plane without a flight plan, immigration papers or permission to land. **********At first, President Carlos Saul Menem, who was on a trade mission in Italy, told reporters that ''we are going to take our time'' before deciding whether to extradite or grant asylum. Four hours later, the Interior Ministry announced that asylum would be granted, for reasons that are unclear."

He was 81. **********From his small shop in Streatley, near Henley-on-Thames, Mr. Rance waged a determined and ultimately successful battle to raise public awareness of the traditional, raw-milk cheeses, produced in cylinders and wrapped in cloth. **********Alarmed at the rise of mass-market, industrially made cheddars, red Leicesters and Wensleydales that were being sealed in plastic and sold in supermarkets across Britain, he diligently sought out small, tradition-minded cheese makers and provided a showcase for their efforts at his little shop, where customers could buy dog food and shoelaces along with farmhouse cheddars, single Gloucesters, Swaledales and nearly 150 other cheeses. **********His life's passion culminated in ''The Great British Cheese Book,'' published in 1982. Widely praised, it led to a companion volume on French cheese, ''The French Cheese Book,'' published in 1989. **********Mr. Rance was born in Southend-on-Sea, where his father was a vicar, and grew up in Westcliff-on-Sea, where he was taken with his mother after his father's death in 1923. He attended Christ's Hospital, but told that he was not university material, enrolled at Sandhurst, the military academy, in 1936. Two years later he received a commission in the Northamptonshire Regiment. **********During World War II he served as adjutant of a battalion and rose to the rank of major. He took part in the Anzio landings and after the war did intelligence work in Vienna. **********After retiring from the army, he worked for the Conservative Central Office, where he helped start its public opinion research, but he and his new wife, Janet, nourished a peculiar ambition, to run a village shop. In 1954, the couple took over Wells Stores, which sold precisely three cheeses. By 1960 the number had swelled to 16 international cheeses, and by 1980 the shop was offering 150 cheeses, many of them the traditional British farmhouse cheeses that Mr. Rance had ferreted out on visits to farms all over Britain. **********In 1973, the national tourist board commissioned Mr. Rance to write an article on British cheese. His research so disturbed him that he decided to write a book in defense of traditional cheese. ''The hard cheeses of England and her firm-crusted blues are the finest in the world,'' he wrote. ''Apart from Stilton, they are also the least known.'' This held true even of Cheddar, which he called ''our most generous gift to humanity,'' because only one in 100 consumers ever bit into the real thing. **********In ''The Great British Cheese Book,'' Mr. Rance offered a region-by-region survey that traced the history of cheeses like Cheshire, Gloucester and Cheddar and the traditional way of making them. Each chapter included a list of farms still producing the old varieties. **********Mr. Rance brought high drama to the subject. His search for a genuine Blue Vinney, Dorset's greatest cheese, reads like a thriller, with Mr. Rance unmasking frauds, following threadlike leads to remote farmhouses, and slashing away with great energy at the enemies of cheese -- notably the Milk Marketing Board and the industrial-scale dairies, whose block cheeses, he believed, had all the flavor of plexiglass. **********With the publication of ''The Great British Cheese Book,'' which was hailed by food authorities like Elizabeth David and Jane Grigson, Mr. Rance, who presided over his shop wearing a monocle, became a national figure. He was Britain's leading expert on traditional cheese, the man who helped rescue such endangered species as Montgomery's cheddar, Keene's cheddar and Appleby's cheshire. **********In the 1980's, he and his wife bought a stone farmhouse in Fontvieille, Provence, where he wrote ''The French Cheese Book.'' **********He is survived by seven children."

The shares went from just over โฌ1 early in 1996 to more than โฌ18 in the spring of 1998 but have since fallen to โฌ7.25 ($7.75) **********One problem has been with the British and American markets, perceived as rich pickings for a product that reduces cholesterol. Delayed U.S. government approvals were partly to blame, giving the Unilever Group a chance to introduce a competing and less expensive product called Take Control. **********Anna Hakkarainen, an analyst at D. Carnegie AB Finland, estimated that Benecol costs about 75 percent more than Take Control. **********Raisio's problems deepened in September when it warned its 1999 profit would fall 50 percent from a year earlier, in part because of rising prices for the Benecol ingredient stanol. Demand was so high for Benecol that Raisio had to farm out manufacturing to costly subcontractors. **********Still, some analysts contend that Benecol is the better product and will beat Take Control in the long run. Ritva Ojala, food industry analyst at Conventum Securities Ltd. in Helsinki, said that Benecol was proven to reduce by 14 percent the cholesterol consumed by its users, while Take Control cuts just 9 percent. In addition, Raisio's U.S. partner is McNeil Consumer Nutritionals Ltd., whose parent is Johnson & Johnson, a company that boasts an army of 30,000 medical sales representatives, providing an entree to the health industry. ""It your doctor tells you to buy Benecol,"" Ms. Ojala said, ""it is not a matter of price anymore."" **********This week, Raisio said Benecol had garnered 70 percent of the U.S. market for cholesterol-cutting spreads in August. **********Ms. Ojala estimated that about 3 percent of the Finnish population are on Benecol diets and sees a great potential in such markets as Britain and the United States, where there is ""a high-cholesterol problem."" **********Ms. Ojala set a target price of โฌ14.45 for the next 12 months. **********Some analysts point out that a key cause for concern is the licensing agreement Raisio has concluded with McNeil. The terms dictate that McNeil pay Raisio a given amount per kilogram of stanol ester sold, the active ingredient of Benecol, which could come in margarine, salad dressing or cream cheese. Raisio does not disclose at what price it sells the cholesterol-reducing agent to the U.S. company, and this has tossed Helsinki analysts into a mind-numbing guessing game. **********""The question is who makes money,"" said Ms. Hakkarianen of Carnegie. **********Many analysts suspect that McNeil talked Raisio into an unfair deal. While Raisio will share in the growth of Benecol sales overseas, benefits arising from any form of value-added or creative sales technique would profit McNeil, not Raisio, said Matti Hautsalo, strategist at BBL Finland Oy in Helsinki, which is part of the ING Group. **********Raisio actually sold the rights to market Benecol products outside of Finland to McNeil, and while partnering with Johnson & Johnson gives it a leverage in the U.S. market, the same may not be the case in Asia, where Unilever's presence is larger. **********""If Raisio had a strong negotiating power, they would have had different partners in different continents,"" said Mr. Hautsalo. **********Indeed, some analysts said the question is not so much whether Benecol will succeed overseas, but, rather, whether one should buy Raisio or Johnson & Johnson to profit from it. **********Still Mr. Hautsalo said Raisio is cheap at its current price, though Ms. Hakkarainen of Carnegie said it would underperform the market because of the uncertainty surrounding the profit-sharing agreement with Raisio's partner McNeil. **********Another problem that analysts noted was that the actual value of sales in Britain and the United States is not disclosed by Raisio. The company's reticence to provide the numbers is one reason for the weak stock price, they said."

It's well known that Mr. Gibson conceived of cyberspace, which he defined variously as ''a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system'' and a ''consensual hallucination,'' before he even used a computer: he wrote ''Neuromancer'' on a manual typewriter. **********What is perhaps less well known is that a large part of the inspiration for ''cyberspace'' resulted from his first experience wearing a Sony Walkman in the summer of 1981. **********''I had gone into a small neighborhood electronics store, never even having heard of the Walkman,'' he said in an interview from Vancouver. ''They had one on display and the guy told me, 'You're not going to believe this.' **********''I haven't had that immediate a reaction to a piece of technology before or since. I didn't analyze it at the time, but in retrospect, I recognized the revolutionary intimacy of the interface. For the first time I was able to move my nervous system through a landscape with my choice of soundtrack. **********''I immediately thought, 'I have to have this,' although I didn't have any money. I was poor back then and the Walkman cost something like 350 Canadian dollars.'' **********Mr. Gibson bought it anyway. But since he didn't own any cassette tapes, he had a friend record some music for him. ''I took the Walkman to downtown Vancouver,'' he said, ''listening to Joy Division, which I had never heard. It gave Vancouver a kind of weird totalitarian grandeur it hadn't previously had for me. I didn't take that thing off for a month.'' **********His conception of cyberspace, he said, arose after he saw a bus-stop poster for the Apple IIc that showed only the machine's CPU and keyboard, not its monitor. He became captivated with the idea of how people might process data in the future. **********''I thought, if there is an imaginary point of convergence where the information this machine handles could be accessed with the under-the-skin intimacy of the Walkman, what would that be like?'' **********Mr. Gibson no longer wears a Walkman. With success and money, he said, he now has enough CD players to satisfy his interest in music. But he is still fascinated with the idea of portable sound. ''It's almost a metaphorical realization of what we do anyway -- a souped-up version of being lost in one's own thoughts,'' he said. ''Given the conditions in which most of us increasingly live and the hard work required to obtain personal space, I think that's not entirely a bad thing.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/business/media-mainstream-tv-bets-on-gross-out-humor.html,Bill Carter,1999-07-19,"New televison shows are increasingly turning to age-old elements of adolescent male humor, body functions, scatology and coarse language, to attract young male viewers, audience favored by many advertisers; trend toward so-called 'gross-out' humor...",1531,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Mainstream TV Bets on 'Gross-Out' Humor,MEDIA; Mainstream TV Bets on 'Gross-Out' Humor," **********This summer the movies have been filled with crude language, bathroom humor and sex scenes that include the defiling of an apple pie. Brace yourself for the fall television season. **********The trend that has turned vulgarity and bodily functions into big-screen entertainment will spread to mainstream television in September, with the premiere of a Fox Network comedy called ''Action.'' The pilot contains the first all-out barrage of four-letter words ever unleashed on broadcast television -- all of them bleeped out, but easy enough to lip read -- and such moments as a prostitute putting her hand down the trousers of a movie star and a father discussing the size of his sex organ with his preteen daughter. **********It is all part of what some television executives and social scientists see as the rapid disappearance of most taste and language restrictions in mass media, a trend fueled by shifting standards of what is socially acceptable -- and what, for the television industry, is deemed to be financially necessary. **********As Doug Herzog, the president of Fox Entertainment put it: ''This is all happening because society is evolving and changing. But the bottom line is, people seem to be buying it.'' **********The main buyers, the audience at the center of this wave of what the industry calls gross-out entertainment, are boys and men under 25. Not only has this group established itself as the most loyal to Hollywood movies -- because of a desire to be the first to see the hip new film and a willingness to go back and see it several more times. It is the group favored by a long list of television advertisers. **********As a result, never before have the age-old elements of adolescent male humor -- body functions, scatology and coarse language -- dominated such a broad swath of American popular culture. The reason is scarcity; younger males traditionally watch less television than any other group. **********And yet this young male audience is willing to spend ''a lot of disposable income'' on entertainment, said Gene DeWitt, chairman of DeWitt Media, a firm that buys advertising time on television. **********At the same time, many areas of entertainment, especially television, are being fragmented into smaller and smaller niches defined by gender, age and tastes. As a result, producers and programmers who formerly sought to smooth the roughest edges of comedy in order to reach as many viewers as possible without giving offense, now are free to target young men with the kind of entertainment they most enjoy: gross-out comedy. **********''For adolescent males, there has always been an appeal in things they are told are not appropriate, and gross-out humor is one of those things,'' said Joanne Cantor, a professor of communication arts at the University of Wisconsin, who researches issues involving television and children. **********This humor has disproportionate influence because young men serve as ''the barometer of new comedy,'' said Mr. Herzog, who before moving to the News Corporation's Fox unit was head of Comedy Central, owned by Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., which gave the world that seminal gross-out series, the animated ''South Park'' (now one of the summer's leading gross-out movies).  ''From David Letterman to Conan O'Brien to Chris Rock, young men found them first. A channel like Comedy Central is naturally going to build itself as a guy channel.'' **********More broadly, several executives suggested, the public has become desensitized to sexual and scatological material because of mass exposure to news stories like President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, with its open discussions of oral sex and cigars as sex toys. **********In popular entertainment, this new freedom of raunchy expression has recently brought, in movies and on television, such previously uncontemplated sights and sounds as: *********** A teen-ager using an apple pie to masturbate in the film ''American Pie.'' *********** A talk show host vomiting into a toilet on the ''Tom Green Show'' on the MTV network. *********** A character sipping from a beverage made of excrement in the film ''Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' *********** A teen-age boy captured on a stadium's giant video screen picking his nose in a television commercial for J. C. Penney jeans. *********** A movie star (Adam Sandler) and his child co-star urinating in the direction of the Statue of Liberty in a print advertisement for the movie ''Big Daddy.'' *********** A host of animated characters, all of them supposedly children, spewing torrents of foul language in the film ''South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.'' *********** A comedian stopping women of all ages in the street and asking them if they will have sex with him, on ''The Man Show'' on Comedy Central. **********Not every entertainment industry executive is willing to attribute all this to a hunt for free-spending, heavy-breathing young men. ''Before it's about getting young men, it's about getting anybody,'' said one senior Hollywood studio executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''There's a level of desperation to all this.'' **********But young men do seem to be a favorite quarry. **********Even the scheduling of ''Action'' fits into the young-male entertainment cycle. Fox is putting it on Thursday night -- the biggest night on television for movie advertising, one of the most lucrative ad categories for television networks. And of course, many of the movies being advertised are aimed the same male audience that is the ''Action'' target. **********Trying a similar strategy is another Viacom unit, UPN, which has the lowest Nielsen ratings of the six broadcast networks and is now trumpeting its desire to attract young males. The network has added three male-appeal shows for the fall season, including two hours of a professional wrestling free-for-all show called ''W.W.F. Smackdown'' -- on Thursdays, of course. **********The senior studio executive who spoke of ''desperation'' for viewers also noted that ''every decade there is some television show that raises the bar'' on what is acceptable. A quarter-century ago it was ''Saturday Night Live''; in the mid-1980's it was ''Married With Children'' on Fox, and in the 1990's ''Seinfeld'' broke several rules, especially with an episode involving masturbation. But most executives agreed that the groundbreaking ''Seinfeld'' episode was handled with a sense of cleverness and even charm that seems to be lacking these days. **********Some social critics and some television executives assign part of the blame to the Federal law requiring a V-chip censoring device in new television sets (all new sets must have it by January 2000), and the parallel development of a ratings system to label shows for age appropriateness and for violence, sex, foul language or suggestive dialogue. Though meant to protect children, the labels and blocking options, these critics say, give producers carte blanche on vulgar (or violent) content. **********Some even worry that the labels will serve as magnets to attract children. Ms. Cantor, though, has found that the ''V'' itself is not the magnet. **********''If you just say it's violent, that doesn't attract most kids,'' said Ms. Cantor, who has done extensive research on children's reaction to violence rating labels. ''But if you tell them they shouldn't watch it, or they're too young for it, that does.'' That pattern has yet to be adequately tested for other labels, she said. **********Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Washington, cautioned that so-called male adolescent humor does not appeal only to boys. ''You hang out with some teen-agers today, and you'll hear young girls say things that would fry your hair,'' she said. **********Mr. Herzog noted that the broadcast networks are held to a different standard than cable networks when to comes to foul language or sexual content, because the broadcasters are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. He pointed out that viewers seem to simply accept such things as four-letter words on cable channels. **********As an example, he cited a moment from his days at Comedy Central, when an episode from ''South Park'' arrived so late it had to be rushed onto the air the same day. In the television version of ''South Park,'' the cartoon children frequently utter four-letter words, but they are bleeped, much in the way Fox is doing on ''Action.'' **********That night, when Mr. Herzog watched the new episode of ''South Park'' at his home, however, he heard one character utter the most common of sexual obscenities, which had gone unbleeped in the rush to complete the episode. He expected a flood of protests from viewers. ''We didn't even get one call,'' he said. **********Similarly, last week during baseball's All-Star Home Run Derby, which was carried on the ESPN cable network, several players could clearly be heard shouting obscenities when they failed to drive a ball out of the park. Mr. Herzog surmised that  if the event had been broadcast by NBC or Fox, hundreds of complaints would have been called in. ESPN reported no calls at all. **********With ''Action,'' which was originally designed to play on HBO, Fox is clearly trying to compete with cable's standards of vulgarity and sexual explicitness. And of course, the network would love to see the show establish itself as a Thursday hit with young male viewers. **********And if ''Action'' works? Imitation has always been the sincerest form of television, as the comedian Fred Allen said long ago. **********''There's no point in moralizing whether this is a good or bad thing,'' said the advertising executive, Mr. DeWitt. ''Television is a business whose purpose is gathering audiences.''"

This sort of vigorous chairmanship would most likely continue under Mr. Sasaki. **********He ran NEC's United States operations and is considered attuned to the international demands of the business, including the importance of the cost of capital and of strategic planning, concepts that do not always seem foremost in mind for Japanese executives. **********As head of the embattled semiconductor business, one that has been roiled worldwide by falling chip prices, Mr. Sasaki won praise for containing a potential disaster. While NEC has lost money on semiconductor operations, the scale of the losses is smaller than those of competitors. **********The company is expected to release revised estimates of its losses in the fiscal year that ends on March 31. In October, NEC forecast a loss of 35 billion yen, but the stronger yen and the continued erosion of profitability in the telecommunications-equipment and semiconductor markets have no doubt carved a deeper hole in its bottom line since then. **********Because of the expected loss, Moody's Investors Service said today that it was reviewing its rating on the company's senior unsecured debt, which is now at A3, four notches above junk status and just below that of a medium-investment-grade bond. **********Unlike its rivals Toshiba and Hitachi, NEC has yet to announce plans to overhaul its business, but analysts are increasingly confident that it has a restructuring program. **********''They are talking about restructuring in a way that in my experience is quite new for NEC,'' said Scott Foster, a high-technology industry analyst at ING Barings here, who met with several NEC executives last week. **********The company has the weakest balance sheet of Japan's diversified high-technology giants, with its net debt -- the liabilities that would be left if the company spent all available cash to retire debt -- exceeding equity by 187 percent. The Toshiba Corporation, which has already embarked on a wide-ranging reorganization of its operations, has net debt that exceeds its equity by 142.5 percent. **********Mr. Foster said the company had already begun to aggressively address the problems of its Packard Bell subsidiary by cutting excess capacity, contracting some manufacturing to Taiwan, laying off workers and reducing the number of models of personal computers it sells. **********Packard Bell's woes were among the factors leading to Mr. Sekimoto's departure. NEC has sunk at least $1.8 billion into Packard Bell, whose share of the personal computer market has fallen drastically since the Japanese company made its first investment in the American-based producer in 1995."

But it is her determination that sets her apart. **********Sherife Alickaj, 18, is one of a small group of ethnic Albanian women willing to say openly that they were sexually assaulted by Serbian soldiers during the chaotic exodus from Kosovo. **********Ms. Alickaj said the attack occurred a month ago when she, her sister and four female friends studying at the University of Pristina fled their apartment because of NATO bombing. Their landlord warned them that Serbian soldiers were expelling people from nearby homes. **********She, along with her friend Teuta Elshani, 20, and a third woman, who demanded anonymity, gave matching accounts of the attack in separate interviews. They said Serbian policemen stopped them at a nearby checkpoint and ordered them to produce identity cards. **********But the six young women hesitated. They were all from the Drenica region of Kosovo, the birthplace of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla group battling Yugoslav forces, and feared retaliation. They told the men they did not have their identity cards. **********Several officers then ordered them into a nearby building and searched their bags. The women were relieved when they were allowed to exit the building quickly, but dread engulfed them when two policemen insisted on escorting them home. **********Human rights investigators and medical aid workers say that so far relatively few women are reporting sexual assaults. The intense social stigma that accompanies rape in Kosovar Albanian society, particularly for women from small villages, may be making it difficult for victims to discuss such matters with strangers or even relatives, they said. **********Dr. Vincent Iacopino, whose Physicians for Human Rights team surveys refugees, said the scope of the attacks might not be known for months. ''Some of the people who are experiencing the worst may still be trapped inside Kosovo,'' he said. **********Few issues in the former Yugoslavia have become as highly charged as rape. During the hostilities in Bosnia, Serbian forces were accused of raping women as a deliberate tactic of war, operating ''rape camps'' where Muslim women were held captive and repeatedly assaulted. **********Bosnian Serb officials dismissed such charges as propaganda. They accused women of inventing the attacks and journalists and rights investigators of exaggerating their scope. **********State Department officials have received refugee reports that the Serbs were using the Hotel Karagac in the town of Pec and an army camp near the town of Djakovica in western Kosovo as rape camps for Albanian women. On Wednesday investigators from Human Rights Watch said they had evidence that as many as five women were raped a week ago by Serbian soldiers in the southern Kosovo village of Dragacin. **********Investigators from the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the first such group to classify rape as a war crime, have been interviewing the refugees, but tribunal officials declined to comment on the inquiry. **********Ms. Alickaj and the other two women said that after following them into their living room, the policemen demanded all the money in the house. When the women said they had none, a man tore a necklace from one young woman's throat, and all six were ordered into a small, concealed room. **********''There were no curtains in the window,'' Ms. Elshani said. ''They were afraid someone would see us.'' **********The policemen, saying they were conducting another search, ordered all six women to undress. Five burst into tears as they complied. Ms. Alickaj tried to reason with the men. **********''How can you do this?'' she asked. ''Don't you have sisters?'' **********One policeman retorted, ''I have sisters, but they don't want a republic.'' He was referring to some Kosovar Albanians' demands for independence. **********Ms. Alickaj and two others were menstruating, the young women said, and the police tried to force those who were not into another room. When they began to scream, the police relented, keeping the group together. Five of them were eventually ordered to leave. Ms. Alickaj was alone. ''We are letting the other girls go because you are the most beautiful,'' one of the policemen said. **********The officer, Ms. Alickaj said, then forced her to perform oral sex. ''I was lucky to not be raped in another way because I was having my period,'' she said. **********The group reunited the next day and left for Macedonia. **********As she told her story last week, Ms. Alickaj's face flashed anger, but she was composed and freely gave her name. Her female friends had discussed the attack without mentioning what happened to Ms. Alickaj, until she arrived and disclosed it herself. **********A male friend who knew of the attack angrily shooed away a middle-aged man and blurted out in English, ''He made her do oral sex,'' so his words would not be understood by Albanians nearby."

And such support, based on recent comments from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, does not seem likely, she said. **********In New York, the yen settled at 106.44 to the dollar, up from 108.81 on Friday. This was the strongest the yen has been since the spring of 1996. **********In other currency trading, the dollar was down slightly against the single European currency, which settled at $1.0411, up from $1.0364 on Friday. Setbacks in local elections for Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany knocked the euro lower earlier in the day, but it rebounded.  For the year, the euro is still down 10.8 percent. **********The rally of the yen has been fueled by the apparent turnaround of the Japanese economy after the longest recession since World War II. As foreign investors have gained confidence about the nation's economic outlook, they have bet that the Japanese stock market would go up. And to buy Japanese stocks, foreign investors have to buy yen, which is pushing its value higher. **********So far this year, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 29.4 percent in yen terms after a jump of 1.1 percent yesterday, to 17,909.29. **********The changing view of the Japanese economy has been supported by surprising growth figures for the first two quarters of this year. It became harder to dismiss as an aberration the annual growth rate of 8.1 percent in the first quarter after the second-quarter annual growth rate came in at an unexpected nine-tenths of a percent. **********But the rising yen also could pose a threat to the economic recovery. As the yen strengthens, it makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad. And these higher prices could cut into sales in this sector that is so important to the overall economy. **********The Japanese authorities have worried about this threat, which is why they tried to change the direction of the yen with six big interventions in June and July. But they appear to have given up that strategy, possibly because it is difficult for any government to stand against the movement of its currency if investors around the world are pushing it in one direction."

Several Turkish commentators said the trial could prove a crucial test of Turkey's much-criticized judicial system. **********Mr. Ocalan was captured late Monday night in Nairobi, Kenya, where he had been living clandestinely under the protection of Greek diplomats. Turkish commandos brought him to Turkey before dawn on Tuesday, and he has been taken to an island prison from which all other inmates are being evacuated. **********The Government's determination to continue pursuing Kurdish guerrillas was made clear today as an estimated 3,000 Turkish troops crossed into northern Iraq to attack what officers say are guerrilla sanctuaries. Turkish troops have carried out such operations regularly in recent years. **********In a televised interview, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit brushed aside concerns about Mr. Ocalan's trial, which is expected to focus on a few specific massacres that are said to have been perpetrated by his Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K. **********''It will be very free, a very just trial, because justice is very free in Turkey, autonomous,'' Mr. Ecevit said. ''It need not last too long because all the illegal actions, the crimes of the P.K.K.'s leadership, are well known.'' **********Asked about his Government's refusal to allow Mr. Ocalan's lawyers to enter the country, he replied: ''They want, more or less, to inspect the Turkish justice system, but they have no right to have any doubts about it. Also, the Turkish justice system has certain rules about who can defend.'' **********A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sermet Atacanli, later said Turkey would not allow foreign governments or organizations to send observers to Mr. Ocalan's trial. **********''It is not possible for us to accept actions from outside Turkey which might be an intervention in the Turkish judicial process,'' Mr. Atacanli said. ''Thus we could not accept such things as observers.'' **********Mr. Atacanli said the trial would be open to the public, but that ''if people who give themselves legal titles such as observers or lawyers come to Turkey to behave like an inspector, they will not be allowed to do that.'' **********The chief of Mr. Ocalan's legal team, Britte Boehler, a German who is based in the Netherlands, said after her failed attempt to enter Turkey that she feared Mr. Ocalan was being tortured. **********''We are telling Turkey we are on this case and we intend to stay on it,'' Ms. Boehler told reporters at the Amsterdam airport. She said the fact that she was not permitted to visit her client was ''a clear symbol of how the trial would be.'' **********Turkish newspapers today published new details about the commando operation. Many were contradictory, however. **********Some reported that Greek Embassy officials in Kenya knew they were sending Mr. Ocalan into a trap when they let him be taken to the Nairobi airport. Many said the Central Intelligence Agency had provided the first tip that Mr. Ocalan was in Kenya, and several said Israeli secret services had provided advice or other help. **********Turkey did not clear up the mystery. **********Turkish television stations today broadcast a video showing some aspects of the operation. In it, Mr. Ocalan is seen being led onto a small plane, handcuffed and blindfolded. After being handcuffed to a seat, his blindfold was removed, revealing his sweat-drenched face. **********In what seemed to be a bizarre comment from a figure who has portrayed himself as a fearless revolutionary, Mr. Ocalan is heard to tell his captors: ''If the truth needs to be told, I love Turkey and the Turkish nation, and I want to serve it. If I have the chance, I would be pleased to serve. Let there be no torture or anything. I would be happy to serve.'' **********Later Mr. Ocalan was shown being led to a bed, unsteady and apparently drowsy, as commandos gave each other high-five slaps and flashed the victory sign. **********Statements urging Turkey to guarantee Mr. Ocalan a fair trial came from many world capitals today. The British Government said it would urge that the trial be conducted ''in strict accordance with the rule of law and due process.'' **********In Geneva, the chief United Nations investigator for torture, Sir Nigel Rodley, said: ''Without in any way implying any conclusion as to the facts of the case, I appeal to the Turkish authorities for clarification of the circumstances with a view to insuring that Mr. Ocalan's right to physical and mental integrity is respected.'' **********Conflicting impulses seem to be raging in many Turkish hearts this week. Nowhere was the jumble of emotions more visible than among the mourners at Edirnekapi Sehitligi, an Istanbul cemetery where soldiers killed in the Kurdish war are buried. **********''I wish they would give him to us so we could torture and kill him,'' one mourner at the cemetery, Fatma Elkan, said as she wept at the grave of her son, who was killed in 1993. **********Another mourner, Kazim Kalyon, who also lost a son in the war, said, ''I predict that he will be sentenced to death but that the sentence will be commuted to life imprisonment. That might be even worse than dying.''"

Montenegro, with 600,000 people, and Serbia, with 10 million, are the last republics left in the Yugoslav federation, whose Serbian leaders have been deserted by Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia. **********Already Montenegro has developed its own airline and abolished visa requirements (which are still rigid in Serbia), and is talking about issuing passports and a new currency tied to the German mark. **********More telling yet, the Government has promised to arrest all indicted war criminals who set foot in Montenegro, including Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President and thus Montenegro's head of state. **********In many of its moves toward independence, Montenegro is taking a leaf from Slovenia in the north, which seceded in 1991 after its demands for more autonomy within Yugoslavia were rejected and its citizens voted for independence. **********Yugoslavia's wars of secession also started in Slovenia, which battled federal soldiers for 10 days before being allowed to leave the troubled federation. **********So Montenegrins, proud people who boast of never having been conquered by the Ottoman Turks or other occupying powers in the Balkans, are readying for battle, just in case. **********Some of the men who yearn to be the core of Montenegro's new army while away the hours in the Gaeta cafe in this mountain town, Montenegro's ancient capital, planning resistance as they swill beer. **********The young men, known as the Warriors, have crew cuts and wear gold earrings and black jeans. They say they train in the hills above the town three days a week with assault rifles supplied by their Government. **********The closest they have come to action was last month, when hundreds of Yugoslav troops loyal to President Milosevic surrounded a training camp on Mount Lovcen, at the edge of Cetinje, and beat and arrested Bogdan Bozidar, 44, the local militia leader. Angry villagers, many armed with hunting rifles, blocked the roads in a tense standoff with the soldiers until he was released. **********''The war almost began at that moment,'' said Zoran Gazivoda, 21, one of an estimated 2,000 militiamen. **********Since Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, broke with Mr. Milosevic two years ago, Serbia has waged a vitriolic campaign against him. After the 11-week NATO campaign, which largely spared Montenegro the bombardment rained on Serbia, the oratory seems to have reached new depths, with Serbian news media branding Montenegro's leaders ''lackeys of NATO.'' **********Serbia has refused to demobilize several thousand troops in Montenegro and is forming them into federal police units. Senior Government officials here say this new force will be used to seize the border crossings into Serbia, which are now controlled by the Montenegrins. **********And that could mean trouble, just as the Slovenes' seizure of their borders in 1991 started a mini-war. **********''We will arrest the first person who attempts to operate here in a federal police uniform,'' said Branko Perovic, the republic's foreign minister. ''We do not recognize federal authority.'' **********''Nothing has been the same after the air strikes,'' he said in an interview in his office in Podgorica, the capital. ''Our policy was to avoid conflict with the rest of the world, and because of this Montenegro was largely untouched during the bombing, although we lost a bridge in the north and about seven civilians were killed. Serbia, meanwhile, was totally devastated. We are now at zero and Serbia is at minus-40. Our priorities have become very different. Things are going now much faster than anyone expected.'' **********If the federal police do try to take over the border posts, they could be backed up by 10,000 Yugoslav soldiers still stationed in Montenegro, but it is not yet clear that it will come to a fight. **********[In Belgrade on Friday, the official news agency Tanjug announced that representatives of Mr. Milosevic's Socialist party and Mr. Djukanovic's party would meet next week to discuss Montenegro's demands. Mr. Milosevic's party has refused all contact on that score in the 13 months since Mr. Djukanovic's supporters triumphed in parliamentary elections in Montenegro.] **********In a May 26 ultimatum to Belgrade on independence, Montenegro called for the withdrawal of Yugoslav Army troops. But the army is flexing its muscles, setting up periodic roadblocks in an attempt to block shipments of goods into Montenegro because the republic's government -- again following the Slovene pattern -- is refusing to pay federal customs duties or taxes to Belgrade. **********In a gesture indicative of Montenegro's mood, the minister of tourism, Vladimir Mitrovic, says he has spoken to NATO officials about sending off-duty soldiers in Kosovo for holidays on the Montenegrin coast. **********''These soldiers are more than welcome as tourists,'' said Zarko Rakcevic, the president of the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro, one of three coalition partners in the government. ''But they shouldn't leave their weapons behind.'' **********It seems to be forgotten that at the start of the wars in the former Yugoslavia, many Montenegrins -- ethnically and culturally similar to the Serbs -- enthusiastically embraced Mr. Milosevic's calls for a Greater Serbia. In 1991 Serbian and Montengrin soldiers shelled Dubrovnik, on the Croatian coast, and took part in a frenzy of looting and murder in Croatia. Thousands of Montenegrins fought in Bosnia, whose Serbs were led in war by a native of Montenegro, Radovan Karadzic. **********But the Montenegrins, with the ashes of defeat in their mouths, dismiss their complicity in the destruction of Yugoslavia, portraying themselves as victims of aggression. **********''We live under Serb occupation,'' said Mr. Bozidar, a former professional handball player, who owns the Gaeta cafe. ''Every evil in the Balkans has come from the Serbs, and we want no part of them. They are genocidal cowards who have created a society devoid of all morality.'' **********Cetinje is the epicenter of Montenegrin nationalism and the physical embodiment of the new nationalist myth. It was the seat of the old Montenegrin kingdom, which was dismantled at the end of World War I when Montenegro became part of Yugoslavia. **********Cavernous old foreign embassies, including those that once belonged to the British, Russian, German, Italian and French, lie in decay in the city center around overgrown parks and huge, leafy plane trees. The imposing 15th-century Serbian Orthodox Church, with its gray stone walls and gold-leaf icons, is filled with the tombs of the old Montenegrin royalty. **********The gloomy royal palace, now a museum, is adorned with oil portraits of kings and queens who ruled Europe at the beginning of the century, and with heroic paintings of Montenegrin kings and princes. Its walls are decorated with ivory handled pistols, inlaid rifles, swords and ornate gold brocade uniforms. **********Tino Vujovic, a painter, climbed the stairs to his loft in the heart of the town and spoke excitedly about what he sees as coming independence. **********He accused the Serbs of ''stealing the language of the Montenegrins'' to create Serbian, of being of Turkish descent, even of lacking a civilization. ''Our language has four more letters than Serbian,'' he said. ''It is not the same. Everything about us is different. Serbs are scum.'' **********The split has sundered the Serbian Orthodox Church, the dominant religion in the republic. The monks and priests from Serbia live in the walled monastery on one side of Cetinje. The priests of Montenegrin descent are encamped in a rival church across town. The two factions heap abuse on their rivals and call for the liberation of their rival holy sites. **********''The hatred between the Serbs and Montenegrins is nothing compared to the hatred between the two religious orders,'' Mr. Bozidar said. ''Those priests don't even talk to each other anymore. They are really blood enemies.''"

The research is being done by Frank Boutsen, a professor of neurogenic speech disorders, and Christy Bager, a graduate student. **********Vibrato is produced by the vibration of a player's fingers as they press strings on the neck of a stringed instrument. Skilled violinists practice arm movements that make them more efficient, but the vibrato tone is shaped over time as students develop a feel for the movement. **********Violin students generally rely on sensations in the muscles and tendons of the arm to select and shape movements that produce better vibrato. To master the technique, teachers instruct students to mimic certain everyday motions -- like tipping a salt shaker or knocking on a door, Ms. Gaber explained. **********The new research is an effort to simplify that subjective process by using technology that demonstrates which muscle movements produce the cleanest sound, Dr. Boutsen said. ''This study really takes the subjectivity out of producing vibrato,'' he said. ''I think what it really does is help people find their range better, fine-tune probably with better precision.'' **********The research began last spring as an outgrowth of earlier studies by Dr. Boutsen on voice modulation and tremors. ''We were looking at vocal vibrato,'' Dr. Boutsen said, ''a modulation in a person's voice, when we said, Why don't we look at stringed instrument vibrato?'' **********The original subjects included two  violinists from the Tulsa Philharmonic and two inexperienced high school violinists. Monitoring muscle activity and muscle tone, Dr. Boutsen and Ms. Gaber placed surface electrodes over the violinists' vibrato-producing muscles as they played ''Amazing Grace.'' **********Ms. Gaber focused on a single note at the end of a phrase where musicians tend to incorporate vibrato. She noted the location of the muscle activity and compared it with the acoustic output. A modified version of Motor Speech Profiler software by Kay Elemetrics, which is used to study human voice patterns, was used to correlate muscle activity with the acoustic signals of each note. **********The conclusions confirmed the researchers' hypothesis that acoustic and muscle activity patterns were more consistent and efficient for advanced players. The rate of amplitude modulation -- the rate of the rapid changes in pitch that underlie vibrato -- during the violin vibrato of experienced violinists ranged from 4.78 to 5.71 hertz (cycles per second), which means that the modulation occurred about five times a second. With inexperienced violinists, the modulation rate was more erratic, from 5 to 9 times a second. **********The software also enables the violinists to view the results of their vibrato attempts as depictions of waves on a computer screen, and they can watch as changes in technique produce changes on the screen. **********The study could be ''instrumental in developing violin training software applications that can detect and analyze sounds,'' Ms. Gaber said. And while the software alone will not eliminate the need for a violin instructor, Ms. Gaber, a 13-year veteran of the violin, is confident that this kind of biofeedback may ease the difficulty of learning to produce a rich vibrato in the future."

They held his arms flat on a tree stump. And he felt the machete fall on one wrist, then on the other. **********''This,'' the rebels told him, ''is an example to show the President.'' **********Hacking off hands and feet of ordinary people has been a key weapon of a widespread campaign of terror and butchery waged by rebels trying to overthrow this ravaged country's President. In recent days, the fighting has reached the capital, marking another brutish turn in a civil war that has pushed Sierra Leone to the brink of disintegration. **********After nearly seizing Freetown, only to be pushed back by Nigerian-led forces last week, the rebels have retreated eastward into the surrounding mountains brandishing the threat of a future assault. As they fled, the rebels shot dead thousands of civilians, and mutilated hundreds of others. **********Over the weekend, scores of men, women and children, with hands chopped off or dangling limply from their forearms, have flooded the main medical center,  Connaught Hospital. A few days earlier, the hospital had received so many wounded and dead that bodies lying in the driveway had drawn dogs and vultures. By the weekend, hospital officials had recorded 2,768 dead in Freetown. **********''In my lifetime this is the worst I have ever seen,'' said Dr. Johnston Taylor, in the middle of surgery in a small, unlit operating room, the smell of sweat- and blood-soaked clothes clinging to the airless room. **********With Freetown under siege for two weeks, deserted by nearly all international humanitarian organizations, Dr. Taylor was performing surgery without anesthetic. His patient, a young man whose left leg had been shattered by a bullet, punctuated the surgeon's words with moans. **********''The last one was worst,'' the surgeon said, referring to the fighting last February when Nigerian-led forces had expelled the same rebels from Freetown. ''Now I don't know what adjective I should use to describe what is happening now. I don't know whether there is a better adjective to use than worst. It's, it's, I mean, it's unimaginable to see what we are doing to ourselves.'' **********On the day that a Nigerian soldier found Mr. Sesay slipping into unconsciousness on a street and brought him to Connaught, surgeons performed so many amputations that they tossed severed hands into a communal bucket. **********As his brother Ishmael carried a spoonful of milk to his lips, Mr. Sesay, 29, lay on his bed and recalled that he had fled his family house in eastern Freetown after rebels calling themselves Sergeant Burnhouse and Captain Blood burst inside and shot dead eight of his relatives. **********Like many other victims, Mr. Sesay knew the killers; they lived in his neighborhood and he and his brothers had even considered them friends. Like many other victims, he was told that they would keep him alive but turn him into a political message. **********Atop a mountain overlooking Freetown, inside a heavily guarded compound, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah had not descended yet into the city to see the bandaged stumps on Mr. Sesay's arms or other mutilated people, because of safety concerns, said his spokesman, Septimus Kaikai. Over two days, President Kabbah remained unavailable for comment. ''The President is resting,'' Mr. Kaikai told journalists visiting the compound. **********About the injured and the dead, Mr. Kaikai said: ''These are the things that happen as a result of war. If you go to Vietnam, there was a lot of carnage. If you go to Cambodia, there was a lot of carnage.'' **********In 1996, after years of civil war, Mr. Kabbah, a lawyer and former United Nations Development Program official, became this West African country's first democratically elected President, before being overthrown a year later by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and the Revolutionary United Front. **********With virtually no national army, Mr. Kabbah relied on a West African regional military force known as Ecomog, led by Nigeria, to regain power last March. Since then, the ousted rebels-- who are backed by neighboring Liberia, according to Washington and other Western governments -- have massacred villagers in eastern and northern Sierra Leone, even as they prepared another assault on Freetown. **********Although mass killings have occurred elsewhere in Africa, the rebels have distinguished themselves by not killing their victims, but by mutilating them and leaving them as living symbols of terror. Rebel leaders have denied the mutilations, accusing the Kamajors, an untrained, civilian defense force that includes many boys and is supporting the President. **********Last summer, the New York-based Human Rights Watch released a report concluding that the Kamajors had committed abuses, but that most of the atrocities up to then had been committed by the rebels. **********At Connaught Hospital, whose 212 beds make it Sierra Leone's biggest hospital, the survivors blamed the rebels. **********In Ward 2, Mohammed Sesay, a farmer who is not related to the other Sesay and did not know his own age, stood with his 2-year-old son, Osman, whose fractured head was bandaged like a bicycle helmet. A couple of weeks earlier, rebels had invaded the family's house outside Freetown. **********''They caught his mama and chopped, chopped her,'' Mr. Sesay said. ''Then they threw him inside the toilet.'' **********On Saturday, long lines of refugees streamed into central Freetown from the east. At Connaught Hospital, dilapidated two-story structure built in the 1920's by the British, the country's former colonial rulers, the most seriously injured were brought inside, past the main entrance where the motto of the English Order of the Garter could still be read on a faded coat-of-arms, ''Honi Soit Mal Qui Mal Y Pense'' -- ''Evil to Him Who Evil Thinks.'' **********Just inside the gates, amid scores of wounded waiting to be treated, Danka Koromoh stood, indomitable, over three of her daughters. Her 3-year-old was uninjured, but flies buzzed around the bloodied, bandage stump where 14-year-old Mariama's left hand used to be. Aissatou, 12, sat next to her mother's right leg, her two hands severed. **********Mrs. Koromoh said the rebels had also sliced off the hands of her 8-year-old daughter and had kidnapped the 13-year-old. **********''They killed my sister and my husband,'' she said. **********A few feet away, Lamine Jusugarka, 46 and father of six, sat slumped on the concrete ground, both hands gone. His niece, Isata Bangura, 15, whose parents had been killed two days earlier, fed him potato chips. His wife sat nearby, crying, her kneecaps smashed by a hammer-wielding rebel. **********The day before, recalled Mr. Jusugarka, a former security guard at Barclays bank, rebels invaded his neighborhood east of Freetown. Most were young men, or even boys, led by a rebel who called himself Mr. Junior. **********''He's a young man I can handle and deal with'' under normal circumstances, Mr. Jusugarka said. **********But the rebels, pointing guns, forced him and his neighbors under a mango tree. ''Because there was a root on where you could put your hands firmly,'' he recalled. ''Then he took a big ax and cut your hand instantly. Tell you to put another one. You put it. Cut it. We were 50 in number.'' **********''Oh I felt so bad,'' he said. ''I felt as if I am finishing the world. My eyes were dark. My blood was pumping as if they had opened a tank, a water tank to run. Oh I fell down. I could not see my way.'' **********''We were in the line. One after another. You go next. When they finished with you, when they cut your two hands, you run. They say, 'Move! If you don't move, we'll fire on you.' Fifty on that particular day.''"

But Mr. Bonsignore, a handsome six-footer who at age 58 looks the part of a movieland chief executive, sees the attention as a bonus that he has earned. **********''Maybe one day I'll have my grandchild make a scrapbook of all the stuff,'' he said.

Having lived in 12 states and 6 countries, Mr. Bonsignore, who speaks three foreign languages, is as comfortable sending the Honeywell board to Russia to attend the Bolshoi Ballet with the Minister of Culture as he is boating with local friends. **********''He's the only person I know who doesn't get jet-lagged,'' said E. D. Grayson, Honeywell's general council and a frequent -- and often exhausted -- travel companion of Mr. Bonsignore. **********Mr. Bonsignore met his wife, Sheila, the child of another nomadic American family, when they were teen-agers in Venezuela. Both take moving  in their stride; the East Coast is farther from their two grown children in California, but near Michael, the son and professional actor who is currently appearing in ''Angels Fall,'' Off Broadway. ''We're gypsies by nature, and Sheila is head-over-heels crazy about New York,'' he said. **********New York -- or, specifically, Wall Street -- has been pretty crazy about Honeywell of late. Its stock had hit $95 even before word of the impending merger sent it on a weeklong rise that had it closing at $113 on Friday. **********But when Mike Bonsignore, who joined Honeywell in 1969, became its chief in 1993, Honeywell's sales were mired at $6 billion and its stock price sat in the $20's. **********Mr. Bonsignore is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and thus, by his own description, is a trained leader. He introduced benchmarking, performance-based pay and a sell-solutions-not-widgets marketing approach. He insisted that managers set high goals; those that met them were rewarded, those that did not were out. He got Honeywell managers and engineers, formerly rather secretive, talking to one another, and to him. **********''What strikes you immediately is his openness and candor and how easy he makes it for people to disagree with him,'' Mr. Grayson said. **********Like Lawrence A. Bossidy, the chief executive of Allied, and John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chief and Mr. Bossidy's former boss, Mr. Bonsignore was brought up a strict Catholic. ''You can't say we  have a Catholic chemistry, but we're products of that upbringing, strict men of our word,'' said Mr. Bonsignore, who went to parochial school and still spends many Sundays at church. **********At Mr. Bonsignore's insistence, Honeywell has been a major contributor to causes as varied as low-income housing and local theaters in Minneapolis. He just received an award from the College of St. Benedict near Minneapolis for his leadership in transforming some of the city's  poorer neighborhoods. **********Although he has pledged to continue Honeywell's local philanthropy, the city's officials say it won't be the same. ''Michael is hands-on,'' said Sharon Sayles Belton, Mayor of Minneapolis. ''He doesn't send delegates to meetings; he shows up himself.'' **********Local businessmen may miss him, too. ''He's a better diplomat than I am -- he knows when to bite his tongue -- but he is unerring in his ability to keep meetings focused on the issues,'' said William W. George,  chairman of Medtronic, who has been a friend of Mr. Bonsignore for 12 years and invited him onto Medtronic's board last year. **********Mr. Bonsignore's charity travels with him. Last year, when a grade school he was visiting in China struck him as cold and damp, he arranged for Honeywell to provide heaters and floor mats. **********Travels to Honeywell outposts often highlighted the celebrity he achieved among his own employees. ''He was like the Pied Piper,'' recalled James T. Porter, Honeywell's chief administrative officer. ''He'd walk in, and immediately there's this buzz, 'Mike's here, I've gotta see him, say hello.' And these huge throngs of people would just follow him down the halls.'' **********Mr. Bonsignore concedes that his familial style may at first confuse Allied employees, who are used to the more aloof manner of Mr. Bossidy, who retires in April. ''I'm more approachable than Larry, and I probably delegate more,'' he  said. ''But don't mistake that for lack of resolve. A C.E.O. must be a coach and adviser, but also a taskmaster.'' **********Suggest to those who know Mr. Bonsignore that he might be, well, just a bit too soft, and they tell of the 20 vice presidents he dismissed soon after he was made chief and of the lax performers he has pushed out since then. **********''Allied people keep calling, asking what he's like,'' said Mr. Porter, who will stay with the merged company. ''I tell them, he'll insist you call him Mike, he'll be communicative and warm. But, I also tell them how tough he is. If someone isn't performing well, he'll take them out.''"

And Then Billions,CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: NEWS ANALYSIS; Surprise on Capitol Hill: No! And Then Billions," **********For Congress, or even one house of Congress, to refuse to endorse current combat missions is about as unusual as Congress's keeping pork out of an urgent spending bill. **********But the House is taking the first of those untrodden paths even as it takes its customary route on the second. On Wednesday night it voted not to endorse the bombing of Yugoslavia. **********Today its Appropriations Committee voted to spend more than twice what the Administration sought for the campaign and another billion or so for other neat stuff like base construction. **********In the short run, the contradiction may not matter much. But who knows if this war is a short-run conflict? And if it is not, the deep partisan division raises embarrassing warnings for the Clinton Administration. **********Ever since it took office, the Administration has paid more attention to the Senate than the House, and hardly any to individual House Republicans. From 1995 through early 1998, President Clinton could occasionally deal with Speaker Newt Gingrich. **********But the White House approach was generally to count on the Senate to clean up any mess the House made. And the Senate, where most members can visualize themselves in the Oval Office, is inclined to see virtue in a powerful Presidency, especially for foreign affairs. **********That pattern has persisted. Mr. Clinton has talked to Congressional leaders about Yugoslavia, but not to the rank and file. And the White House, concentrating on the other votes on the Wednesday schedule -- a bid to withdraw and a demand for consultation before ground troops might be used -- was caught napping on the bombing vote. **********But that is not the only factor. Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, as majority whip the President's most powerful enemy in Congress, was doing his utmost to turn votes against the bombing, while Speaker J. Dennis Hastert sat quietly, not even casting his ''aye'' vote early to give a signal of his support for it. **********Representative Mary Bono, Republican of California, said that after she had voted to endorse the bombing Mr. DeLay had come up to her and asked: '' 'Are you sure of this vote? Are you really convicted, because we really need a ''no.'' ' '' **********She said that she rejected his plea and that he went away, but that she changed her vote to no after talking to others. **********Mr. DeLay issued a statement today saying that it was 26 Democratic defections, not his lobbying, that defeated the measure on a tie, 213 to 213. He called it a Democratic miscalculation. **********An aide, Mike Scanlon, said: ''We talked to members on the floor. We didn't twist any arms. We didn't break any knuckles.'' **********He had a point when he accused Democrats of being overconfident.  After 92 Republicans had voted earlier against compelling a withdrawal of troops under the War Powers Resolution, Democrats assumed that most would consider it logical to endorse the bombing. But 61 of them switched, leaving only 31 Republicans behind the President on the final vote. **********The White House seized on the contradictions. Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, termed the results ''a muddle.'' He said: ''They did not want to move forward with ground troops. They voted against withdrawing and were deadlocked on the merits of the air campaign. The only thing they seem to agree on is that they want to double the amount of money we should spend on this policy that they can't agree on.'' **********But Republicans interpreted their votes differently. Dick Armey, the majority leader, said in an interview, ''I did not want to give them an after-the-fact blessing.'' He said the day's important message was the demand, which passed, that Mr. Clinton consult before using ground troops. **********Mr. Hastert said in another interview, ''We didn't whip anybody.'' He  faulted Mr. Clinton for having ignored his advice to come and talk to House members. **********Mr. DeLay told the House not to ''take ownership'' of the war by supporting it. He was telling Republicans to let the President keep the inevitable blame for himself. **********Just as it is unusual for members of Congress not to do the safe thing and vote in favor of a war that has already started (even while complaining about it), it is almost unheard of for Republicans to invoke the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which passed despite them and over President Richard M. Nixon's veto. **********But the vote to demand a withdrawal of United States forces from the war in 30 days rested on that act.  Although it was defeated, 290 to 139, Republicans backed it, 127 to 92. **********Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, has accused many in his party of creeping isolationism. Today he called the invocation of the War Powers Resolution ''legislation the Republicans have always despised, in order to cut off a military action that is under way and upon whose success American credibility depends, is really appalling, really irresponsible.'' **********This Administration, like its predecessors, regards the resolution as unconstitutional. As the appropriations vote today shows, there is not the faintest inclination to halt financing of the war, an undoubted Congressional power. **********But House opposition can spread to the Senate. An unwilling Congress dealing with war cannot make it easier. Especially if the public continues to share what Representative David Dreier, chairman of the Rules Committee, today called ''the same kind of confusion that exists in the Balkans, that exists in the White House, that exists in the Congress.''"

Among the beneficiaries of their largess are some of the nation's most exclusive colleges, universities and prep schools. **********The partners have been restricted from selling the shares they received when Goldman raised $3.66 billion through its initial public offering in May. But the firm waived those restrictions last month to allow the partners to donate stock to organizations, which can then turn around and sell the shares. **********The bulk of the eight million shares they plan to give away -- worth about $640 million -- will go into private foundations set up by individual partners, according to a Goldman filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. About half of the remainder will go to the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, which lets donors make contributions and decide later how the assets will be distributed. **********Among the recipients that were named are well-known charities like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (19,614 shares) and the Salvation Army (9,153). **********Of course, the Ivy League is well represented -- by, among others, Harvard (27,460 shares), Yale (18,961), Cornell (26,152) and the University of Pennsylvania (15,037).

In return, he said, Allianz, which is based in Munich, gets a highly rated fund manager to help it get business in the European pension markets. **********Pimco is also a stock fund manager, and in 1997 it acquired Oppenheimer Capital L.P. But it is best known for its bond funds and its top portfolio manager, William H. Gross. The ownership units in Pimco Advisors Holdings represent a 44 percent stake in Pimco Advisors, whose largest shareholder is the Pacific Life Insurance Company. Pimco Advisors manages about $250 billion. **********Because of the takeover speculation, Pimco has been one of the few publicly traded companies to avoid the summer's downdraft in shares of asset managers. Pimco's units have returned 11.3 percent so far this year, including a 7.3 percent yield, while shares of other large fund managers have declined amid concerns that the industry is rapidly maturing, and that new-cash flows are unlikely to return to the high levels of 1997 anytime soon. **********Pimco is one of only a few fund families that has managed to attract large sums from investors this year."

From that springboard, she travelled to dozens of countries as an advocate for women's and Indian causes. **********Terence Freitas, 24, a California native who had recently moved to Brooklyn, had spent much of the last three years trying to focus attention on the Uwa tribe's battle to preserve its land from oil exploration. The Uwa ''considered him one of theirs,'' a friend said. **********Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii, chairwoman of the Pacific Cultural Conservancy International, worked to bring educational opportunities to indigenous people and recognition for her own Polynesian culture. To shed light on that culture, she was writing a book about her own roots in Hawaiian royalty. **********''These people are so committed and courageous,'' said Laurie Parise, executive director of the Rainforest Foundation U.S., a 10-year-old organization in New York City, who knew two of the slain Americans. ''They knew the danger, but they still went down there.'' **********Ms. Washinawatok grew up on the Menominee Reservation, where a tribal spiritual leader gave her the name Peqtaw Metamoh when she was a child. It means Thunderbird Woman. **********''Her whole life was about humanity, about respecting people's ability to be who they are,'' said Apesanahkwat, the chairman of the Menominee Nation. **********''She was just a wonderful person, a mom and a sister and a daughter, an Indian woman who epitomizes all those values that not many people possess,'' he added. **********Ms. Washinawatok was a co-chairwoman of the Indigenous Women's Network and was active in forums sponsored by the United Nations and other international groups on Indian and women's rights issues. Since 1992, she was also a member of the the board of directors of the American Indian Community House in Manhattan. **********She worked for the Fund of the Four Directions in Manhattan, a foundation that supports Native American culture. **********Ms. Washinawatok's advocacy work began early. At age 14, she helped her father, James, organize on the reservation, and three years later came to New York City as an intern with the International Treaty Council, which monitored Indian rights in the hemisphere. **********Ali el Issa, her husband of 16 years and a former Rite Aid drug store manager, said he last spoke with his wife a week before she was kidnapped. ''I told her, if it's not safe, come back. Don't use your sympathy, use your brain.'' Mr. el Issa said she responded, ''I feel I am with my people, like I'm back on the reservation.'' **********The couple has a son, Maehki, who is 14. **********Mr. Freitas, a graduate of the University of California at Santa Cruz, was trained as an environmental biologist and worked in various environmental law projects after college. His passion was not for books and formulas, though. It was for the wild, said Leslie Wirpsa, a close friend. **********''It was his natural habitat to be out in the woods,'' she said, adding, ''His spirit is inextricably linked to the land.'' **********Mr. Freitas had been involved with the Uwa fight to keep oil companies from drilling on their land for nearly three years and founded a group called the Uwa Defense Working Group, which he said was dedicated to the principle of non-violent social change. **********He helped bring an Uwa tribal leader to California last year for public debates with spokesmen for the Occidental Gas and Oil Corporation, the Bakersfield, Calif., company whose affiliate, Occidental de Colombia, has been trying to explore for oil on and near the Uwa lands. **********''The Uwa considered him one of theirs,'' Ms. Wirpsa said. The feeling was mutual. ''He was awestruck when he was in the Uwa territory,'' she added. ''I remember when he showed us a slide -- red birds against a rich verdant green backdrop -- and you could feel his heart jump when he showed that slide.'' **********Melina Selverston, director of the Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and their Environment, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, said Mr. Freitas had received death threats on his telephone answering machine. She said they came from the right-wing paramilitary groups that operate in the Arauca area of Colombia where the Americans were abducted. **********''Terence was a deeply deeply committed young man,'' Ms. Selverston added. ''He was the one person the Uwa trusted as a connection to the outside world.'' **********Ms. Gay, 39, was a native Hawaiian of Scottish, Mohawk and French descent, with varied interests and talents. A photojournalist and writer, she led delegations of indigenous Polynesians to various international forums and was active in Hawaii in fighting for their official recognition. **********''Her work was her passion,'' John Livingstone, who described himself as Ms. Gay's common-law husband, said in a telephone interview from his parents' home in Connecticut. ''She dedicated her life to indigenous causes and saving traditional cultures.'' **********Hawaiian elders had trained her in what Mr. Livingstone called traditional anthropology, and she was using those skills to trace the history of the royal family from which she was descended.She was writing a book about her roots called The Ancestral Voices. **********Mr. Livingston said that Ms. Gay understood the dangers of a trip to the Uwa in Colombia, where she was exploring the possibility of setting up an education program modeled on one she had established in Panama. **********''They took my heart,'' Mr. Livingstone said, sobbing. ''She was the love of my life. She was just a phenomenal, beautiful person, and it was a senseless brutal act.''"

But the Rev. Sun Myung Moon envisions this remote and sparsely populated corner of Brazil as what he calls ''a kingdom of heaven on earth, a new Garden of Eden.'' **********Mr. Moon, the 78-year-old founder of the Unification Church, who has been rebuffed in the United States and is facing financial trouble in his native South Korea, is seeking to reinvent himself here in the South American heartland. **********Through a venture he calls New Hope East Garden, Mr. Moon has bought thousands of acres of pasture land and spent some $30 million, according to the project's manager, in hope of building a spiritual and business empire here that is to include investments in agriculture, industry and tourism, as well as a university. **********Such investment was at first welcomed in the neediest part of Mato Grosso do Sul, a state whose own governor describes it as a land of ''2 million people and 22 million cows.'' But increasingly, Mr. Moon's visible presence here is generating the same sort of opposition and suspicion that has followed him elsewhere around the world during a long career as the self-proclaimed ''true father'' and successor to Jesus Christ. **********''No one knows what he's up to out there, what are the objectives of his investments or the origins of his money,'' the governor, Jose Orcirio Miranda dos Santos, said in an interview. ''This has become an issue of national security, and I think an investigation is needed.'' **********Mr. Moon's initial warm reception has quickly chilled, with charges in the news media and from local church officials that the sect is involved in illegal activities. In October, local Roman Catholic and Protestant churches jointly issued an open letter accusing Mr. Moon of 10 forms of heresy, urging ''the people of God to keep their distance from the Unification sect.'' **********''More than a sect, this is a business that hides behind the facade of religion in order to make money,'' said Msgr. Vitorio Pavanello, the Roman Catholic bishop of Campo Grande, the state capital. ''He is trying to build an empire by buying everything in sight.'' **********But Mr. Moon's associates offer a different explanation. ''It is our goal and desire to do something great for this region,'' said Cesar Zaduski, a former president of the Unification Church in Brazil and the general manager of the New Hope project. ''Rev. Moon has a lot of companies around the world, more than 300, and his intention is to bring some of them here so that this region can get the benefit of development and first world know-how and technology.'' **********Mr. Zaduski said that Mr. Moon was prepared to commit much more money to make the New Hope venture viable. The objective, he said, is to produce fish, exotic meats, fruit and wood for commercial markets here and abroad, and to turn this area into a leading eco-tourism center within a few years. **********Mr. Moon's representatives here said that their leader first visited the region five years ago on a fishing trip and was impressed by its wide-open spaces and variety of wildlife. Since then, his movement has bought 220 square miles of farmland in Mato Grosso do Sul and a 310-square-mile parcel near Fuerte Olimpo on the Paraguayan side of the border, as well as hotels and other businesses. **********Mr. Moon's big push in this largely undeveloped corner of Brazil comes as the business conglomerate he controls in South Korea has nearly collapsed. Because of the economic crisis that swept across East Asia beginning in 1996, the debt of his Tong Il Group soared to more than $1.2 billion. Five of its 17 companies were forced into receivership last year, and an automobile manufacturing project in China has also failed. **********His diverse enterprises in the United States appear to be in better shape. Those include a newspaper, The Washington Times, as well as Bridgeport University in Connecticut, a recording studio and travel agency in New York, and a cable network, the Nostalgia Channel. But Mr. Moon has indicated recently that he is disenchanted with the country that has been his main base of operations since the 1970's. **********''America doesn't have anywhere to go now,'' he said in a speech in New York last year. ''The country that represents Satan's harvest is America, the kingdom of extreme individuality, of free sex.'' **********Mr. Moon's critics say that his view is growing harsher because of the decline of his influence in the United States, where he was imprisoned for a year after being convicted of tax evasion in 1982, and where he has been the subject of embarrassing books and news reports. **********While he was once believed to have about 30,000 followers in the United States, the current number of church members is believed to be about one-tenth that number. **********But Mr. Zaduski said Mr. Moon's interest in South America resulted from a desire to focus on the Roman Catholic world, after emerging from a Confucian and Buddhist environment and spending a long time in a predominantly Protestant atmosphere. No place, he added, has a larger concentration of Roman Catholics than South America, in particular in the region of the customs union called Mercosur, which consists of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Chile. **********''What unites South America is Mercosur, and what is the heart of Mercosur?'' he asked. ''This region here, where you can build a project that goes beyond borders.'' **********In recent years, Mr. Moon has been active in Uruguay, Brazil's southern neighbor -- so much so that the capital, Montevideo, is now derisively called Moontevideo by some.  There, the sect has acquired the luxury Victoria Plaza Hotel, operates the newspaper Tiempos del Mundo and retains an interest in a bank, Banco de Credito, in which the government intervened last year after complaints of irregularities. **********Here, Mr. Moon built up good will early on by donating ambulances to mayors, sponsoring barbecues for residents and making donations to political campaigns. He also opened a school on his New Hope property, invited local children to enroll and even offered to provide transportation from their homes. But relations are now openly hostile. **********''When they first began acquiring property here, we expected that they would promote and contribute to the prosperity of our region by generating jobs and taxes,'' said Marcio Campos Monteiro, the mayor of Jardim, a town of 21,000 people. ''But all they seem to be doing is stockpiling land, without producing anything or hiring from the local labor force.'' **********Mr. Monteiro contends that Mr. Moon's presence here has actually hurt the economy. The sect now owns 10 percent of the county, he said, and government revenues have dropped because he has withdrawn so much land from production and the tax rolls, claiming a religious exemption. **********The New Hope site includes at least 20 buildings, but has less than 200 permanent residents and many of those who work there are Korean, Japanese, American and European volunteers who rarely leave the compound and come for 40-day courses of instruction, paying their own way as well as making donations. **********Civic and church groups have also begun to complain loudly, and have even charged that local youths are being recruited and sent off for indoctrination in Sao Paulo, where the sect has its Brazilian headquarters. Though local police declined to discuss the matter, there are also complaints that converts are being held against their will at New Hope. **********''I recently had two young people who had run away from New Hope come in here seeking help in getting back home to Pernambuco,'' 1,500 miles away, said Bruno Padron, the Roman Catholic bishop here. ''They focus on the poor and the needy, and once they have them in their family, they refuse to let them go.'' **********Recent reports in the Brazilian news media have also suggested that the sect may be involved in drug trafficking and other forms of contraband smuggling across the notoriously porous border with Paraguay in order to generate revenues. **********Mr. Miranda dos Santos would say only that ''the federal government is looking into those questions.'' **********Mr. Zaduski dismissed such accusations as ''crazy stories'' and illogical. ''Rev. Moon comes here quite often, so if his people were doing something illegal, he would not want to be so close,'' he said. ''That would be stupid, because he is a big target.'' **********Despite the increasingly tense atmosphere here, Mr. Moon apparently plans to plunge ahead. In September, the government extended Mr. Moon's visa for two more years. **********''He is really amazed by the way nature here is so pristine,'' Mr. Zaduski said. ''He wants the entire world to understand that the heavenly father wants this treasure to be kept for all mankind, and that is why he is putting so much of his own time and guidance into this.''"

Soon, members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and other like-minded investors will be able to put their money where their mouths are. **********On June 1, State Street Global Advisors will introduce I.A.M. Shares, a mutual fund that will invest primarily in companies that employ the I.A.M.'s half-million members. While there are other labor-friendly mutual funds, I.A.M. Shares may be the first to focus on companies related to a single union, fund experts say. **********The union designed the fund as a way for its members to diversify their holdings and to earn a good return, although it will be open to the public as well. But the union also sees it as a way to increase its leverage with management. **********For example, about 25 percent of the 200,000 workers at Boeing are I.A.M. members. R. Thomas Buffenbarger, the president of the I.A.M., would like Boeing to give the union a seat on its board. ''If I just ask for it, why should they give it to me?'' he said in a recent interview. ''But if I show them that we are significant shareholders in the company, I will have a stronger case.'' **********First, however, he must persuade I.A.M. members and other investors that the fund will do as well or better than the overall stock market. **********STEPHEN SLEIGH, a top I.A.M. strategist, came up with the idea of I.A.M. Shares four years ago, but even he had doubts. To test its plausibility, he created a ''fantasy index'' that included 40 companies with I.A.M. contracts, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Harley Davidson and Northwest Airlines. Mr. Sleigh was surprised to see that it outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********After selling Mr. Buffenbarger on the idea, Mr. Sleigh approached State Street Bank, which has acted as trustee for the I.A.M.'s pension fund for decades. He gave State Street a list of 360 public companies that employ I.A.M. workers. State Street winnowed the list to the 250 most promising stocks and back-tested their performance. **********State Street would not disclose precise returns, but the results were encouraging. Although the portfolio lagged behind the S.& P. 500 over a five-year period, it outperformed the index over 10 years. **********''When I did it, it was easy for people to say, 'Steve is cooking the numbers,' '' Mr. Sleigh said. ''But when State Street did it, it really opened people's eyes.'' **********Gus Fish, a principal at State Street, was also surprised by the fund's pro forma record. ''We can run a portfolio that we think is fairly attractive,'' he said. **********Institutional investors that manage I.A.M. pension funds have committed about $60 million to the new fund. Mr. Fish said he expected it to grow to about $100 million by the end of June, adding that it could reach $500 million in two or three years. **********At that size, I.A.M. Shares would not yet be a threat to Fidelity Investments, but that is not the goal. The minimum investment has been set high, at $10,000, to discourage small investors and thereby to save on expenses. But the minimum will be waived for workers at companies that employ I.A.M. members. **********THE union will push hard to persuade I.A.M. companies to offer the fund though their 401(k)'s. ''A little over half of the members have 401(k) plans, but in our analysis too much of their savings are put into company stock,'' Mr. Sleigh said. ''We hope that this will be a savings plan that our members can take advantage of to really diversify their investments.'' **********The fund's total expenses will be 0.65 percent of it assets, less than half the industry average for United States diversified stock funds. State  Street will keep costs low by managing the fund using computer models, which is the company's specialty.  Mr. Sleigh's list of companies has been narrowed to about 230, using quantitative screens for numbers like expected earnings growth, price-to-earnings ratios and yield. The three largest holdings will be General Electric, Boeing and UAL, parent of United Airlines. The weightings will be reviewed quarterly. **********But in order to insure diversification, State Street and the union have agreed that as much as one-third of the fund can be in companies without I.A.M. contracts; that will allow for holdings in sectors like financial services, pharmaceuticals and high technology that have scant union representation. But the I.A.M. will be able to exclude any company it considers anti-labor. **********Since I.A.M. Shares was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, other unions have expressed interest in starting similar funds. But it is not clear how easy that would be. Because I.A.M. workers are employed by a wide variety of businesses -- including newspapers, airlines, automobile and aerospace manufacturers and paper companies -- State Street could create a fund that was broadly diversified. The sheet-metal workers might have a harder time. **********In the meantime, Mr. Buffenbarger, the I.A.M president, is so excited about the fund that he is thinking of investing some of his own savings in it, even though he would have to meet the $10,000 minimum because he does not work for an I.A.M. company. ''If I can talk my wife into it,'' he said, ''we will take some of the kids' college funds and do it, because I think it is a good thing.''"

As he watched, ugly cracks coursed across the facade, then half of it collapsed with a crash. **********''We have to recognize that many of the buildings worst hit by the quake were churches,'' the friar, the Rev. Benjamin Balcazar Rodriguez, said sadly today as he carried cardboard boxes filled with dusty vestments and figurines of saints from the rubble-strewn church. ''Considering how much evil there is in the world these days, I have to think this is God calling us to pay more attention to His holy places.'' **********The earthquake, which struck central Mexico at 3:42 P.M. on Tuesday, took many fewer lives than many people who felt its rocking punch -- a magnitude of 6.7 on the standard seismic scale -- thought it would. By the latest official count, 16 people perished under falling roofs and walls, and dozens were injured. **********But since the quake struck the same part of the country that lived through the hugely destructive Mexico City earthquake of 1985, this one had a powerful psychological impact, reawakening fears Mexicans had put to rest. **********To add to the sense of loss, some of this quake's most conspicuous victims were churches. At least 32, including several much-visited Spanish colonial gems, were hurt in Puebla state, on one side of the epicenter. For many Mexicans, with their strong Roman Catholic faith, relief that the death toll is not higher is mixed with sadness for the damage to their shrines. **********Cholula, with only 10,000 inhabitants, is believed to have more Catholic churches than any other small town in Mexico, some 70 in all. And Friar Balcazar's mustard-colored church, with its mighty wooden portal and white stucco columns, is the most renowned. Spanish missionaries, eager to show their spiritual superiority, erected it in 1594 at the very top of a 200-foot-high ancient pyramid, the largest one built by Mexico's pre-Columbian ancestors. **********Descendants of both Spaniards and Indians have flocked to the church because it is the home of Our Lady of Healing, an image of Mary that has been credited with curing all manner of illnesses and lending a hand with seemingly insoluble personal problems as well. **********When the quake struck, a few people were tending a store for tourists at one side of the church. The adobe ceiling crumbled around them but everyone got out without injury. A statue of Saint Francis, for whom the church is named, keeled to one side in its niche high above the altar but did not fall out. **********To the 51-year-old caretaker, Pedro Tenahua, it was no accident that the church's most sacred figures were spared. ''After all, this is God's sacred place,'' he said. **********But both side wings were battered beyond repair and the church has been closed indefinitely. **********Worried followers of Our Lady of Healing gathered at the base of the pyramid. One pilgrim who had made a daylong journey to come to pray that his wife's injured back be healed was deeply distressed to learn that he could not enter the church. **********''Why the churches? Why the churches?'' Cristina Toxqui, 38, another worshiper, fretted out loud. ''People don't respect each other anymore. This is a warning from God that we need to treat each other better as human beings.'' **********Elsewhere in town, fissures split the facade of the church of San Andres de Cholula, whose construction was completed in 1730, and the glorious yellow-tiled dome plunged to the ground. Julia Moreno Rodriguez, 75, was in the back praying when the dome thundered and fell. **********''I just sat where I was,'' Mrs. Moreno said. ''I said, if God wants me to die today, I would like it to happen in his temple.'' She was not hurt. **********In Puebla, a city of 1.2 million 60 miles east of Mexico City, whose impeccably preserved colonial center is a United Nations World Heritage Site that draws a flow of tourists, the church of Saint Augustine also lost its dome. At least nine other churches were among the 80 public buildings damaged in the city. **********Walls collapsed inside the colonial-era City Hall, and at least 120 other buildings in the city were destroyed. **********Javier Pacheco, the director of Mexico's National Seismological Service, said the earthquake did not inflict more damage because the soil of Puebla is rockier than the loamy former lake bed underneath Mexico City. Also, the epicenter was deep underground, and the duration was relatively brief, not more than 10 seconds. **********In Mexico City, two people died of heart failure brought on by the shaking, but material damage was slight. **********Still, with so many residents consumed with anxiety after reliving the terror of 1985, President Ernesto Zedillo continued today to oversee the reconstruction effort personally. He declared Puebla state a disaster area. **********The Rev. Emigdio Palacios, the parish priest of the church of San Andres de Cholula, said he was certain that the dome would be rebuilt. **********As he gazed up through the yawning hole in the arched roof, he said philosophically, ''This is one way for us to lift our eyes to Heaven.''"

In private conversations most Arab officials do not disguise their hope that his tenure may come to an end. **********But the attacks against him that are a usual staple of the Arab press have been muffled lately, apparently out of an aversion to handing Mr. Netanyahu anything he might use as ammunition. **********''He likes to be seen as standing tough against the Arabs, so the last thing we want to do is to reinforce that view,'' a Jordanian official said. **********The result has been an odd period of politesse. In the past Mr. Netanyahu has routinely been vilified in the Arab press with titles like ''Netanyahu, enemy of peace.'' Suddenly, even in newspapers that have been among his fiercest critics, he is ''Mr. Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister.'' **********Even Mr. Netanyahu's attempt this week to shut down Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem was described in an editorial in The Jordan Times as an ''election gimmick,'' even though similar attempts have prompted cries of condemnation. **********Still, with Mr. Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party, now leading in opinion polls before the voting on Monday, a faint sense of excitement can be felt among Arab officials and commentators who have begun to suggest that the election may well prove to be a watershed that will give way to broader peace. **********While governments are feigning neutrality, a Jordanian columnist, Fahed Fanek, wrote recently in the newspaper Al Rai that only the ''mentally lazy'' would say there was no difference between Labor and Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party. **********''Arabs will interpret the result as whether the Jewish state wants peace or not,'' wrote Mr. Fanek, who remained careful not to state a preference of his own. **********A television program in Egypt last week stoked the sense of hopefulness, with Mr. Netanyahu's opponents emphasizing their determination to reinvigorate the quest for peace. Yossi Beilin, a top adviser to Mr. Barak, said on the broadcast that the Labor Party leader was determined to make peace with all of the Arabs within a year, while Yitzhak Mordechai, the third main candidate, said he had left Likud in part because he wanted ''to develop cooperation with neighbors of Israel.'' **********Still, the tone of coverage here and across the Arab world has remained mild. Likud representatives were invited to appear on the Egyptian broadcast but declined. **********And with most election news relegated to the inside pages, some commentators have accused governments of being too cautious, saying it is important to drive home to Israelis the message of just how much is at stake. **********Instead, Arab countries seem determined to win ''an American certificate of good manners,'' a commentator, Abdel Wahab Badran, wrote recently in the London-based Arabic newspaper Al Hayat. **********In steering around the question of what candidate they prefer, those Arab leaders who have addressed the issue have tried to turn the focus on what may lie beyond the election. **********King Abdullah of Jordan, the new leader of a country whose peace with Israel remains unpopular among its citizens, called last week for the next Israeli government to show ''a sense of urgency'' in tackling stalled peace talks with the Palestinians. **********''If we are going to move forward -- the Israelis and the Palestinians -- I think it will have a cascade effect throughout the Middle East,'' the King told reporters in Amman. **********At the same time, though, most Arab commentators are counseling against the belief that a new day may be at hand. Not only might Mr. Netanyahu hold on to power, they say, but Mr. Barak, if elected, might prove an equally tough adversary. **********Some Arabs ''expect miracles from Barak, as if he is the savior of peace process, and that is mere imagination based on unrealistic wishes,'' Mr. Badran wrote in Al Hayat. **********He reminded readers that current peace agreements would remain the same whether under Labor or Likud rule. **********''It is the same peace,'' Mr. Badran wrote, ''but with Labor it smells better!''"

In reality, though, rather like a digital Braveheart, he is very much part of his country's updated assault on the electronic barricades. **********Since late last year, behind the imposing Gothic ramparts of Glasgow's Strathclyde University, Dr. Dunlop, 55, a professor of electronic systems engineering, has been working on a project to monitor incoming radio signals so efficiently that as they begin to weaken, they can be bolstered back to full audibility. **********What lifted this modest, $100,000 venture out of the groves of academe was that it was conducted in conjunction with the local subsidiary of Motorola. And its intention was far from theoretical: as Europe prepares to embrace a new generation of mobile phones, the technology developed by Dr. Dunlop and his small team will, he said, eliminate the fade-outs that are among the biggest irritants of wireless telephony. That could give Motorola a potential edge over competitors if the company chooses to exercise its first option on licensing rights. **********The notion of collaboration between university researchers and corporate partners is nothing new in the United States, or in parts of England to the south. But here, it is new and heretical -- and central to a major effort to break away from dependence on imported technology as a source of manufacturing employment, or ''screwdriver'' jobs, and burst into an era of innovation generated at home. **********Increasingly, its proponents say, that shift is the cornerstone of Scotland's effort not just to attract foreign investment to the corridor of technology companies between Glasgow and Edinburgh -- an area nicknamed Silicon Glen -- but to harness Scotland's output of college graduates in a high-technology revolution of its own. **********Silicon Glen has one big edge over Silicon Valley: while California companies compete avidly to hire talent, Scotland produces far more highly trained graduates than its fledgling electronics design industry can employ. But that is also the problem: little of that home grown talent stays at home. **********''The most important thing is that we are able to take our ideas from the academic environment into the industrial department,'' Dr. Dunlop said. And the development of wireless technology is only a part of what he termed a wide range of scientific development at the university linked to businesses. **********Such thinking, Scotland's boosters maintain, is the forerunner of a fundamental change in the way Scotland handles its high-technology future, seeking a commercial edge from its successes in biotechnology -- like the cloning of Dolly the sheep -- to its advances into the domain of intellectual property in the semiconductor business. **********Even now, in a project backed by Cadence Design Systems of San Jose, Calif., Scottish authorities are preparing a 97-acre campus offering research facilities to corporations, cheek-by-jowl with an academic center -- known as the Alba Center -- designed to train graduates in advanced chip design. The intention, according to an Alba statement, is to put ''Scotland at the forefront of shaping the global electronic design industry.'' **********The project, taking shape over the last year, reflects a perception among some Scottish electronics entrepreneurs that the focus of Scotland's ambitions has rested for too long on the employment potential of foreigners' imported technology. **********''We should be doing more, looking beyond job creation to knowledge creation,'' said David Milne, 56, managing director of Wolfson Microelectronics, a successful semiconductor design company in Edinburgh that was created in 1985 as a spinoff from an academic research foundation and this year expects sales of $20 million, up from $15 million last year. **********Scotland has proved adept at persuading American concerns and other companies to set up the kind of job-producing plants and telephone call-centers that are a feature of foreign investment across Britain and Ireland. Indeed, some 40,500 people have found jobs in electronic manufacturing -- with some 29,000 more employed in the supply chain -- since companies like I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard set up manufacturing plants. **********Scotland's ambition now, though, is to build centers of high-technology innovation challenging rivals like Cambridge (Silicon Fen) or Oxford (Silicon Spires), both set up explicitly to tap academia's knowledge for industrial purposes. **********To do that, said Crawford W. Beveridge, chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, a government development agency, ''what you have to do is to play the hand you are dealt.'' **********''And,'' he added, ''we've been dealt a better hand with the university system'' than some of Scotland's European rivals. **********Indeed, with some 9 percent of Britain's 50-million-plus population, Scottish universities produce 21 percent of the nation's postgraduate degrees in computer science. And even at the college level, they punch above their weight, turning out some 2,406 engineering and technology degrees, or 11 percent of the British total of 21,010. The idea now, Mr. Beveridge said, is to create clusters, bringing together university brain with the financial brawn of the world's $7 billion semiconductor market. **********The scale of ambition is not altogether surprising. In August, Scotland's parliament was revived after 300 years, formalizing the land's claims to a separate political identity. Scotland's banks, moreover, have shown a new feistiness, competing in hostile -- if slow-moving -- maneuvers to take over one of England's biggest retail banks, National Westminster. **********In a nation whose heart once beat to the rivet guns of ship-building on the Clyde, steel and other heavy industry, Scotland has mixed a newer economic life-blood from North Sea oil, tourism, food industries and technology. That shows in familiar ways: once the depressed domain of savvy bargain-hunters, the housing market in upscale sections of Glasgow and Edinburgh has ''gone berserk,'' Mr. Beveridge said. **********And anyone who doubts that Scotland sees itself as a land apart need only contemplate the recent draw for a major soccer tournament between Scotland and England. That mid-November fixture sent a frisson through the nation's sports fans with headlines gleefully feting the looming confrontation with what Scots call the ''auld enemy'' south of the border. **********But the stand-alone ambitions are offset by a somewhat more glum reality. **********Unlike Ireland, say, Scotland has yet to reverse the brain drain that takes its graduates away to other high-technology centers offering more established career trajectories. And while Silicon Valley quests in vain for more people to employ, Silicon Glen searches desperately for technology start-ups to employ Scotland's surfeit of talent. **********''There are a lot of graduates out there,'' said Colin Thompson, a semiconductor design expert with a Scottish subsidiary of Micro Linear of San Jose. ''But there aren't enough companies that want to hire them.'' **********There is, though, a showcase of Scotland's ambitions to change all that, and it is to be found in the Alba Center, in a converted factory on the blustery outskirts of the town of Livingston, between Glasgow and Edinburgh. There, for the first time, four separate Scottish universities have joined with corporate supporters to establish a master's degree course in what its backers say is the way of the silicon future. **********What makes the $50 million project distinctive is its fusion of Scottish academic teaching and research talent with American investment to produce what its director, Kevin Casey, calls the world's first master's degree in the new technology of assembling entire systems on a single chip. And the long-term goal is to strengthen Scotland's claim on a future as an electronics design center. **********''It's not just about a job, it's about a career -- the first job, the second job, the third job,'' Mr. Casey said. ''The idea is to grow the company base so that people coming out of university and people overseas recognize that there are career opportunities in Scotland.'' And that, he said, will ''create the image of Scotland as a hotbed of activity'' in the design of single units performing functions that once required several different chips. **********Additionally, the Alba Center -- which takes its name from a ninth century union of Picts and Scots -- has a putative marketplace for chip designs that will go beyond the existing catalogs of available technology, drawing designers of ''intellectual property'' into a regulated exchange with potential corporate buyers like Advanced RISC Machines, Cadence Design Systems, Hitachi and Toshiba. **********The idea, said Andy Travers, head of what is called the Virtual Component Exchange, is to lower the marketing costs of low-budget individual designers -- known generically as ''Fred-in-a-shed,'' a term suggesting techie types laboring over high-powered computers in their back yards to produce design breakthroughs. **********Additionally, Mr. Travers said, the exchange will establish regulations and legal norms intended to cut out hefty and laborious legal processes and accelerate the transition from ''Fred's'' inventions -- known as virtual components -- to commercial products. **********In a way, Mr. Travers, 37, is an example of what Scotland wants to achieve. In 1986, with a degree in physics from Strathclyde University and four years' experience in chip design, he said, he ''wanted to see the world'' and took a job in Switzerland. After three years, though, ''I got a hankering to come back and I did,'' albeit for a ''vast cut in salary.'' **********Now, he reckons, things are changing. ''We have an influx of opportunities,'' he said. ''You can live in a country where you don't have to sit in traffic for two hours. And you can get a job that's at the forefront of the technology that matters to you. You are going to be at the cutting edge.''"

The purpose is to assist marketers considering or conducting account reviews as well as agency search consultants who work for marketers on those reviews by making it easier for them to learn about member agencies. **********''The goal is to set up a central resource balanced for all agencies, a level playing field,'' said Cleve Langton, executive vice president and director for worldwide business development at DDB Worldwide Communications Group in New York, owned by Omnicom Group. **********''This big step forward is the logical outgrowth of everything we've been doing the last two years,'' said Mr. Langton, referring to the new business committee of the Four A's, which he heads as chairman. **********The committee's work has included issuing guidelines to govern conduct during reviews and creating a standardized questionnaire to gather information from agencies taking part in reviews. Those steps were in response to what many agency executives perceive as inequities in the search process, particularly the increasing power of the independent search consultants who collect data about agency operations during the reviews they oversee. **********The Four A's data base ''is not meant to compete with or be in conflict with consultants,'' said Peter Drakoulias, a member of the new business committee who is a partner and director for business development at Deutsch Inc. in New York. **********''This is based on what the Web is all about, providing as much information to as many people as you can,'' he added. ''And the fact that it's 'brought to you by' the Four A's makes it fair and unbiased.'' **********One search consultant is skeptical of the new venture. **********''We welcome any additional source of information to help clients profile agencies,'' said Skip Pile, chairman of Pile & Company in Boston, ''but it feels a little adversarial and redundant. **********''Picking an agency using an on-line membership directory,'' according to Mr. Pile, who sponsors an agency data base of his own called www.agencycompile.com, ''is like trying to pick an architect by using the Yellow Pages.'' **********Given that Mr. Pile's Web site is just one of several similar services, both nonprofit and commercial, already dedicated to account reviews and new business, should the Four A's project have a Web address of www.toolittletoolate.org? **********''Not at all,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the agency association in New York. ''It's important that the industry have a site. **********''We've been doing a lot of work in the new business area,'' he added, referring to projects like the guidelines and the questionnaire. ''The Four A's new business Web site takes our efforts to ease the agency search process to the next level.'' **********Four A's members will be charged one-time fees ranging from $500 to $5,000 -- based on agency gross income -- to defray the start-up costs of the Web site, Mr. Drake said, adding that the association would ''put in some of our own money, too.'' Mr. Drake estimated the start-up costs at $250,000; Mr. Pile said it cost ''roughly a million bucks'' to get his site up and running. **********To build and maintain the Four A's data base, members of the new business committee selected a fledgling New York agency named Little Tornadoes. The decision came after -- yes -- a review. **********''I really felt like a client,'' said Joanne Davis, a committee member who is managing partner at Bozell Group in New York, a unit of True North Communications. **********''God, was it exciting to be on the other side,'' she added. ''I particularly liked asking 'Are you the people who will work on our account?' '' **********One of those people, Spencer Hayman, president of Little Tornadoes -- named for a band in which he played in college -- said: ''We made a 20-minute presentation and then spent an hour and a half answering questions. It was like facing the Jedi Council as a rookie knight.'' **********Plans call for the new business Web site to be ready in February or March on a section of the current Four A's Web site (www.aaaa.org), Mr. Hayman said, as well as ''having its own unique reference, as a 'dot-com' as well as a 'dot-org.' '' **********Other features being considered, he added, include so-called hot links to agencies' own Web sites and sorting agencies by categories like size, location, specialty, type of clients -- even the names of brands for which agencies create campaigns. **********Mr. Hayman opened Little Tornadoes after he left Grybauskas Beatrice in New York, where he helped start another fancifully named interactive unit, Blue Dingo Digital. Other clients of Little Tornadoes include British Airways, the Carnegie Endowment and Junior's, the Brooklyn restaurant-delicatessen. **********''We're working on a site to sell Junior's cheesecake,'' Mr. Hayman said, ''which has put about an inch on my waist already.''"

Officials are also discussing the plight of homeless civilians inside Kosovo, while conceding that the allies have no ready plan to help them. **********For that matter, the allies are not entirely sure where the wandering refugees are, or how many there are, though Western officials have said they may number from 15,000 to the tens of thousands. Before the refugees were turned back, they had been huddling on the border for days without food, water or shelter, and it was unclear how they would survive in a province ravaged by Serbian  forces who were not likely to focus their efforts on feeding displaced ethnic Albanians. **********The refugees were turned away by Serbian guards at the Macedonian and Albanian borders on Wednesday. The Serbs told them it was safe to return to their homes because President Milosevic had declared a cease-fire in Kosovo, Fabrizio Maltinti, an Italian commander involved in the NATO effort to help the refugees told reporters here today. **********NATO officials said that to make sure the refugees heeded the orders, Serbs were sealing the border with mines. The Serbs had used mines to try to prevent separatist Kosovo guerrillas from infiltrating the province; now they are blocking some of the main exit routes. **********Serbs have even placed mines along the sides of roads to insure that the refugees are channeled back toward the interior of Kosovo, one Western diplomat added. **********Yet for all the NATO reconnaissance planes and satellites over Yugoslavia, military officials have been unable to give any specific information about how many refugees had been turned back or where they were headed at this morning's closed-door briefing for allied ambassadors.  NATO's attention has been focused up till now on ferreting out Serbian armor, not following refugees, though that was likely to change with the new developments. **********Mr. Milosevic's decision to shut the border came as a shock to NATO -- as had the ferocity of his campaign to drive more than half a million ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. **********''This tactic of driving the refugees back is new,'' said Claire Short, a British official in charge of international aid. ''We do not know whether they have been driven back to their homes or elsewhere in Kosovo.'' **********Belgrade seems to have several possible goals in closing its borders to refugee flight. **********Now that Mr. Milosevic has proclaimed that peace is at hand, he apparently wants to cite the returning refugees as evidence that life is getting back to normal. Or, as the Belgrade radio put it today, ''a process of return of displaced persons has been initiated.'' **********Closing the border would also put an end to the disturbing images of fleeing refugees, images that have turned much of world public opinion against the Yugoslav Government. **********These clumsy efforts at public relations, however, are unlikely to have a major influence on NATO. The specter of desperate refugees wandering without food and shelter in Kosovo has already become another charge in the West's brief against the Milosevic regime. **********Nor does Mr. Milosevic's ''peace'' come close to meeting the alliance's demand that the Serbian forces that have been terrorizing the ethnic Albanians be withdrawn from Kosovo, and that a NATO-lead international peacekeeping force be stationed there instead. **********The decision to seal the border also may be intended to serve Belgrade's military goals. As NATO has picked up its air attacks, Serbian tanks and vehicles have sought to ward off the blows by hiding near civilian structures and population centers. **********Military planners had said last week that the routing of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo would make their targeting easier by emptying much of the province of much of its civilian population. Now, the shifting crowds of refugees will complicate planning. **********''There are no clear lines where the bad guys are and the friendlies are,'' said Maj. Gen. Charles F. Wald, a senior aide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Pentagon officials said they had no proof that the Yugoslav military was using the refugees as ''human shields,'' though they have been anecdotal reports that Serbian units have deliberately been operating near civilians. **********While the presence of thousands of additional Albanians on the battlefield will present another problem for NATO's planners, it is unlikely to present an insurmountable challenge to the allied campaign. **********The main impediment to a quick allied victory at this point is the absence of ground forces as well as self-imposed constraints against political targets, such as Belgrade's television broadcast capability. **********The Pentagon has proclaimed it has made major gains by destroying Serbian fuel supplies, but this is only an indirect blow to the fighting capability of the Serbs in Kosovo. The Serbs have already accomplished their goal of reducing the ethnic Albanian population and can conserve fuel by staying in hiding. **********The sealed-off borders, however, do heighten an already monumental aid problem. Even before the borders were closed, NATO was struggling with masses of refugees in Macedonia and Albania. **********A senior Western European diplomat said today, for example, that the allied soldiers were not aware of the  Macedonian decision to bus thousands of refugees to Albania until after the refugees were on their way out. **********Bad as things have been for refugees outside Kosovo, those who have not made it across the border are faring worse. **********A NATO diplomat said that only a few aid groups are able to work inside Kosovo: an organization inspired by Mother Teresa and an emergency team sent to Yugoslavia by the Russian Government. Their efforts are likely to be insufficient. **********The pressing question today is what NATO can do to help. As refugees rushed toward the border last week, the alliance ruled out dropping food and medicine to them inside Kosovo. It said the supplies could be used by Serbian forces and that the refugees would be taken care of after they crossed the border. **********''Now that NATO is helping to get on top of the humanitarian crisis outside Kosovo, we do not want to see a second humanitarian crisis inside Kosovo itself, with all of these people without shelter, food or any kind of assistance,'' said a NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea."

They are, he has charged, ''a truckload of squealing pigs'' and ''a batch of bandits who have betrayed, pillaged and humiliated the people.'' **********For its part, the anti-Chavez camp has sought to link the president to Fidel Castro and Cuban Communism, using Mr. Chavez's own words against him. ''I feel happy to follow the path of Fidel,'' he said during a state visit to Havana last month, adding that Venezuela was swimming ''toward the same sea as the Cuban people,'' which he described as ''a sea of happiness, social justice and true peace.'' **********To the alarm of those already suspicious of Mr. Chavez, the new charter, drafted in less than four months by an elected Constitutional Assembly in which his supporters won 90 percent of the seats, would significantly extend the powers of the executive branch of government. It abolishes the Senate, one of the two existing houses of Congress, and gives the president authority to dissolve the legislature in certain specified circumstances. The presidential term of office would expand to six years from five, and Mr. Chavez would be allowed to seek immediate re-election, which is prohibited under the current 1961 Constitution. **********In addition, the powers of states and municipalities would be significantly curbed, and the role of the military and its ability to take part in government and politics would increase. **********''In many basic respects, this constitution is a step backward from the democratic change the country has been demanding,'' said Allan Brewer Carias, a prominent lawyer here and an opposition member of the Constitutional Assembly. ''It opens the door to authoritarianism, and the authoritarian provisions it contains are certainly going to be used, if not by Chavez, then by someone else.'' **********Even the constitution's main intellectual author has now begun to express doubts about the document. Hermann Escarra, a prominent professor of constitutional law and chairman of the committee that drafted the charter, said he still planned to vote yes in the referendum on Wednesday, joining what opinion polls indicate will be strong support for the document. **********But Mr. Escarra describes the final product as ''a populist model under military tutelage'' and says he will immediately introduce amendments to weaken those tendencies. **********Mr. Escarra, who has been one of Mr. Chavez's closest legal advisers, said last week in an interview with the Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia that ''the constitution has grave incongruencies'' that allow the president ''to assume all powers,'' ''give privileges to the military'' and put them beyond civilian control. A result, he added, will be a ''restricted democracy,'' and ''that would be very disturbing.'' **********Since declaring its independence from Spain in 1811, Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves outside the Middle East, has had 25 constitutions, more than any other country in South America. Mr. Chavez, striking the kind of sweeping note that has prompted many people here to invest in him their hopes of change, says the new charter will define ''the future of Venezuelans for the next 200 years.'' **********Supporters point proudly to the broadened guarantees of individual rights that it offers, including greater recognition of the status of women and indigenous peoples. The charter also reorganizes the country's notoriously corrupt judicial system and includes a recall mechanism that in theory would allow voters to replace elected officials who fail to perform their duties properly. **********''This is the most modern and advanced constitution in the entire continent and perhaps in the world,'' Mr. Chavez said recently on his weekly radio program. He described its passage as essential to ''putting 40 years of unfettered corruption and incompetence behind us.'' **********But he has also warned of the prospect of an ''internal war'' if voters do not approve it. **********If the constitution is rejected, ''I will do everything possible so that the democratic and peaceful road continues,'' he said last month. But he added, ''I do not know if that will be possible.'' **********A recent poll here found that less than 2 percent of voters in this nation of 23 million people had actually read the draft of the new constitution, a floridly written document that has 350 articles. As a result, the vote seems to have become more of a plebiscite on Mr. Chavez, a cashiered army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992 but was elected to office with a resounding majority. **********''I'm going to vote yes because I want to give the people's president the tools he needs to govern,'' said Gumersindo Alvarez Montilla, a Chavez supporter who was handing out copies of the document at a subway stop here. ''I haven't read all of the constitution, but I don't need to. For me, it is enough that this is Chavez's project, that this is what he wants.'' **********But Mr. Chavez's popularity and the apparent support for his charter have not stopped an informal coalition of political, business, religious and human rights groups from focusing on what they see as dangerous flaws in a document they say was hastily and carelessly drafted. **********Human rights groups here and abroad, for instance, have expressed concern about a provision that requires news organizations to publish only ''truthful, opportune and impartial'' reports. They say the provision would open the door to official censorship and intimidation, since it is unclear who would determine what meets those standards. **********Most of Venezuela's main business organizations have come out against the charter. They worry about articles that promise workers a ''living'' wage without specifying how that would be calculated, prohibit ''unjustified'' dismissals, reduce the work week and guarantee health care and social security benefits to all Venezuelans, even those who have not contributed to the system, without making clear who will pay that cost. **********The Central Bank has taken out full-page newspaper ads to warn that its independence and ability to fight inflation would be sapped by a requirement that it subordinate its policies to those of the government. The president of the state oil company, a Chavez ally, has also complained about provisions that forbid privatization of the company and reserve all ''strategic'' sectors of the economy for the state."

It may not be surprising that a writer willing to take on that kind of writing challenge has issued another challenge, to an icon-obsessed culture that increasingly is interposing a graphical computer interface between people and the physical world. **********He is disturbed by a society that has come to depend on the metaphor of the graphical user interface, or G.U.I., to get access to and control every electronic device. A passionate defense of the point of view that not everything in the world can be reduced to an icon or a check box, Mr. Stephenson's essay, ''In the Beginning Was the Command Line,'' can be found on the Web site of ''Cryptonomicon,'' which was published last month by Avon Books (www.cryptonomicon.com). **********''There are some things that are simply not reducible to a point-and-click interface,'' he said recently in a telephone interview. ''There are some kinds of textual communication that can convey things that can't be conveyed visually.'' **********It is a view that echoes the alarms of George Orwell, who in his novel ''1984'' envisioned the idea of Newspeak, a totalitarian language that narrowed the range of thought so that an individual could not even think critical or subversive thoughts. **********Similarly, the radical social philosopher Herbert Marcuse proposed the idea of ''one-dimensional thought'' to explain the language of the 1950's and 1960's, which introduced phrases like ''clean bomb'' and ''harmless fallout.'' **********Now Mr. Stephenson is warning that the rise of a computerized visual interface culture may have the same effect. **********It is a lonesome view in a computer world in which mice and other pointing devices have become the ubiquitous controls for G.U.I.'s that mediate between people, computers and ultimately the rest of the physical world. **********An effort to shield computer users from complexity, the G.U.I. first emerged in the early 1970's from a small research laboratory at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center that was developing a computer environment known as Smalltalk. **********However, in the late 1970's, on a visit to the center, Steven P. Jobs, a founder of Apple Computer, saw it and chose to enshrine it as virtual religion in his Macintosh computer. Indeed the first Macintosh had such a fanatical commitment to the mouse  that it did away with cursor keys on the keyboard. Microsoft followed suit with Windows and brought mice and icons to the rest of the computing world. **********Now that evolution is about to jump beyond the desktop computer. In the emerging post-PC world, technologies like Sun's Jini, Microsoft's Ultimate Plug and Play, Sony's Home Audiovisual Interface and Nokia's Wide Area Protocol are competing to extend a computer metaphor outward toward controlling all of the appliances that surround us with the same desktop PC metaphor. **********Such an ''interface culture,'' Mr. Stephenson argues, is the next step toward a global monoculture that was first created by the rise of television. ''To traditional cultures, especially word-based ones such as Islam, this is infinitely more threatening than the B-52's ever were,'' he writes. **********If Mr. Stephenson has become a G.U.I. heretic, he is far from a Luddite. A skilled programmer who once considered producing his novel ''Snow Crash'' as a CD-ROM multimedia game before concluding that computers didn't have enough horsepower, he now writes with fountain pens on a thin masonite ''laptop'' board that he travels with. He has taken to traveling without a portable computer, saying that he decided to give up ''on the hassle.'' **********However, once he has written a first draft on paper, he sits down in front of his computer at his Seattle home and rewrites and edits the text before sending it to the publisher. ''Cryptonomicon'' took him two years to write by hand and another year to rewrite on the computer. **********His computer runs the free Linux operating system and he rewrites his fiction with the Emacs text editor, favored by the world's most skilled programmers. **********''If you are a professional writer -- i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words are formatted and printed -- Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars,'' he writes. ''It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.'' He is a believer in Emacs because of the remarkable control it gives writers over their words compared with other text editors or word processors. **********Mr. Stephenson's essay is written in the form of a long autobiography of a computer user, stretching from his first acoustic-coupler connected terminal to a recent infatuation with the Be operating system. It is not entirely a love affair. **********He was a fervent Macintosh user until sometime in 1995, when, while he was on a trip in San Francisco, the version of Microsoft Word running on his Powerbook crashed in such a catastrophic fashion that neither of two disk repair utilities could find any trace of the long document he had been writing. **********He acknowledges that when he returned home he was able to salvage an earlier version from a backup disk. But the event was clearly traumatizing and it undermined  his trust in the Macintosh operating system forever. **********In leaving the Macintosh world, Mr. Stephenson went back to what he calls ''the oral tradition'' of the Unix-Linux operating world. **********Linux may one day rival Windows and the Mac for ease of use, but that is not an era he would look forward to. **********Today Linux is a computer hacker's paradise that exposes all of the innards of a computer to the user to be tweaked and customized. Indeed, the Unix tradition is the exact opposite of Apple-Macintosh operating systems, which try to protect the user from the complexities of a computer. **********Mr. Stephenson acknowledges that even though Linux is relatively ''bomb proof,'' free and powerful, it may not be for everyone. **********He draws an analogy by comparing computer operating systems to auto dealerships, all operating at an intersection along a highway. In this world the Mac OS becomes an attractive Euro-style sedan whose innards are hermetically sealed from the driver. Microsoft's Windows becomes a colossal station wagon with all the esthetic appeal of a Soviet worker housing block (''It leaked oil and blew gaskets, and it was an enormous success''). By the same token Windows NT is an off-road vehicle and the Be OS is a Batmobile. **********And Linux? Linux is not even a car dealership, but rather a bunch of people who live in yurts, tepees and geodesic domes in a field, building super tanks and giving them away. **********He portrays an imaginary conversation between a Linux hacker and a potential station wagon buyer: **********Hacker: ''But if you accept one of our free tanks, we will send volunteers to your house to fix it for free while you sleep!'' **********Buyer: ''Stay away from my house, you freak!'' **********Hacker: ''But . . . '' **********Buyer: ''Can't you see that everyone is buying station wagons?''"

But to ease charitable giving, the firm has loosened the restrictions to allow charities to sell shares donated by 350 current and former partners. The firm said yesterday that it had registered the possible sale of shares valued at up to $500 million with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Goldman's public offering raised $3.7 billion and gave partners in the previously private firm a paper windfall on their ownership stakes. Partners do not have to pay taxes on their shares until selling them, meaning that they do not necessarily face a giant tax bill this year. But with a big chunk of their net worth tied up in stock, many partners had pushed for the right to donate shares to charity to offset taxes, Goldman officials said. **********''Since the public offering, the former partners have sought to direct a portion of the stock they received to educational and other charitable institutions,'' the chairman and chief executive, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said in a statement. ''This transaction will exactly accomplish that.'' **********The firm loosened restrictions on seven million shares, valued at $500 million, held by partners. If all of those shares were donated to charities and the charities sold them, the number of shares circulating on the stock market would increase by about 10 percent, to 76 million, according to the S.E.C. filing. **********Shares of Goldman closed yesterday at $71.9375, up 6.25 cents. **********David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said the $500 million figure was an estimate of potential partner giving. Each of the firm's partners will decide whether, how much and to what nonprofit organizations to make gifts. **********After its initial stock offering, Goldman also set up a charitable foundation financed with $200 million of Goldman stock. The foundation is still in the development stage."

The King is thought by many to be a reincarnation of the god Vishnu. The elected Parliament is widely viewed as replete with pocket-stuffing crooks. The bomb-throwing revolutionaries are considered by many to be fighting their ''people's war'' with lunatic acts of terrorism. **********In a two-stage election, on May 3 and 17, voters had the opportunity to create some order out of this social entropy, and if local analysts are correct they demonstrated admirable wisdom. **********Ignoring the Maoists' command to boycott the elections -- a directive ominously underscored with a few beheadings -- and largely shunning politicians who favor a return to absolute monarchy, the people gave a majority of the seats in Parliament to the Nepali Congress Party. **********That will allow a single political camp a long-sought chance to govern without sharing power in a foredoomed coalition. **********''Up until now, democracy has more or less meant multiparty chaos,'' said Devendra Raj Panday, an economist and author here in Katmandu. ''Coalitions of odd bedfellows with no ideological compatibility have been running things. Apparently the people have now realized that one party or another has to be given a chance to govern.'' **********With 23 million people, Nepal is an Arkansas-sized nation landlocked between India and China. Until 50 years ago it was largely isolated from the rest of the world. The annual per capita income is still only $210. The adult literacy rate is 40 percent. Average life expectancy is 57. **********In 1990 political agitation forced the Harvard-educated, walrus-mustached King Birendra to give up most of his absolute powers and accept a constitutional monarchy. **********But the years of democracy have been marked by a hapless cavalcade of seven Prime Ministers, most of them the product of bizarre alliances cobbled together only to fall apart. **********Royalists, social democrats, moderate Communists, less moderate Communists, entirely immoderate Communists -- they have all taken turns in the foreground like the circling figurines on a cuckoo clock. **********Among the consequences has been political corruption that is denied by no one. ''If you're in the Government, and you think it might last only six months or so, you've got to stuff your wallet fast,'' said a Western diplomat. **********The term ''Pajero culture'' has become popular -- an allusion to an expensive Japanese vehicle favored by the elite. Just as the King's courtiers became exempt from heavy import duties on automobiles, members of Parliament voted themselves the same privilege. **********''Rather than a new beginning, the goal was to get on the old gravy train,'' said Mana Ranjan Josse, Nepal's best-known newspaper columnist. ''Most politicians didn't even keep the Pajeros. They sold them to businessmen for a handsome reward in rupees.'' **********The most recent election was called after the governing Nepali Congress -- best-described as a social democratic party -- had a falling out with its main coalition partner, the Marxist-Leninists, best described as a breakaway group from the more-temperate Unified Marxist-Leninists. **********Voting was held in two stages to allow 35,000 soldiers and police officers to protect the voters from the Maoists. The resulting tally went beyond even what optimists had predicted. **********The success may be attributed to a show of unity by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, 75, who offered to step aside for a fellow war horse and longtime party rival, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, 74. Once before, the Nepali Congress won a majority in Parliament, but feuding between those leaders split the party's votes. **********''We burned our fingers by quarreling between ourselves and lost the Government,'' Mr. Bhattarai said in an interview. ''We will not make this mistake again.'' **********[Mr. Bhattarai was sworn in as Prime Minister on May 31 and named a 16-member Cabinet, all from his own party.] **********Born in India to exiled parents, Mr. Bhattarai is one of Nepal's legendary freedom fighters. As a young man he was imprisoned for 14 years after an arrest in a Kafkaesque manner by the King's Government for ''offenses that will remain unknown to you.'' **********A lifelong bachelor, he is a devout Hindu, but his religion did not keep him from earning a reputation as a connoisseur of beautiful women and strong drink. These days, age has blunted those appetites, he said. He is more devoted to yoga. **********He is fatalistic about corruption, explaining that craving possessions ''is a natural human weakness.'' And he is complimentary toward King Birenda, calling him a ''fine, highly educated gentleman,'' though adding that he is surrounded by courtiers who are scoundrels. **********He dismissed Maoism as a movement that had failed to move very many. ''They are on the run,'' he said with condescension. **********According to confidential police files, the Maoists have a well-trained, dedicated fighting force of only about 200 soldiers. But the police say they can assemble student and worker militias that raise their military strength above 4,000. **********So far, the Maoists have made themselves felt in 37 of Nepal's 75 districts, though the police say the guerrillas are ''very strong'' in only four places in the remote western hills. Favored tactics include assaults on constabularies and on agricultural banks, where the records of loans to farmers are ceremoniously destroyed. **********Like its democracy, Nepal's Maoist revolution seems to be feeling its way, trying to master the basics. The guerrillas have only recently begun using explosives that are set off by remote control. They finance themselves largely through extortion, the police say. **********The Government says the Maoists have killed 43 policemen and 72 civilians since early 1996. The police say they have killed 519 rebels. Both sides have been accused of ruthlessness by human rights groups. **********''The Maoists have killed too many innocents to be an effective champion of the people,'' said Mr. Bhattarai, who had seated himself in a yogic posture on a floor mat. As an example, he cited the pre-election throat-slitting of a candidate, Yadu Gautam. Voters objected. They elected Mr. Gautam's wife instead. **********''Democracy has a solid future in Nepal,'' Mr. Bhattarai said with an air of confidence. ''Don't you think it's about time?''"

They will still have a tougher time than investors in most other countries, analysts said. But the new rules may prove to be a first step in the right direction. **********It is good news for prospective investors and for the companies. If, for example, an European Internet company is being taken over โ the goal of many start ups โ its American investors will not be relegated to the sidelines, forced to stand idly by while their fellow shareholders rake in the proceeds of a cash or stock-based merger. **********That is provided that they and their compatriots together own less than 10 percent of the company's securities and that no American company is involved in the transaction. There will be limited exemptions when American shareholders hold from 10 percent to 15 percent of the securities. **********As for the companies, the new SEC rules will encourage many to tap the American markets for capital without fear of later running afoul of the country's securities laws. They will be able to inform U.S. investors about their merger plans but avoid the worst of SEC paperwork. **********The SEC's current legislation requires companies that contact U.S. shareholders in the target company to adhere to U.S. laws as well as those of their home country. That adds significant expense and risk to any deal, analysts said. Not surprisingly, many companies choose to exclude their U.S. investors from the transaction. **********The SEC will continue to require full disclosure on such specialized industries as banking and insurance. **********SEC officials said the new rules tried to strike a balance between the need to protect American investors from overseas companies unwilling to comply with U.S. securities regulations and the desire of American investors to participate in foreign transactions. The SEC's decision to open the door wider to foreign companies is part of a broader drive to increase the access of U.S. small investors to mergers and acquisitions. In recent weeks, it has also announced new rules aimed a providing investors with more information about domestic mergers and tender offers. **********The chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, has also called on U.S. companies to open their quarterly earnings conference calls to all investors and to post the information on the Internet. **********The SEC said the changes to the rules governing foreign companies rule would bring its disclosure requirements closer to the international standards endorsed late last year by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO, the global association of securities regulators. **********The IOSCO disclosure standards are ""a good first step toward creating a framework for an international passport to the world's capital markets,"" said Brian Lane, director of the SEC's finance division."

""It is useful to preempt forces of imbalance before they threaten economic activity."" **********Mr. Greenspan was far from explicit about the likelihood of a rate increase this month. But financial markets appeared to understand his better-sooner-than-later tone the same way: that the Fed's policy-setting committee most likely will lift the short-term interest rate by a quarter-percent to 5 percent in an effort to avoid an overheating economy. **********Stock prices were higher and bond prices rallied after Mr. Greenspan's remarks Thursday. **********The guessing in the markets appeared to be that if the Fed did edge up the key interest rate at its June 29-30 meeting, the likelihood of additional increases in August and October appeared smaller than previously. That conclusion was bolstered when the government said Wednesday that consumer prices were stable in May after an upward spike the month before. **********The economy is now in its 98th month of expansion, a remarkable run that has defied all expectations. After showing exceptionally strong growth of 6.8 percent annually in the fourth quarter of last year, it expanded at a 4.1 percent rate in the first three months of this year. **********Over the past three years, it has averaged 4 percent growth. Many economists say that rates above 3 percent are likely, in time, to bring higher inflation. **********Mr. Greenspan backed indirectly into his suggestions that a rate increase might be coming. If the Fed's Open Market Committee were to decide ""that it was desirable to raise rates,"" he said, ""it would be doing so because we believe that would increase the probability of sustaining the expansion."" **********Many of his pronouncements were strongly positive. U.S. prices and underlying cost fundamentals are stable now, he said; Asian and Latin American economies are clearly on a stronger footing, even if their comebacks from financial crisis remain fragile; international financial markets have stabilized, and a nimble, increasingly technology-based U.S. economy has found ways unanticipated a few years ago to combine strong growth and low inflation rates. **********""An impressive proliferation of new technologies,"" Mr. Greenspan said, ""is inducing major shifts in the underlying structure of the American economy."" **********But to the kudos he attached caveats. **********""For monetary policy to foster maximum sustainable economic growth, it is useful to preempt forces of imbalance before they threaten economic activity,"" he said, even as he left open an exit door, adding, ""The future at times can be too opaque to penetrate."" **********A growing, high-end economy needs more skilled workers or more efficient work practices or both, he said; yet that very growth has reduced the available worker pool. **********In fact, in the first quarter, worker output per hour rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate. But Mr. Greenspan had already warned, on Monday, that the sharp gains in productivity could not continue indefinitely. The inflation threat has grown as companies and consumers, encouraged by the economic good news and by strong equity prices, have spent beyond their means. **********The May consumer-price data leave the Fed facing a bit of a quandary. Inflation is momentarily not an issue, appearing ""well contained"" for now, Mr. Greenspan said Thursday. **********But with unemployment at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent, there is precious little margin for the economy to keep growing without adding to wage pressures, which lead indirectly to higher prices. Average hourly earnings have already begun to rise. Still, with the economy already defying conventional economic wisdom, Mr. Greenspan has for months resisted calls from others in the Fed system for a rate increase. **********Mr. Greenspan has been widely credited with nursing the economy along toward its record performance, along with Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. On Thursday, Mr. Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, told a Senate committee that if he is confirmed as Mr. Rubin's successor, he will continue his boss's policies, emphasizing free trade and sound spending. **********Mr. Greenspan expressed particular concern for record-high share prices. A ""benign"" economic environment, he said, could be encouraging investors to incur unreasonable risks and drive asset prices to ""unsustainable"" levels. **********""Whether that means an unstable bubble has developed in its wake,' he said, ""is difficult to assess."""

She was dressed in a wide collared lavender floral print blouse and gray tweed skirt and clutching a handwritten piece of paper with slightly trembling fingers. **********''I did what I did not to make money but to help prevent the defeat of a new system which had, at great cost, given ordinary people food and fares which they could afford, a good education and a health service,'' she read in a firm voice. **********Explaining her motive, Mrs. Norwood said, ''I thought perhaps what I had access to might be useful in helping Russia to keep abreast of  Britain, America and Germany.'' She added, ''In general, I do not agree with spying against one's country.'' **********There were several cries of ''traitor!'' from the crowd in her street. As she retreated back into her house, she murmured, ''No, no, no,'' to shouted questions asking whether she regretted her actions. **********Mrs. Norwood had been obliged to confront the press gathered at her gate by disclosures of her past in The Times of London. She told the newspaper that ''in the same circumstances, I know that I would do the same thing again.'' **********The newspaper will begin on Monday to serialize a book published in Britain as ''The Mitrokhin Archive: The K.G.B. in Europe and the West,'' by a Cambridge professor, Christopher Andrew. It is based on the six trunkloads of documents brought to the West by Vasily Mitrokhin, 77, the former chief archivist of the K.G.B.'s foreign intelligence section, who defected to the British in 1992. **********Today's newspapers predicted that the excerpts from Professor Andrew's book and an accompanying BBC documentary called ''The Spying Game'' would unmask up to a dozen more Britons who worked for Soviet intelligence, including a former Scotland Yard officer and a person described tantalizingly by the author as ''a prominent public figure who is now dead.'' **********Home Secretary Jack Straw has asked Britain's internal Security Service, M.I.5, for a full report on the case, but a Home Office spokeswoman said today that the Government would have no comment on the other names emerging. ''It is a longstanding policy not to confirm or deny the details of security service investigations,'' she said. **********Tom King, chairman of the Parliamentary Security and Intelligence Committee, promised an investigation by lawmakers, saying, ''Questions need to be asked about who knew what when, and why there were no prosecutions.'' **********It seemed that Britain was headed into another of the spy expose frenzies that have occurred periodically with the unmaskings of men like Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt and John Cairncross who followed their Communist sympathies into espionage. **********Where those men hid their activities behind their upper-class backgrounds, elite educations and urbanity, Mrs. Norwood disguised hers with her complete suburban unremarkableness. **********She worked as a secretary at the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association, the home of the Tube Alloys project. That was the anodyne name given to Britain's nuclear weapons reseach program that is sometimes compared to the more famous American project conducted in Los Alamos, N.M. Mrs. Norwood regularly removed files from a safe after hours, copied them and turned them over to Soviet agents in meetings in the leafy southeastern suburbs where she has lived for more than 50 years. **********In the interview with The Times of London, she said that her husband, Hilary, a mathematics teacher who died in 1986, shared her Communist ideology but disapproved of her actively aiding the Russians. On nights when she was delayed getting home by her appointments with her K.G.B. handlers, she said, she would blame it on traffic tie-ups -- an excuse he accepted though he knew it to be sham. **********The couple's daughter, Anita Ferguson, 56, a biologist living in Staffordshire, said she learned of her mother's activity from the newspaper report on Saturday. ''When I first saw all the details, I just felt complete disbelief,'' she said. ''It was a very big shock, I had no idea, no idea at all.'' Mrs. Ferguson said she would stand by her mother -- a great-grandmother -- ''whatever she may have done'' and voiced relief that she had not been told before. **********''It's probably better I didn't know,'' she said. ''I would not have liked to have kept such a secret.'' **********In the BBC interview for broadcast next Sunday, Mrs. Norwood explains that in addition to sympathizing with the social gains that the Soviet experiment promised, she thought that in the postwar era, the Soviet Union represented the only counterbalance to capitalism and that the West should not be allowed an advantage as great as sole possession of nuclear bombs. **********''I thought they should somehow be adequately defended because everyone was against them, against this experiment, and they had been through such hardship from the Germans,'' she told her television interviewer. ''In the war the Russians were on our side, and it was unfair to them that they shouldn't be able to develop their weaponry.'' **********She was born Melita Sirnis in 1912 near Southampton, the daughter of an English mother and a Latvian father who was a follower of Leo Tolstoy. Her father died when she was six, but her mother was active in leftist causes, instilling in her children strong sentiments against all war and sympathy for countries like Germany that the family viewed as victims of warfare. **********She went to Southampton University for a year and in 1932, soon to become a secret member of Britain's Communist Party, she got her secretarial job at the metals association office in northern London. **********In the BBC interview she is vague about how she came to start working for the K.G.B. five years later, saying only, ''Somebody said that my work might be an interesting source of material.'' She claims failing memory as a reason for not being able to recall the names of any of the people she dealt with. **********Known as ''Letti'' to her friends, she was identified in K.G.B. documents by the code name ''Hola.''  Asked if she had ever been frightened of being caught, she said, ''I suppose so, but I can't remember pondering it.'' **********On her retirement in 1972, K.G.B. files complimented her as ''a committed, reliable and disciplined agent, striving to be of the utmost assistance.'' When she visited Moscow with her husband in 1979, she was given an honor for her work, the Order of the Red Banner, which she accepted, and offered a financial reward, which she turned down. **********People in the neighborhood said they were aware that Mrs. Norwood, locally famed for the quality of her homemade chutney, held radical views for their largely Conservative-voting area. Along with the geraniums in her windows there are anti-war and nuclear disarmament stickers, and on a cupboard shelf visible through the kitchen window is a mug with Che Guevara's bearded face on it. **********This afternoon she strolled in her garden at the request of photographers but refused to answer any questions. ''I'm sorry to get you all out like this on a Sunday,'' she told the waiting journalists. ''But I suppose it's all right as long as you are getting paid for it.'' **********At Dillons Newsagents, Peter Dodd, the assistant manager, said he had been surprised years ago when he first saw her orders for Communist publications. ''I thought, 'Who is  this nutter?' '' he said. ''But she was just the normal grandmother who came in once a week to pay her bill.'' **********Ray Simmons, 67, a retired chief technician at the University of Greenwich, who lives nearby, commented: ''I've known her for 20 years, and she never gave a hint of anything like that. It's quite a shock to be told that the sweet old lady round the corner has been a K.G.B. spy.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/17/business/short-term-rates-are-raised-by-fed-a-quarter-point.html,Richard Stevenson,1999-11-17,"Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent, saying combination of strong growth and low unemployment has left economy vulnerable to inflation; move follows two previous quarter-point increases in June and Aug...",1327,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,SHORT-TERM RATES ARE RAISED BY FED A QUARTER-POINT,SHORT-TERM RATES ARE RAISED BY FED A QUARTER-POINT," **********The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point today, saying that the combination of strong growth and low unemployment had left the economy vulnerable to an outbreak of inflation. **********It was the third time this year that the central bank had raised rates to check the economy's momentum, and the move clearly signaled that the Fed's growing faith in technology's ability to improve business efficiency and temper inflationary pressures has its limits. **********In explaining its action, the Fed emphasized a concern that Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, has stressed repeatedly in recent months: that the nation is literally running out of workers and that, as it does so, wages and then prices will inevitably be pushed higher, endangering an economic expansion that is about to become the longest in the nation's history. **********The Fed said it was raising its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent; the move followed two other quarter-point increases this year, in June and August. Today's increase took back the last of three quarter-point reductions  made last year in response to the global financial crisis and returned the rate to its level 14 months ago. **********The central bank also removed its formal stance toward higher rates, moving to a neutral one that analysts said all but ruled out a rate increase at the next monetary policy meeting, which is scheduled for Dec. 21. **********The Dow Jones industrial average rose immediately after the Fed's announcement this afternoon, fell back, then surged again to finish at 10,932.33, up 171.58 points. [Page C1.] **********It was the highest level for the index in more than two months and suggested that investors see no more rate increases coming before the Fed's first meeting of 2000, a two-day session on Feb. 1 and 2. **********The central bank also said it would increase its largely symbolic discount rates on loans to financial institutions from the Federal Reserve system to 5 percent, from 4.75 percent. It was the second quarter-point increase in the rate this year after two quarter-point reductions last year. **********The increase in the Fed's official short-term rates quickly began to affect the rates paid by businesses and consumers. Banks started raising their prime lending rate by a quarter of a point, to 8.5 percent, a move that will lead to higher rates on credit card, automobile and other consumer loans. Rates set directly or indirectly in the bond market, like those for mortgage loans, also edged up. **********The Fed seemed to leave open the possibility that it could raise rates further next year if the economy keeps roaring along and unemployment keeps falling. But for investors, the good news was a hint from the Fed that it did not plan to raise rates again at least for the rest of this year. The central bank said the cumulative effect of its three rate increases this year ''should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward.'' **********The American economy has been growing steadily for more than eight and a half years, driving unemployment down to 4.1 percent last month -- the lowest level in nearly three decades -- while allowing workers to enjoy higher wage gains than they have in years. Yet there has been no solid evidence that inflation is building, casting doubt on traditional economic models that predict a trade-off between falling joblessness and rising wages and prices. **********Many economists have sought to explain the situation by asserting that huge investments by businesses in computers and other efficiency-enhancing technology are yielding substantial improvements in productivity, or hourly output by each worker. As productivity growth accelerates, it helps companies keep their costs under control even if wages rise, making it possible for them to maintain profit margins without increasing prices. **********Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials have increasingly come to accept that recent gains in productivity are more than a temporary blip, and they have become optimistic in their public statements about the economy's resilience and long-term growth prospects. **********But in raising rates today -- at a time when the economy is already showing signs of slowing and price increases are well contained -- Mr. Greenspan showed that he was not ready to abandon the notion that low unemployment plus robust growth is a recipe for inflation. **********''Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist,'' the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement released soon after 2:15 p.m. **********''Despite tentative evidence of slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential,'' the statement said. ''As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue.'' **********Economists had been sharply divided before today's meeting about whether a rate increase would be justified, and the Fed's decision led some of them to assert that the central bank was failing to take account of the economy's improved capacity to grow without inflation. They said the Fed should have taken more time to let the previous two rate increases of this year slow the economy and ease pressure on labor markets. **********''If this was a football game, I think I'd throw a yellow flag for piling on,'' said Martin Regalia, an economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington. **********Mr. Regalia said that while the Fed officials' ''rhetoric seems to have shifted to an acceptance of productivity gains, their actions are clearly more consistent with the traditional labor-market-tightness arguments.'' **********Other analysts said that the economy was continuing to grow faster than the 3 percent to 3.5 percent annual rate that is widely viewed as a ''speed limit'' beyond which inflation can start to take off. **********''The Fed believes, as I do, that the economy's speed limit is higher than we thought it was a few years back, but that doesn't mean in any sense that the economy does not still have a speed limit,'' said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. **********With growth exceeding that limit and showing no clear signs of moderating, Mr. Berner said, ''the balance of inflation risks still lies to the side of higher rather than lower inflation.'' **********Even before today's statement suggesting that the Fed will be on hold for the rest of the year, analysts had expected the central bank to leave rates untouched for several months because of the uncertainty about how Year 2000 computer problems will affect the economy and the financial system. **********If nothing else, economists expect that it could be difficult for the Fed to draw conclusions about the economy's path during the next few months because statistics may be distorted by businesses' building extra inventory and consumers' holding more cash than they otherwise would. As a result, some analysts say the Fed may shy away from raising rates at its February meeting even if growth seems to remain strong. **********The question over the longer run is whether the economy will again defy predictions that it is about to slow, leading the Fed to consider further rate increases next year. **********The economy has been growing steadily since March 1991. In January, barring a collapse in the next six weeks, it will set a new milestone, breaking the record for the longest expansion in the nation's history, 8 years and 10 months, which was set during the 1960's. **********During the last several years growth has proved remarkably impervious both to shocks from the rest of the world and to higher interest rates at home, and seems to have drawn sustenance in particular from the boom in the stock market. **********Fed officials insist that they have not set out to push Wall Street lower, but they say they remain concerned that the market's buoyancy, even in the face of tighter monetary policy, is helping to keep consumer demand at a higher level than they are comfortable with."

He was 82 and lived in Cork, his native city, south of Dublin. **********His restraint is now widely seen as the beginning of a more tolerant Irish attitude toward British sovereignty in the Protestant-dominated North, leading ultimately to the peace effort in 1993 that produced the peace agreement of 1998. The accord gives Roman Catholics more political power while keeping the province British, and though implementation is stalled, it is still alive. **********Mr. Lynch, a tall, pipe-smoking former star athlete in hurling and Gaelic football, also moved Ireland into the European Economic Community in 1973, when the country was suffering a depressed economy and losing tens of thousands of emigrants. Billions of dollars of European aid gradually helped Ireland become one of the world's 25 richest nations, with an unemployment rate half the European Union average. **********Mr. Lynch was Prime Minister, or Taoiseach (TEE-shuck), from 1966 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1979. **********In 1969 he resisted pressure from his party, Fianna Fail, and from many people in Ireland to send troops across the northern border to protect Catholics in Londonderry who were under attack by the police and Protestant paramilitaries. **********Hopes of militant nationalists had been raised when he said, ''It is clear the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people being injured, or worse.'' **********British officials found the remark inflammatory, but Mr. Lynch never did order troops to invade the northern province. He also established field hospitals along the border for Catholics coming south to avoid violence in the north. **********In 1990, after he had retired from politics, Mr. Lynch said sending in the troops, a tactic that he considered to persuade the United Nations to send a peacekeeping mission, could have killed 250,000 civilians and soldiers in an Irish-British war. **********When Mr. Lynch had traveled to Belfast earlier to discuss peace with British officials, the flamboyant Protestant leader and self-professed anti-Catholic, the Rev. Ian Paisley, led a group of Protestant politicians in pelting Mr. Lynch's car with snowballs. But by the late 70's Mr. Lynch was talking about peace and tolerance with Margaret Thatcher, then the British Prime Minister. **********He had also assuaged British misgivings -- while provoking Irish Republican anger -- when he dismissed Charles J. Haughey from his Cabinet in 1970. Mr. Haughey, who succeeded Mr. Lynch as Prime Minister in 1979, was accused and acquitted in an Irish court of plotting to send guns to northern Catholics. **********Mr. Haughey, whose finances are now under scrutiny by two special tribunals and who is alleged to have taken millions of dollars in gifts from business executives and loan write-offs from banks, declined today to discuss their differences, saying only that Mr. Lynch ''had a capacity to reassure the public.'' **********The current Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, said of Mr. Lynch, ''His firm leadership saw the nation through a period of great political tension and turbulence, and his outstanding work to gain Irish membership in the E.E.C. changed forever the way we see ourselves as a nation.'' **********Mr. Lynch is survived by his wife, Mairin, The Associated Press reported."

He was 75. **********Mr. Sands took over a small bulk wine producer in Canandaigua, about 25 miles southeast of Rochester, that his father had acquired, eventually building it into one of America's big makers of mass-produced wine. **********The Sands family was in the wine business as early as 1932, when Mordecai E. Sands, Marvin Sands's father, was a partner in a winery in Long Island City, Queens. In 1945, when Marvin Sands was just out of the Navy, the Sands family bought a Canandaigua, N.Y., sauerkraut factory-turned-winery for $60,000. **********From 1945 to 1954, Canandaigua Industries, as it was called, struggled, selling fruit wines in bulk to local bottlers, who would then sell them under their own brand names. As California companies like Gallo and Italian Swiss Colony began creating national brands, Mr. Sands tried to create a brand himself. **********He failed with King Solomon kosher wine and a Sands line, but in 1954 finally succeeded with a flaming-red blend of dessert wine named Richard's Wild Irish Rose, after his son Richard. **********Wild Irish Rose became synonymous with Canandaigua, representing more than 90 percent of the company's sales during the early 1960's. On that base Mr. Sands slowly expanded, acquiring 11 small wineries through 1984. **********At first, these were relatively small deals -- $10 million to $20 million -- for small, well-known wine brands like Manischewitz and Italian Swiss Colony. As the sales volume swelled, distribution overhead stayed relatively steady and profit rose. The acquisition pace was stepped up in the 1990's. **********In a buying spree that began in 1991, Canandaigua acquired Guild Wineries and Distillers, a California growers' cooperative whose Cook's champagne made Canandaigua the nation's No. 2 producer of sparkling wine, after Gallo. **********In 1993, the acquisition of Barton Inc. carried the rights to import Corona Beer from Mexico. Vintners International, picked up four months later, brought in brands including Paul Masson and Taylor California Cellars. **********In June 1994, Canandaigua acquired Almaden and Inglenook from Heublein Inc. And in 1995, it bought 30 brands of spirits from United Distillers Glenmore. **********Matthew Clark P.L.C., a big British producer and distributor of everything from wine to bottled water, joined the fold in 1998. So far this year, Canandaigua has picked up eight brands of Canadian whisky, including Black Velvet and Golden Wedding, two Canadian distilleries and two California estate wineries, Simi and Franciscan Estates. **********Today, Canandaigua is the country's second-largest wine producer after E.& J. Gallo; the second-largest beer importer, after Heineken, and the fourth-largest spirits producer. Worldwide, it is 3d in wine production and 10th in spirits. **********Mr. Sands served as chief executive of Canandaigua, which is now based in Fairport, a suburb of Rochester, from 1945 until 1993. During his career, he was also president of the Finger Lakes Wine Growers Association and was a founder of the American Vintners Association, a national trade association. **********Richard Sands took over as president of Canandaigua in 1993 and chief executive in 1996. Another son, Robert Sands, is chief executive for international operations and vice president and general counsel of Canandaigua Brands and chief executive of the Canandaigua Wine Company. **********Mr. Sands was active in community affairs and in philanthropy. Among his leadership roles, he was chairman of F. F. Thompson Health Systems and affiliated organizations for more than 25 years. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Finger Lakes Performing Arts Center, which was constructed as the summer home of the Rochester Philharmonic. **********Mr. Sands graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He served as an ensign in the Navy during World War II. **********In addition to his sons, he is survived by his wife of 52 years, Mickey Sands, of Canandaigua; a son-in-law, Dr. Andrew Stern, of Pittsford, N.Y., and several grandchildren. His daughter, Dr. Laurie Sands, died of cancer in 1995."

The measure tracks changes in total compensation -- wages and salaries, of course, but also fringe benefits like health insurance and pension contributions. Both benefits and pay leapt, with the biggest increases coming in the highest-  and lowest-paying industries. **********Investors appeared worried that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who closely monitors the gauge, might now be more likely to favor raising interest rates in the near future as a preventive measure against rising prices. **********The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 180.78 points, or 1.65 percent, to close at 10,791.29. The broader market fell even more, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index down 1.78 percent and the Nasdaq composite index dropping 2.43 percent. **********The Treasury market, ever sensitive to inflation fears, took a direct hit. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond was down about three-quarters of a point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent from 6 percent on Wednesday. **********The Fed already nudged short-term rates up by a quarter of a point at the end of June, and in the past several days Mr. Greenspan has warned that he would act ''promptly and forcefully'' at the first hint that inflation was accelerating. **********But several analysts cautioned that the financial markets may have overreacted to the threat of inflation and that any upswing in prices was likely to be muted. **********''The best days of inflation news may be behind us,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the Fleet Bank in Hartford. Still, he added, ''nothing untoward is necessarily down the road.'' **********And Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock, the insurance and investment company in Boston, said that the big rise in compensation costs last quarter needed to be balanced against the previous two quarters, when the gain was unusually small. ''The wage inflation picture is still benign,'' he said. **********Meanwhile, even though economic growth moderated significantly in the April-June quarter, there were plenty of signs of continued strength in the latest figures. **********The gross domestic product -- the nation's total output of goods and services -- expanded at a modest 2.3 percent annual pace, not much more than half the rate of last winter, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. **********The slowdown in growth was much more abrupt than forecasters had been expecting. **********American consumers, who had lately been doing so much of the world's buying, pulled back from their torrid 6.7 percent spending pace earlier in the year. But spending still advanced at a robust annual rate of 4 percent, with Americans digging deeper into debt by shopping more avidly than their gains in take-home pay could support. **********The trade deficit continued to serve as a drag on the economy, but it was a less severe brake than in recent periods. Spending on housing slowed considerably and so did the accumulation of inventories by American businesses. **********By contrast, business investment in equipment and buildings grew at a strong annual rate of 9.1 percent and computer purchases by businesses advanced at a blazing 41.5 percent annual rate. **********After two years of growth well in excess of the 2.5 to 3 percent rate the Fed deems sustainable over the long haul, the signs of moderation would normally have been cause for celebration on Wall Street. **********But instead it was the surprisingly large 1.1 percent jump in the Labor Department's employment cost index that created a commotion. **********Financial firms sharply raised bonuses while retailers, coping with labor shortages in many parts of the country, increased both pay and benefits. The second-quarter increase was the biggest spurt since the spring of 1991 and nearly three times the first quarter's tiny increase of four-tenths of 1 percent. **********Wages and salaries grew faster than fringe benefits, but benefit costs rose by nearly a percentage point in the spring. Costs for employer-provided health insurance had been remarkably tame in recent years, thanks to the pressure on most workers to shift to health maintenance organizations. But economists have been warning for some time that once the one-time savings have been achieved, health care costs will start rising faster. They now appear to be doing so. **********Investors have been worried that the Fed was preparing to initiate a series of rate increases to rein in the exuberant economy. The outsize spurt in labor costs seemed to confirm their anxieties. **********The economic picture, however, does not look as alarmingly different as the headline numbers on yesterday's reports made it seem. **********Take the labor cost data first. For one thing, the spurt in labor costs followed a puzzling slowdown last winter when the index barely rose even as unemployment dropped to its lowest level in three decades. For another, compensation costs for private industry are up just 3.3 percent from a year ago, less than the 3.5 percent rise the previous year. **********As of now, it is still possible that labor costs are simply catching up, and that the second quarter does not signal a new trend. ''Nobody will know for another few quarters whether the second quarter increase was an aberration,'' Mr. Perna said. **********Further, there was no evidence in yesterday's G.D.P. report that actual inflation was accelerating or that American corporations were finding it any easier to pass cost increases on to consumers. While import prices moved up sharply, the so-called G.D.P. deflator, which measures the prices of all domestically produced goods and services, rose at a tame 1.6 percent annual rate in the spring. **********By the same token, the economy still appears to have plenty of momentum. After the big blowout on cars and other big-ticket items, which was accompanied by a surge in borrowing, a slowdown was not only inevitable, but reassuring. **********Over all, the evidence seemed to point to a slight cooling off of the economy. ''Slower growth in consumption, housing and inventories,'' said Dean Baker, an economist at the Preamble Center, a liberal advocacy group in Washington, ''should eliminate any immediate concerns that the economy is growing at an unsustainable rate.'' **********But given the mixed picture, investors and analysts will focus on next Friday's release of July employment data. **********''The economy is moderating but the Fed is still on hair-trigger alert,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. ''Stay tuned.''"

''Everyone is in close contact with everyone else.'' **********Last week, the government of Guangdong province, which owns Guangdong Enterprises, abruptly announced that it would stop making interest payments on the debt. The provincial government's action came after the creditors rebuffed a complex proposal to overhaul Guangdong Enterprises. The plan called for the banks and the government to share the company's losses. **********Saying the loans were guaranteed by the provincial government, the banks demanded that Guangdong repay them by injecting an additional $1.8 billion of assets into the financially stricken company. **********The impasse underscores the gap between foreign lenders and government in China. As China sets out to overhaul its corporate sector, it is rewriting the rules on lending to companies. It is abandoning old practices that allowed banks to make cozy deals with provincial officials while paying little regard to creditworthiness. **********The banks are not accepting the new reality without a fight. Scarcely a day after Guangdong officials presented their plan to overhaul Guangdong Enterprises in May, the creditors dismissed it as inadequate. **********''The creditors are really being tough,'' said Andy Xie, a strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong. ''But they're not being realistic. This will go down to the wire, and the creditors will have to back off.'' **********The Chinese have not hesitated to take an uncompromising stance before. Last October, they forced another troubled state-owned company, Guangdong International Trust and Investment, or Gitic, into bankruptcy, after it sank under $4.3 billion in debt. Although the debts of Guangdong Enterprises are even larger, the Chinese officials say they believe it is worth saving. **********Salvaging Guangdong Enterprises is not the same as bailing it out, however. Under the terms of the provincial government's plan, the company's main Hong Kong subsidiary would be recapitalized by the grant of a profitable water business. Also, equity would be swapped for a portion of the company's debt. **********The creditors estimate that the proposal would result in 20 percent to 40 percent losses on their loans. Banks that lent money to the company's most troubled Hong Kong subsidiary, a food distribution company, Guangnan Holdings, could end up with losses of more than 50 percent. **********''The creditors disagree with the fundamental premise that the government and the banks should share the pain equally,'' said a person involved in the talks. ''They still feel the loans were guaranteed by the government.'' **********Although Chinese officials have taken a tough line, analysts say they cannot afford to alienate the banks. Foreign banks recoiled after Gitic was thrown into bankruptcy, and they cut off loans and raised the prospect of a credit shortage in China's already slowing economy. **********So far, the provincial government has tried hard to distinguish its treatment of Guangdong Enterprises from that of Gitic. Although it stopped paying off the company's debt in January, it continued making interest payments -- mostly as a good will gesture. The government also hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to draft a plan that would conform with international standards. **********Executives involved in the talks said the Chinese official overseeing the process, the Executive Vice Governor of Guangdong, Wang Qishan, had taken a political risk in proposing such a revamping of the debt. The pre-emptory dismissal by the banks put Mr. Wang in an awkward position, they said. **********''Wang Qishan had to sell to party officials in Beijing that he wanted to do this in a Western way,'' one executive said. ''Then he got a slap in the face by the creditors.'' **********China's decision to suspend interest payments is regarded by the creditors as a way for Mr. Wang to reassert his role. In what could be further pressure, rumors circulated here this week that the Chinese had prepared a plan to liquidate Guangdong Enterprises -- much as they did with Gitic."

Once the premier show in morning television, ''Good Morning America'' lost its lead to NBC's ''Today'' program in 1995 and has since declined precipitously in the Nielsen ratings, losing more than a quarter of its audience in two years. **********The morning programs are the most profitable news shows for ABC and NBC. Year-end figures are not yet available, but estimates compiled by Nielsen from network and advertising agency figures show that for the first half of 1998, ''Today'' earned about $117 million for NBC, a General Electric unit, while ''Good Morning America'' earned about $77 million for ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Company. **********These programs are also vital to each network's owned and affiliated stations. They split advertising time 50-50 with the networks but sustain almost none of the costs. And the programs help lead viewers to the rest of a station's morning programming. **********Mr. Westin acknowledged that ABC's stations had put pressure on the network to remedy whatever was wrong with ''Good Morning America.'' **********''We needed to make a very dramatic move,'' he said. **********For 1998, NBC's ''Today'' program averaged a 5.3 rating, while ''Good Morning America'' averaged 3.0, with each rating point representing 994,000 homes. ''CBS This Morning,'' the third network television morning show, averaged a 2.3 rating. **********The move yesterday stunned ABC News colleagues, who see Ms. Sawyer as one of the stars of prime-time news and Mr. Gibson as having finally escaped from an early-morning duty at which he had served long enough. **********''Neither one really needs this in their career right now,'' Mr. Westin said. ''But Charlie is deeply committed to the 'Good Morning America' franchise, and Diane is being a very loyal colleague and stepping up to help.'' **********Ms. Sawyer was co-host of the morning show for CBS News in the early 1980's, before joining ''60 Minutes'' and then moving to ABC. She said she would now cut back on assignments requiring travel, but otherwise planned ''to be fully part of the '20-20' team.'' **********''They'll just have to give me a lot of extra makeup for under my eyes,'' she remarked. **********Until this fall Ms. Sawyer and Sam Donaldson had co-anchored their own news magazine, ''Prime Time Live,'' on Wednesday nights. It was renamed ''20/20'' and joined that franchise, with Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs remaining the Friday night anchors and Ms. Walters and Ms. Sawyer on camera Sunday nights. **********Colleagues who insisted on anonymity said that in the ego-driven world of prime-time news, Ms. Sawyer had been unhappy about ''Prime Time Live'' being subsumed into ''20/20,'' long identified with Ms. Walters, and the ''Good Morning America'' role gives her a fresh and prominent identity, apart from Ms. Walters. **********It is also flattering, they said, to be regarded by top management as the potential savior of a program that is financially vital to the company. **********Ms. Sawyer excused herself early from yesterday's telephone news conference to catch a plane, and had no further comment. Mr. Gibson had just been named co-anchor, with Connie Chung, of the latest edition of ''20/20,'' on Monday nights, starting Feb. 1. He said yesterday that he would do that but would reduce the number of pieces he reported. **********Mr. Westin and both anchors said that no extra compensation or contract revisions had been made to induce them to take the new roles. **********But two of Ms. Sawyer's favorite producers were chosen to run ''Good Morning America.'' **********Shelley Ross, who recently produced Ms. Sawyer's exclusive interview with Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel pursuing President Clinton, was named executive producer of the program, replacing Shelley Lewis. And Phyllis McGrady, who had been executive producer of ''Prime Time Live'' for four years until it was folded into ''20/20,'' will be the ABC News management executive supervising the show. **********Mr. Westin said ABC News management, which has included him for 20 months, was to blame for the swift decline at ''Good Morning America,'' and that he did not expect recovery ''overnight.'' He said his two goals were to restore the program's ''core identity,'' which he said means a warmer, more family-like show, and to groom contributors for the next generation. **********The ''Today'' program has been very successful at gradually acclimating its viewers to new talent, both anchors and news readers. Matt Lauer, who replaced Bryant Gumbel as co-anchor with Katie Couric in 1997, filled in as an anchor in almost a third of the previous year's programs before taking over. **********By contrast, Mr. Newman came from almost total obscurity as an ABC News correspondent, and Ms. McRee was a Los Angeles local news anchor when she replaced Ms. Lunden. Mr. Westin said Ms. McRee would become a correspondent based in Los Angeles, in part because she is expecting her first child next summer and her husband lives there. **********Mr. Newman will become a correspondent for ''Nightline'' program of ABC News."

Team,CRISIS IN KOSOVO: THE MISSION; Yugoslavia Agrees to Visit by U.N. Team," **********Officials said today that Belgrade has agreed to let a United Nations mission visit Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, to assess relief needs, and the leader of an advance team representing several agencies left immediately for Belgrade. **********Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, announced that the trip was on after Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's representative here, delivered a letter welcoming the mission and assuring that Belgrade would facilitate the trip. **********The advance team is to discuss arrangements for the arrival of the main mission of about 15 relief groups, which will visit Kosovo; it is expected to arrive in Yugoslavia by mid-May. **********Earlier this week Secretary General Kofi Annan proposed that an emergency mission visit Yugoslavia to assess ''the magnitude of the problem'' and ''prepare the ground for the refugees to go back to Kosovo.'' There was immediate skepticism from Russia, Britain and the United States. **********Diplomats said that Moscow wanted assurances that such a mission would include not just an assessment of the damage in Kosovo, but also the damage to Serbs and Yugoslavia's infrastructure from allied bombing. At the same time, the United States and Britain expressed concern that such a mission might suggest that NATO was willing to halt its air strikes, which, they stressed, it is not. **********Western officials reacted coolly to the announcement today. One official said that the timing of the proposed mission was not ''ideal'' from NATO's standpoint. Another Western envoy said he was concerned that President Slobodan Milosevic would try to manipulate the mission for propaganda purposes. **********United Nations officials said Mr. Annan had written a letter today to Javier Solana, NATO's Secretary General, informing him of the mission and presumably seeking assurances that NATO's fighter planes would avoid targeting the mission's convoy as it traveled through Yugoslavia. But Mr. Annan told reporters he had not asked for a pause in the bombing and suggested that he was prepared to proceed without explicit public assurances from NATO."

I enjoy using computers, and even own two of them. But when it comes to CD-ROM cookbooks, I still need persuading. **********You will understand my bias if you consider this: suppose you have carried home your new $30 hardcover copy of ''Joy of Cooking,'' and you have opened it to the recipe for Brunswick stew, an old Southern recipe that I have actually used several times. You have begun to prepare the dish and -- oops -- you've spilled a spoonful of bacon fat on the pages. Well, these things happen. Unstained cookbooks are unused cookbooks. From now on, the recipe for Brunswick stew will be easy to find: the page is indelibly marked. **********Now imagine instead that you have carried home your new $20 Joy of Cooking CD-ROM. You switch on the computer, wait for it to boot up, install the program and use the Find function to call up the recipe for Brunswick stew. You begin to prepare the dish and -- oops -- there goes that bacon fat again. These things happen, except $2,000 computers are considerably less forgiving than $30 books when it comes to bacon fat. In fact, they are remarkably intolerant of spills of any kind. **********That, of course, might never happen. Does anybody, after all, have a computer in the kitchen? Unlike conventional cookbooks, cooking CD-ROM's are not kitchen tools. They are reference books for the library. If you are going to use a recipe from a computerized cookbook, you will probably print it out first, provided that, unlike me, you have a printer. Then, even if you drop the fat, the recipe will be protected in the computer. All you've damaged is the printout. **********A computerized cookbook clearly requires a different set of instincts. For example, I like to browse through cookbooks until something catches my eye. Opening up ''Joy of Cooking'' to Brunswick stew, I can't help but notice the recipe immediately before it, for country captain, another old-fashioned braised chicken dish that I haven't thought about for ages. Flipping pages, I land by chance on a section describing the characteristics of fish and learn that the black cod is the same as the sable, which I never knew. **********By contrast, to find the recipe for Brunswick stew on the CD-ROM, I must go directly there. The only opportunity for detour is a brief essay on chicken fricassees, stews and other braised dishes. That will indeed give me the opportunity to click on country captain, along with chicken cacciatore, chicken chile verde and a dozen other recipes. But it takes an act of will, not chance, to get there, and I won't end up learning about black cod, either. **********The real value of these CD-ROM's is in harnessing the organizing power of the computer and applying it to the stuff of cooking. CD-ROM cookbooks not only offer recipes, they also accept your own. If you have the patience to type your personal set of recipes into a computer, these CD-ROM's will arrange them for you, let you print them out and analyze their nutritional values. No longer will you have tattered, stained and dog-eared recipes, clipped from some defunct magazines, sticking haphazardly out of cookbooks like so many loose ends. What's more, the CD-ROM's will also organize shopping lists for you, refigure recipes depending on the number of servings you desire, offer menu suggestions and even search for recipes that meet your stated criteria. **********Of course, these functions are not all welcomed by everybody. Some of us prefer tattered, dog-eared recipes and shopping lists scrawled on the backs of old envelopes. We have no use for a function that searches for recipes that can be cooked in less than an hour because that's not how we decide what to cook. We don't want a computer's menu suggestions. **********I suppose somebody like that might be described as a Luddite after all. At least I won't spill anything on my computer."

Wish lists, complete with sizes, can be posted on the Web.","E-Commerce Report; Letters to Santa are no longer necessary. Wish lists, complete with sizes, can be posted on the Web."," **********ELECTRONIC-COMMERCE companies have long been accused of wishful thinking. Now they're selling it. **********Wishlist.com, Wishclick.com and OhIWish.com have joined a lineup of other e-commerce start-ups in the suddenly cluttered field of online gift registries, where people post lists of their preferred gifts in hopes that friends and family members will take their not-so-subtle hints. **********The element of wishful thinking in this trend goes beyond the obvious pun, however. For these sites to succeed, they will have to convince consumers to scrap the traditional mode of receiving mystery gifts gracefully -- no matter how awful they are -- and instead announce to the world exactly what gifts they want, down to the sizes, colors and retailers. **********Purveyors of gift registry sites argue that consumers are ready to make that change -- are prepared, in effect, to push gift giving closer to a barter exchange, as in ''give me this, and I'll give you that.'' But they also acknowledge that consumers will need a bit of monetary incentive to test this new approach. And the amounts gift registries are shelling out to users are testimony to just how much they and their e-commerce partners stand to gain if this bit of consumer behavior can be altered. **********Until now, online gift registries have been confined to wedding sites -- like The Knot and Williams-Sonoma's Wedding and Gift Registry -- or specific retailers like Recreational Equipment Inc. -- better known as REI -- and Crate and Barrel. In recent months, however, several all-occasion registry sites have emerged that amass products from multiple retailers. **********Typically, users post their wish lists on the registry site, which offer different mechanisms to disseminate the lists to friends and family -- an e-mail greeting card is the most common approach. For instance, on Della.com, which last week expanded from a wedding registry to an all-occasion site, users send e-mail greeting cards to potential gift givers with messages like ''All modesty aside, here's what I want,'' and ''Here's what I sent to Santa . . . hint, hint'' along with their lists. **********Gift buyers can then either come directly to the gift registry site to buy the goods, or follow links to retailers affiliated with the registry. When an item is bought, the purchaser is usually responsible for eliminating that item from the list on the registry site. **********One of the most well-financed companies in this category, Della.com offers items from eight well-known retailers, including the Gap, REI and Amazon.com, which owns a 20 percent stake in the company. It has plans to have 50 retailers by mid-2000. Users click on items on the site to add them to a ''wish center,'' a page on Della.com's site that lists a person's wishes and general hobbies, clothing sizes and favorite colors. Or, they can select an item from far-flung Web retailers and post the item's address on the list. Once someone has purchased a gift, he or she can delete the item from the list. **********For retailers and registries, at least, there is a lot to like about this approach to gift buying. The gift registries collect a referral fee from retailers each time someone buys a gift from a retail partner. Those fees -- in the range of 5 to 15 percent -- mirror those of affiliate programs, whereby sites make money by sending customers to e-commerce partners. But because registry sites include multiple retailers, that money can quickly amount to meaningful revenue. Retailers, meanwhile, acquire customers for a fraction of what they pay through other means, like advertising or paid placement on Yahoo, Lycos or other portal sites. **********Retailers have also embraced the idea because it helps reduce one of their biggest headaches: returns. Internet retailers who continue to struggle with fulfillment issues exult at the prospect of shipping a package with a virtual guarantee that it will not be dropped back on their doorstep a week later. **********Beyond that, gift registries collect data about specific items that consumers want; the sites can then share that information with retailers and marketers if users agree to allow it. Even if consumers do not agree to share their personal information, however, registry sites can collect statistics about what products their customers like, giving them bargaining leverage with potential retail partners and advertisers. **********The attraction for consumers, industry executives say, is that the services make buying gifts easier. **********''The reason why it'll catch on is that it solves a fundamental problem,'' said Rebecca Patton, chief executive of Della.com. ''People want to buy better gifts.'' **********Like other gift registries, Della.com faces two basic obstacles to instant consumer adoption: getting customers to register and getting them to circulate their wish lists. And like other gift registries, Della.com has a simple strategy to overcome those hurdles: money. Those who create a Della.com wish list are entered into a weekly sweepstakes for $2,300 worth of items they have registered for, and those who send their wish lists to 10 people to Della.com receive a $10 gift certificate for purchases at Amazon.com. **********Wishclick.com, meanwhile, gives users a $50 gift certificate when they persuade 10 people to register on the site -- and those people get $10 gift certificates for joining. IveBeenGood.com gives users a $25 gift certificate for sending their list to five people. **********Online registry executives admit that money will only get them so far -- particularly this holiday season. ''I think it'll be a while before lots of people register for their birthdays and send the list to everybody they know,'' said Ms. Patton, of Della.com. ''Right now, this is usually initiated by the person who's buying the gift, so this builds on existing behavior. So this season will be for introducing people to it. Next year it'll grow.'' **********Ravi Gururaj, president of IveBeenGood, is slightly more bullish. ''Our research shows that consumers are yearning for technology like this,'' he said. ''I think it's like e-commerce in general. We'll see a certain amount of growth this Christmas, but next year it'll be almost ubiquitous.'' **********Registry executives also said the rate of adoption would be increased by well-known e-commerce sites, like eToys and Victoria's Secret, that have added wish list features on their own. Noting that Amazon.com also just added a wish list feature, Scott Sangster, chief executive of Wishclick.com, said that ''almost 100 percent of consumers somehow create a wish list -- be it verbally, written or e-mailed.'' **********''So they get it,'' he said. ''Now they're just looking to improve on the process.'' **********Analysts tend to agree. ''These sites are viable, there's no question,'' said David Sanderson, head of Bain & Company's e-commerce practice. The practice of consumers registering for wedding and baby gifts ''is absolutely transferable to other events,'' he said, adding, ''The reason people shop online is convenience, so if there is a more convenient way of dealing with gifts, customers will come and they will respond to that.''"

Under the terms of the Oslo peace accord, May 4 was a target date by which final peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians were to have been completed, but they have barely begun. **********The meeting over the fate of the state will resume in June, after the Israeli elections, which will be held on May 17 with a runoff expected on June 1. **********That way, if the right-wing Government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is re-elected and the peace effort remains frozen, the Palestinians can reconsider the option of  making a unilateral declaration of statehood, some said. **********''We decided to give ourselves an open-ended session because we don't want to let any decision serve Netanyahu and the Israeli groups that are fighting peace,'' Abdallah Frangi, a council member and Palestine Liberation Organization representative to Germany, told The Associated Press in Gaza. **********Palestinian leaders said that they were uneasy that Mr. Netanyahu would trumpet the postponement as a victory for his tough posture toward them. And indeed he did, even before their meeting ended, both in statements to the press and in hastily prepared political advertisements. **********''Arafat backed down and that's a good thing,'' Mr. Netanyahu said on Wednesday. ''They delayed it until after the election because they know that as long as I am Prime Minister of Israel, a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital will not be established.'' **********Mr. Arafat convened the Gaza meeting to allow some outlet for the impatience many in the Palestine Liberation Organization feel with the slow road to independence. He also wanted a broad consensus for his temperate, pragmatic decision after raising his people's hopes in a series of fiery speeches over the last year. **********Frustrated, some Palestinian leaders would prefer to abandon the American-brokered peace effort, by which their sovereignty or statehood is to be determined through negotiations with Israel. **********But after the Americans promised early this week to help him push for a final negotiated deal within a year, Mr. Arafat urged the Palestinian leadership to be patient. He referred to the trappings of statehood -- from an airport to a country area code -- that the Palestinians have recently acquired. And he reportedly told them that it was a sensitive moment, when the Palestinians, having accomplished much, should not risk losing what they have gained by ''making mistakes.'' **********Reporting on a whirlwind diplomatic tour, Mr. Arafat and his advisers made it clear that they had gained international support for independence -- good will and backing that the Palestinians will need in negotiating the thorny issues involved in final status talks. **********But Mr. Arafat told the council members that the Americans, many Europeans and some Arab leaders had asked them not to make a unilateral declaration of statehood next week so as not to rupture the peace process or to provoke retaliation by the Israelis. In the event of a declaration, Israel had threatened a harsh reaction, including possibly annexing swaths of the West Bank."

Bacon. But he added that the Serb authorities ''are mobilizing vehicles and other means to transport people out.'' **********''We've certainly seen preparations for moving out,'' Mr. Bacon told reporters, noting that the Yugoslav chief of staff, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, said over the weekend that a peace deal would allow soldiers to go home to their families. **********But the Pentagon offered no other details indicating that the Serbs were moving toward withdrawal. **********Fighting has continued along the border with Albania. The Pentagon said Serbian forces had become vulnerable to attack in recent days, as they massed while withdrawing from defensive positions. On Sunday two battalions were hit by 500-pound unguided bombs, the Pentagon said, and a Pentagon official said hundreds of the troops might have been killed and wounded. **********In the bombing on Sunday, NATO B-52's caught two Yugoslav Army battalions in the open near Mount Pastrik, and bombed them, Mr. Bacon said. **********While there are signs of a Yugoslav withdrawal, an allied spokesman in Brussels, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, said that Serbian units from the interior appeared to be moving with heavy equipment to reinforce units already positioned near Albania. **********Serbian forces lobbed shells into Albanian territory today at numerous spots, and heavy fighting was reported near Mount Pastrik and Junik, General Jertz said. **********Allied leaders warned President Slobodan Milosevic that the NATO bombing, scaled back after the peace deal announced on Thursday but then intensified after the Yugoslavs broke off military talks, would continue. **********Before military talks started again in Macedonia tonight, the allies stepped up the pressure on Mr. Milosevic, ratcheting up strikes against strategic targets in Serbia overnight Monday. Allied warplanes bombed oil storage yards at Novi Sad and Pancevo and the Batjnica airfield outside Belgrade. **********''All of this depends on Mr. Milosevic's accepting the terms of the military technical agreement, and abiding by it,'' Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said in Brussels today. **********Ms. Albright traveled to Brussels to brief the NATO military commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, and the Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, on the agreement on a draft Security Council resolution reached today in Cologne by the United States, Russia and six other  industrialized nations. **********The draft agreement asks for United Nations blessing, but makes clear that the NATO peacekeeping force will take orders only from a British officer, Lieut. Gen. Michael Jackson, according to allied officials here. **********Allied officials said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and a State Department military adviser, Lieut. Gen. Robert H. Foglesong, would open talks with Russian officers in Moscow on Wednesday to work out a way for Russian troops to join the peacekeepers. **********The Pentagon is wary about how Russia might play a role in Kosovo, but General Foglesong, who is the top assistant to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will make the Pentagon's views known. **********The first of nearly 50,000 NATO peacekeepers are to begin moving into Kosovo within days of a final agreement. The peacekeeping force, known as KFOR and nearly the size of the one that entered Bosnia, which is much larger, in 1995, will divide the province into five sectors, each overseen by one of NATO's five largest members: the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy. **********A European force of 16,600 soldiers now in Macedonia under General Jackson's command will likely enter Kosovo first, Mr. Bacon said today, followed by the first of 7,000 American troops. **********About 1,900 marines now aboard ships in the Aegean and 1,700 Army soldiers in Albania would link up near the Macedonia border with Kosovo, and move in behind the European troops, within 72 to 96 hours of an order to move out, Mr. Bacon said. **********The Americans will set up a headquarters in Gnjilane, in southeastern Kosovo, initially under the command of Brig. Gen. John Craddock. **********These American ''enabling forces,'' as the overall initial entry force is called, would include infantrymen from the 82d Airborne Division, four Cobra and eight Apache helicopter gunships, 105-millimeter howitzers, Bradley fighting vehicles and M1-A1 Abrams tanks. The Apache gunships, though stationed there for two months, were not used in combat because the Pentagon feared that they were vulnerable to air defense systems. **********Additional Army forces will arrive from Germany to fill out the United States complement. **********As peacekeepers go in, their first task will be clear land mines and booby-traps left by Yugoslav troops. Under the agreement, the Yugoslavs are to help identify minefields and possibly help clear them. **********Overall, NATO's job is to provide a secure environment to allow the return to their homes of upwards of a million ethnic Albanians Mr. Milosevic's forces expelled from the province. **********''We anticipate that 50 percent of all the refugees will want to return quickly and to be home well before the end of the summer,'' said a NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea. **********But many Pentagon officials are more wary. ''This is going to be a daunting mission,'' Mr. Bacon said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-the-men-missing-refugees-turn-up-with-accounts-of-abuse.html,Ian Fisher,1999-05-30,"About 2,300 ethnic Albanian men from Kosovo have crossed border into Albania in last week; many say they were beaten by Serbian forces; map; photos (M)",1496,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Missing Refugees Turn Up With Accounts of Abuse,CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE MEN; Missing Refugees Turn Up With Accounts of Abuse," **********What happened to the thousands of ethnic Albanian men -- from boys barely of fighting age to grandfathers -- who were separated from their families in recent weeks in Kosovo, shoved into trucks and who then disappeared? **********A partial answer to one of the scarier questions in the devastation of Kosovo has been staggering across the border here. **********The fear was that the men were killed by Serbian militias, and perhaps some were. But in the last week, about 2,300 men crossed the border into Albania, most unshaven, some weeping, with no money or belts around pants that have recently grown baggier. **********Beslim Selimi, 38, came on Friday with his feet purple from beatings, a black left eye, marks on his back left by rifle butts and hands swollen as if he had frostbite. **********''One of my neighbors, a Serb, was the one who beat me,'' he said. ''He wanted to kill me but the others wouldn't let him.'' **********Like all the accounts of the men who came across the border this week, Mr. Selimi's remarks could not be independently verified. But the individual accounts, given separately over several days, suggested that the men were routinely subjected to interrogation and some to beatings. Those tactics have been hallmarks of the tough police hand with which the Serbs have ruled Kosovo since stripping it of broad autonomy in 1989. According to many Kosovo Albanian men, such detentions and beatings have increased since the spring of 1998, when the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian security forces began heightened battles for control of the province. **********The men who arrived in the last  week all said they were held prisoner at a notorious jail in Smrekovnica, north of Kosovo's capital, Pristina. The men said they were beaten, stripped of their identification cards and given little to eat. A sign there, painted recently, reads: ''Welcome to Alcatraz.'' **********But the most chilling detail is the confession many said they were forced to sign saying that they were members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group fighting Serbian forces in Kosovo. With the stroke of a pen, without having to kill anyone, the Serbs had a piece of paper giving them an excuse to expel any Kosovar Albanian with no right ever to come back. **********''Now they have all these documents, but we were forced to sign,'' said Shyqri Qeliku, 35, who said he was held for nearly two weeks before being released on Friday morning. ''The Serbs can use these documents to say we were all in the K.L.A.'' **********The men's accounts suggest that Serbian officials, in essence, are cycling Albanians through the prison -- and at least one other closer to Macedonia, officials from the United Nations refugee agency say -- as yet another means to purge Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. Refugee officials agree, adding that stripping them of their identification cards seemed aimed at making any return to Kosovo that much harder. **********''It's going to be a huge problem, even if things pan out,'' said an official. ''Down at the micro level, in the villages, they can say: This guy never lived here.'' **********Another problem, according to Rupert Colville of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here, is that in at least one case, a Serbian policeman tried to retaliate against the brother of a prisoner who was interviewed about his experience on Italian television. The policeman, who sought the brother at the prison, failed to find him, but in anger beat another prisoner, Mr. Colville said, citing an account from a released prisoner. **********According to the accounts of the men who have arrived here, Serbian police officers at the prison also seemed bent on extracting as much information as possible about the Kosovo Liberation Army, which Western military analysts say has been on the offensive in and making some gains on the ground. **********''They kept asking: 'Are you a soldier in the K.L.A.?' '' said Ekrem Halili, 38, from the city of Mitrovica, just north of the prison. Mr. Halili said that as the police beat the men, they asked: ''Do you know them? Who are the commanders of the K.L.A.?'' Even with false confessions, presumably the Serbs have managed to extract some genuine information about the rebels from the thousands of men who have been interrogated at the prison since the start of May. **********The first prisoners who were released -- gaunt figures who showed up at the border crossing in Morini in Albania last Saturday -- said they had been taken to the jail on May 2. A man who would only give his name as Zena, a 45-year-old engineer, said that on that day Serbian soldiers came to the village of Kqiq i Madh, not far from the prison, and ordered all ethnic Albanians to form convoys to head toward Albania. **********They did so, and Zena gathered with his three brothers and family that amounted to 40 people. **********''After half an hour they took all the men out and they took us to another place and they started to beat us,'' Zena said. ''They said, 'You are all terrorists.' They even said it to 14-year-olds and 80-year-olds.'' One man in his group was deaf, he said, ''and they said to him that he was a terrorist.'' **********The vast range of ages of those held prisoner has been evident in the stream across the border this week. **********He said they were carted into trucks and taken to the prison, described by others as a chilly old concrete building with several cell blocks and a short wall surrounding it. Many men said they were not fed for the first several days, and later were given a little bread and occasionally an egg or cheese. **********Musli Hyseni, 20 years old, said he was herded into a room with a television along with 600 other people. The prisoners, he said, were not allowed to use the toilet for two days. **********Mr. Hyseni, who used to work at a car wash, said nearly everyone in that room was beaten, he himself on four different days. At one point, he and 60 other men were separated out from the main group and forced to kneel down, with their faces against the concrete floor and their fingers laced behind their necks. He said they stayed in that position for four hours, which human rights groups say is an extremely painful form of torture. **********All the while, he said, police officers asked what they knew about the rebel army. ''I didn't have anything to tell them,'' said Mr. Hyseni, who like most prisoners, denied any connection with the guerrilla force. ''I knew nothing.'' **********Several of the men interviewed said that the police officers also forced prisoners to fight each other, sometimes pitting father against son or brother against brother. **********''They just took us out into the hallway and said, 'Come on, beat each other up and just pretend you have a Serb in front of you,' '' said Shevqet Hoxha, a 48-year-old factory worker from Mitrovica who was forced to fight another prisoner whom he did not know. ''And when I didn't hit hard enough, the policeman beat me.'' The two men, who left the prison and crossed the border together, are now friends. **********Some men reported that fellow prisoners disappeared, but they were unable to give further details and the scant accounts suggested the disappearances did not occur in great numbers. Only one prisoner interviewed said he saw anyone being killed, which he said happened during a beating with police batons that he said he saw from perhaps 100 feet away through the window of his cell. **********The prison reportedly holds about 3,000 people, and each day, the prisoners said, new groups of men were brought to the jail. Then on May 22, the police began calling out names and put several hundred people on buses. ''We didn't know where they were going to take us,'' Mr. Hyseni said. ''I didn't think they would free us. I thought they were going to take us to another prison and kill us.'' **********But they arrived at the border, and every day since, another group of men in groups of several hundred at a time have walked across several pounds lighter, many stripped of everything they own, down to watches and rings, shoelaces and belts. Many said they were astounded that the Serbs let them live. **********''We were all waiting for death,'' said Zena's brother Bajra. ''To go on, it is like being reborn.'' **********But, like many others, he said he cannot feel happy because he believes his family is still inside Kosovo. ''I am very, very bad,'' a 39-year-old man said, hours after he was released on Thursday. ''I don't know anything about my family.'' **********As he made his way down the border road to food and a bus ride to the refugee camps, he insisted that he was not a rebel. But 10 days in prison may have changed things. **********''I just want three or four days to rest,'' he said. ''Then I'm going to join the K.L.A.''"

The share values of both companies have risen since then, and the offer is now worth more than $148 billion. **********The British company has said that it will make a formal takeover offer to Mannesmann shareholders by Dec. 24. Both companies have been aggressively lobbying with shareholders for support in a struggle that could alter the landscape of European telecommunications. **********Executives close to Mannesmann said that under the current terms of Vodafone's offer, the German company will press ahead with its defense plans. They emphasized that despite the views of a faction of Mannesmann management that favors considering an offer including a cash component, they do not expect Vodafone to make another overture. And they declined to estimate how much cash this faction would want. **********Vodafone has said it will pay Mannesmann stockholders 53.7 of its shares for each Mannesmann share. **********Klaus Esser, chief executive of Mannesmann, is philosophically opposed to any offer, with or without cash, the executives said. **********Mr. Esser has previously stated that Mannesmann is worth at least 33 percent more than Vodafone is currently offering. **********A spokesman for Mannesmann declined to comment on possible dissension among the company's management. Vodafone also declined to comment. **********But executives close to Vodafone said the British company was still willing to negotiate with Mannesmann. **********Vodafone is expected to make its formal offer under German takeover codes, which are more lenient and allow for Vodafone to raise its offer, unlike British takeover regulations, which effectively bind bidders to their original offer. **********Once Vodafone has made its offer, it can keep that proposal on the table for 28 to 60 days. The executives close to Vodafone suggested that the company would leave its offer open until mid-to-late February. **********While Christopher Gent, chief executive of Vodafone, has repeatedly said that his company's offer is final, making the offer under German regulations allows for the possibility that negotiations between the two telecommunications companies could take place. **********Vodafone has repeatedly sought to portray its offer as friendly, though Mannesmann has rebuffed all the overtures. Mr. Esser insists that Mannesmann's business strategy is completely different from Vodafone's and that a tie-up of the two companies would lead to slower growth than if Mannesmann remains independent. **********In presentations to investors, Mr. Esser has said that his company's growth is based on a combination of communications methods including land-line networks, data networks and wireless networks, while Vodafone's strategy is to stick to its wireless business. **********Last week, Mr. Esser said, ''It is difficult to see potential in further talks.'' He added, ''There is no strategic incentive for Mannesmann to combine with Vodafone.'' **********Analysts, though, said a sweetened cash offer could make a deal more palatable to investors who are nervous that an all-stock deal carries too much volatility. Most analysts interviewed thought that it was too soon to declare a winner and that investors will generally wait to see Vodafone's formal offering documents and Mannesmann's formal response before making up their minds. **********Vodafone shares rose 2.4 percent today to $:3.0625, or $4.93. Mannesmann shares edged up 2 euros to 225.50 euros, or $229.24. The shares of both companies had been largely unchanged most of the week, having risen considerably since Vodafone first announced its hostile bid."

He was represented by a prestigious gallery, some of his paintings were selling for more than $100,000 each and the Museum of Modern Art gave him a one-man show. **********His investments, though, were not as stellar as his art. **********Methodical as an artist, he was as impulsive and haphazard as any amateur when it came to choosing stocks. **********''I did what everybody else did -- I got tips from friends,'' Mr. Sultan, 48, said recently, sitting in a book-lined office in the rear of his Spartan loft in TriBeCa. **********In the studio, two assistants were preparing the linoleum tiles on which he applies tar, the first step toward his trademark images of flowers, egg shapes and smoke rings. **********''I had a friend, and he told me what to buy,'' Mr. Sultan said of his investments. **********''I bought a bunch of stuff. Then the stuff went down in value. I called him and he said, 'Oh, I sold mine.' He wasn't a broker or anything, and he said, 'I can't take care of your money.' '' **********Mr. Sultan panicked. ''I knew I needed someone'' to take charge, he said. After all, he had a family to help provide for, and he saw his limitations as an investor. ''But I didn't know how to find the right person,'' he added. **********Then in the spring of 1992, he stumbled upon a solution. He was introduced to Fayez Sarofim, the Houston-based art collector and legendary investor, who was managing about $28 billion and had accumulated a personal fortune that Forbes magazine estimated at more than $600 million. **********''I had heard about Fayez from a friend who had invested with him,'' Mr. Sultan said. ''When the market crashed in 1987, this friend called and asked Fayez what to do, and Fayez said, 'Go fishing.' **********''I liked his answer, because I am someone who panics, and I wanted someone who would say that,'' Mr. Sultan added. **********MR. SAROFIM, an Egyptian-born investor who came to this country as a young man, approaches investing with much the same philosophy as Warren E. Buffett: Buy carefully and hold. His firm, Fayez Sarofim & Company, invests for individuals and is also the adviser for four mutual funds: three for Dreyfus and one for Global Asset Management. Whether buying paintings or stocks, he goes for established, brand-name properties, and he hangs on to them for years, selling reluctantly. **********In a rare interview over lunch at the private Coronado Club in Houston, the slightly disheveled and somewhat shy Mr. Sarofim described his investment strategy metaphorically. ''Most people have the idea of finding a needle in a haystack; they miss the objective of going for the haystack,'' Mr. Sarofim said. ''I buy the haystack'' -- proven companies like Philip Morris, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. **********''I like the ones that have been screened,'' Mr. Sarofim explained. ''You only live so long. Why eat green bananas?'' **********He has also loaded up on the works of a brand-name roster of artists, including Donald Sultan. ''The first painting I bought was by a lady in Houston,'' Mr. Sarofim said. ''It was $300, and I enjoyed looking at it. But it is still worth $300. At the time, it was all I could afford.'' **********Later, when he could afford more, he bought a painting by the American Impressionist Childe Hassam for $1,100. ''I sold it at $25,000,'' Mr. Sarofim continued, speaking softly. ''Today it is worth $400,000. Hassam was a known quantity. The value of the painting went up. My biggest mistake was selling.'' **********Mr. Sarofim, 70, still owns his first Sultan work, which he acquired soon before the men first met, when Mr. Sultan visited Houston in the spring of 1992 for a one-man show at the Meredith Long gallery. **********Since the two men had expressed an interest in being introduced, Mr. Long, widely considered Houston's leading dealer, took Mr. Sultan to Mr. Sarofim's offices, where paintings by Helen Frankenthaler, Frank Stella and Roy Lichtenstein crowded the walls. **********Over lunch, as Mr. Sultan and Mr. Sarofim indulged a shared passion for cigars, the talk turned to stocks. The artist told the investor how, on the advice of a friend, he had sold some shares of Abbott Laboratories to take a profit. **********''Fayez winced, and I said, 'Why are you wincing?' '' recalled Mr. Sultan, who still speaks with the slight Southern drawl of his native North Carolina. **********''He said, 'You had a very smart friend who advised you to buy the stock, and you should not have sold it,' '' Mr. Sultan said. ''Then I grew panicked again.'' **********After lunch, Mr. Sultan returned with Mr. Sarofim to his offices. The desk and the floor around the investor's feet were piled high with a jumble of documents. **********''He looked like he was a guy merged with the flow of capital around the world,'' Mr. Sultan said. **********As they talked, ''Fayez was watching monitors and running this huge investment company,'' Mr. Sultan recalled. ''I thought I would be kind of silly if I didn't ask. What did I have to lose? So I asked if he would take care of my money, and he said yes. And I said, 'It isn't very much.' He told me it didn't matter.'' **********Mr. Sultan, who declined to put a figure on his wealth, was well aware that at that time he was not in the same bracket as most of Mr. Sarofim's clients; they generally give  him discretion over portfolios of $1 million or more. **********As for Mr. Sarofim, though he had met other artists in the course of his collecting, ''no one had ever asked me to manage their money before,'' he said. ''It surprised me.'' **********IN fact, such relationships -- or at least more informal ones between artists and investment professionals -- are not at all unusual, though one is more likely to evolve when artists are better established, and when they have known a collector for years. ''The odd thing about Donald, as far as I am concerned, is that he did it early on,'' said Irving Blum, who was a co-owner of the Blum Hellman Gallery in New York, which represented Mr. Sultan in the 1980's but has since closed. **********One of the perks of being an artist, of course, is the access it can provide to luminaries in other fields. ''Artists are glamour people, and money people go out of their way to help them,'' one leading dealer said. ''It is only possible for successful artists. They provide the ego gratification to the money people.'' **********In 1971, when Roy Lichtenstein was in his late 40's and his paintings were selling for large sums, he became friendly with Robert J. Denison, a hedge fund manager with First Security as well as a collector, over tennis games in Southampton, N.Y. ''Roy began to ask me questions about investing, and I recommended stocks,'' Mr. Denison recalled. ''He had an extremely curious mind. But he never paid me for investment advice. I didn't want to cross that line.'' **********Kenneth Noland, the color-field artist probably best known for his paintings of circles, recalls getting informal -- and valuable -- investment advice from the well-known investor Leon Levy, now chairman of the Oppenheimer Management Corporation's New York-based funds. The two men are friends and neighbors in Westchester County. **********What helped give Mr. Sultan confidence in Mr. Sarofim was the investor's reputation as something of a recluse, obsessed with his work. **********''There are guys who manage money for artists who want to be part of the scene,'' Mr. Sultan said. ''They make me nervous. I always have the feeling that they will end up in Bermuda on drugs with your money.'' **********Mr. Sarofim was not a fixture on Houston's social scene, nor was he known to spend time hobnobbing with artists on his periodic visits to New York. He also did not treat Mr. Sultan any differently from his wealthier clients. **********''I think of managing his money as trying to protect him from himself,'' Mr. Sarofim said. ''Most people get into danger because they have too much energy. What we all want is to save money so we can have security in our old age. But very few people can handle money. It makes them impulsive. One businessman listens to another. They buy on tips.'' **********Mr. Sarofim is particularly cautious about selling stocks because of tax consequences. ''If you have $1 that compounds at 15 percent, in 20 years it will be worth $16.37,'' he said. ''If you trade $1 that makes 15 percent, in the same period it will be worth $5.02,'' as capital gains taxes and transaction costs diminish the profit. **********Mr. Sarofim tends to hold stocks for years, selling as rarely as possible, a strategy that minimizes capital gains taxes and expenses. The biggest mutual fund he manages, the $4.8 billion Dreyfus Appreciation fund, has a turnover rate of just 1 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. Other funds in Morningstar's large blend category (meaning funds that own both growth and value-oriented stocks with larger market capitalizations) turn over 79 percent of their portfolios, on average, in a given year. **********THOUGH Mr. Sultan wasn't always the most patient investor, he fell under the spell of Mr. Sarofim's buy-and-hold formula. **********''I don't think anybody ever makes any money buying and selling stock,'' Mr. Sultan said. ''They have to make money by keeping the stock.'' **********Still, he used to love to watch the television program ''Moneyline News Hour'' for its accounts of daily trading action. But ''I didn't think there was a word of truth ever spoken on it,'' Mr. Sultan said. **********Just as investing in brand-name artists or stocks gives Mr. Sarofim some security, Mr. Sultan has felt secure enough with his brand-name money manager to hand over his finances and concentrate on his work. **********After all, Mr. Sarofim has a proven track record. He does not release numbers on his performance for private clients. But on average, since he began managing Dreyfus Appreciation in 1990, the fund has returned 20.04 percent a year, through Aug. 20. That compares with 18.32 percent, on average, for the universe of large blend funds tracked by Morningstar, ranking it 53rd among the 155 such funds that have existed for the entire period. **********It has, however, lagged behind the broader market: the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen an average of 21.2 percent annually in the period. **********Mr. Sultan's own income has its ebbs and flows. He weathered the art-market downturn of the early 1990's, and with the recent recovery, some of his works are again selling for six figures. To make the best of what he has, he turns to Mr. Sarofim for advice. **********''Before I went with Fayez, I had picked some stocks myself,'' Mr. Sultan said. He had mimicked many individual investors by buying companies that he and his family -- his wife, Susan Reynolds Sultan, a film producer and screenwriter; daughter, Frances, now 18, and son, Penn, now 11 -- were familiar with. ''I bought the Gap because that is where the kids shop, and I bought Disney. And the Gap didn't do anything, so I called him and said: 'What should I do? Maybe we should sell it.' Fayez didn't think so because it was the best retailing stock. The next day, it started to go up. **********''I bought some zero-coupon bonds for the kids. I bought one for my daughter and one for my son, to help pay for their schooling. So Fayez said: 'Sell some bonds.' '' Over the years, Mr. Sarofim pointed out to him, stocks have produced a better rate of return. So Mr. Sultan sold half of the bonds he had bought for himself, but he kept the other half, as a hedge, as well as the bonds for the children's education. **********The two men have become good friends and generally spend time together when Mr. Sarofim is in New York or when both are in Aspen, Colo., skiing with their children. **********Their work styles have more in common than is initially apparent. **********Mr. Sultan may be a panicky investor, but his painstaking, complex technique as an artist makes it impossible to complete a picture quickly. He works by applying tar, plaster, rubber and, finally, color to linoleum tiles -- a process that gives his starkly simple paintings richness and density. It also means that a single painting can take up to a month, so that Mr. Sultan's annual output is 12 to 18 paintings, though he also makes prints and works on paper. ''He produces a relatively small number of paintings,'' said Ann Freedman, president of Knoedler & Company in New York, the gallery that now handles Mr. Sultan's work. **********Like many professionals, Mr. Sultan has little time to educate himself on finances, and his faith in Mr. Sarofim allows him to pay only minimal attention to his investments. The artist knows, for example, that he has stock in companies like Merck and Philip Morris, a regular account and a Keogh. And he says he has done well, though he is not certain what his precise returns have been over the years. He looks at his balance every month, he said, ''but just to see if it went up or down.'' **********Nor does he discuss his investments with friends. ''Artists don't compare themselves to each other based on money,'' he said. ''Nobody really knows what money other artists have. They don't care that much. The measure is the work and how you think your work is perceived. How the museums are. How you are doing.'' **********BORN in 1951, Mr. Sultan grew up in Asheville, N.C. His father had wanted to be a painter, but he felt he could not earn a living at it and went into the tire business instead. **********The younger Mr. Sultan at first wanted to be an actor, and as a student at the University of North Carolina gravitated toward filmmaking. But he gave that up when he realized that he would have to spend a lot of time raising money. Painting, he said, gave him ''complete control over my own expression.'' **********He came to New York in 1975, at first supporting himself by helping artists construct lofts during the day and painting at night. Then he got a full-time position as a handyman in the Denise Rene gallery, a job that lasted until the gallery closed in 1978. **********After that, Mr. Sultan won a $2,500 grant from the New York State Council on the Arts. That money enabled him to work full time on his art. ''By then I had started to show at a couple of places and to sell enough work to keep going,'' he said. **********His paintings initially sold for $1,800, but by 1988 some of them were selling for more than $100,000 each. After his art took off, Mr. Sultan bought a house in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and rented an apartment in Paris on the fashionable Rue Marbeuf, just off the Champs Elysees. **********In the early 1990's, though, art prices slumped. ''All hell broke loose,'' Ms. Freedman recalled. ''There was a certain nervousness in the marketplace. You don't have to be a genius to know that people get used to a certain life style.'' **********Mr. Sultan said he just kept working, but linking up with Mr. Sarofim clearly gave him some comfort that he would not fritter away the money he had already earned. **********Many people advise investors to work with several different managers, so they don't make all their bets with a single strategy. But Mr. Sultan is comfortable putting himself in Mr. Sarofim's hands. **********''I am happy because I love him,'' Mr. Sultan said, ''and I don't know anything else about it.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/world/talks-on-kosovo-near-breakdown-deadline-is-today.html,Jane Perlez,1999-02-23,"Kosovo peace talks near collapse as ethnic Albanian delegates refuse to sign proposed agreement despite exhortations of Sec of State Madeleine K Albright and last-minute visit from NATO Commander, Gen Wesley K Clark; Americans seem flabbergasted b...",1358,,The New York Times,World,News,article,DEADLINE IS TODAY,TALKS ON KOSOVO NEAR BREAKDOWN; DEADLINE IS TODAY," **********The Kosovo peace talks were on the verge of breakdown tonight, as five delegates from the ethnic Albanian guerrillas refused the exhortations of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to sign an agreement and were not persuaded by a last-ditch visit from the NATO Commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark. **********Ms. Albright spent much of today huddled in a small conference room of the 14th-century chateau here where the talks are taking place trying to sell the peace agreement to the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who until the talks began two weeks ago had a hit-and-run insurgency operation in an obscure part of southern Europe. **********The Americans seemed flabbergasted by the spectacle of the little-known insurgents holding the United States at bay and undermining the  Clinton Administration's strategy for a peace agreement that had been seen as disproportionately benefiting the ethnic Albanians. **********By refusing to agree to sign a peace settlement, the guerrillas were preventing the United States and its allies from putting pressure on the guerrillas' enemy, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, to agree to allow NATO-led peacekeeping troops in Kosovo. **********The guerrillas also appeared likely to be responsible for putting on hold the movement of thousands of NATO troops, including more than 2,000 United States marines. The NATO forces are in advanced stages of preparing to enter Kosovo, where conflict between ethnic Albanians and Serbs has been roiling for a year. **********In Kosovo today, attacks on villages and fighting between Government troops and rebels increased, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is providing monitors for a fading cease-fire, accused Serbian troops of attacking and harassing monitors. **********The guerrillas' main objection appeared to be the absence of the word ''referendum'' in the political document of the peace proposal, even though the draft calls for an international conference to assess the ''will of the people'' at the end of a three-year interim period. A referendum on independence has been a rallying cry of the guerrilla group. **********Mr. Milosevic has adamantly opposed having NATO-led troops in Kosovo, and NATO has threatened air strikes if he does not agree to accept them. **********But by tonight the threat of air strikes appeared virtually meaningless, and Administration officials seemed almost resigned to folding the talks at the already extended deadline of 3 P.M. Tuesday (9 A.M. Eastern time). The European group has not said how collapse of the talks would affect its commitment to keep the cease-fire monitors in Kosovo. **********Ms. Albright left the talks tonight just before midnight without an answer from the guerrillas. A senior Western diplomat said they did not expect a positive one. **********Several Western diplomats said they were mortified by the pleasure that Mr. Milosevic -- who had been postulated as the certain adversary of any agreement -- must be reaping from the unexpected turnaround. **********A senior Western diplomat said,  ''We can't go to Milosevic without a yes'' from the rebels, adding:  ''We've applied all the diplomatic tricks in the bag. If we're not there, we try to freeze it and see where we go.'' **********After Ms. Albright failed to make headway in three days of meetings with the ethnic Albanians here, the United States decided to call in General Clark, whose military stature and explanation of what his NATO ground troops would do in Kosovo were intended to impress the guerrillas. **********The American general flew from NATO headquarters in Mons, Belgium, to a military airfield near the chateau and spent about half an hour with the five guerrillas late this afternoon, Western diplomats said. **********The meeting did not go well, the diplomats said. The guerrillas returned to the chateau to caucus with the rest of the ethnic Albanian delegation and to give Ms. Albright, who had been left cooling her heels, a final word during the night. **********Administration officials said they were far from confident that the guerrillas would agree to the terms of the settlement even though the ethnic Albanians have been calling unequivocally for a NATO deployment as a way to stop the conflict and to protect their interests. **********The issue of a referendum is important to the rebels, though, because it is seen as a guarantee of separation from Serbia, one of two republics in Yugoslavia. (The other is Montenegro.) Ethnic Albanians make up more than 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a province of Serbia. **********But making a referendum part of the agreement would insure rejection of the deal by Mr. Milosevic. And a referendum is not entirely supported by the West, which backs autonomy for Kosovo but not independence. **********The guerrillas have also been unhappy about the demands in the proposed peace agreement that they disarm over six months or so. They cannot be sure that this is in their interests, they argue, when the Serbian police force would be allowed to keep 2,500 members in Kosovo and the Yugoslav Army would keep 1,500 soldiers on the borders. **********The main opponent to signing the agreement among the ethnic Albanians was Hashim Thaci, a 29-year-old political science graduate of a Swiss university who is leader of the political directorate of the Kosovo Liberation Army. **********Mr. Thaci was described today by a diplomat who knows him as being particularly anti-Serb and the only member of the ethnic Albanian delegation who does not speak Serbian. **********The strength of his opposition to a peace agreement was apparently heightened after he left the peace talks on Friday and flew to Slovenia to meet Adem Demaci, the spokesman for the political wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army and a hard-liner on the question of independence. **********Mr. Demaci refused to attend the peace talks, and diplomats speculated today that he had told Mr. Thaci to remember that independence of Kosovo was the immediate goal. **********What Administration officials perhaps found most frustrating was their lack of understanding of the guerrillas, a relatively new group that sprang on the scene last year. Mr. Thaci was variously described today as ''Hamlet-like'' and ''not understanding the interests of his people.'' **********As the hours trickled away today, the American negotiators desperately tried to come up with a way to get the ethnic Albanians to sign on. **********While the guerrillas constituted only 5 of the 16 members in the delegation, their opinions carried far greater weight than those of the others, diplomats said. One member, Ibrahim Rugova, has twice been elected president in Kosovo in elections that are not recognized by Serbia. But he has had minimal influence at the talks. **********At one point, the Americans thought they had Mr. Thaci isolated and that they would be able to persuade the rest of the ethnic Albanian delegation to sign on without him. But then Jakup Krasniqi, another powerful member of the insurgents -- whom the Americans thought they had successfully wooed -- wavered. **********The atmosphere inside the castle today was described as both chaotic and gloomy, with the chief American negotiator, Ambassador Christopher R. Hill, and Assistant Secretary of State Marc Grossman approaching members from the Kosovo Liberation Army to present them to Ms. Albright in the conference room. **********At the same time, diplomats from the four Western European countries and Russia that make up the rest of the contact group on the Balkans, which sponsored the talks, waited around for what one called ''Madeleine's magic'' to work. But for Ms. Albright, who has invested large amounts of political capital in the success of the talks, the day was particularly frustrating. **********In what appeared to be a move of final desperation, the American negotiators appealed to the new Prime Minister of Albania, Pandeli Majko, to try to persuade the Kosovo Liberation Army to endorse an agreement.  Mr. Majko made a public statement urging the guerrillas to sign and said he would send his Foreign Minister, Paskal Milo, to the talks. **********On the Serbian side of the peace conference, little evolved, diplomats said. The French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, visited the castle and talked with the Serbian President, Milan Milutinovic, who has been designated by Mr. Milosevic as his man at the negotiations. **********It had been planned that once the ethnic Albanians agreed to the agreement that attention would turn to Mr. Milosevic in Belgrade. But tonight any plans to visit him with a final demand appeared to be on hold."

Once limited to dedicated music fans who were also technology buffs, it is expected to increase significantly as the faster Internet connections that enhance audio quality become more widely available over the next few years. **********Spinner says its Internet radio site, Spinner.com, attracts 1.5 million listeners a month and broadcasts more than two million songs a day from a library of 175,000 selections. Nullsoft makes Winamp, the dominant software used to listen to music in MP3 format over the Internet, and Shoutcast, which allows users to broadcast MP3-encoded audio over the Web. About five million people have downloaded Winamp, which is free, and Shoutcast serves as the underpinning for several thousand homemade Internet radio stations. **********Robert W. Pittman, president of America Online, said the company would make both products easier to use. ''Today, if you want to use Spinner or Winamp or Shoutcast, you have to do work,'' he said. ''For them to get this much traction gives us great confidence that we can take the underlying products and give them a mass-market reach.'' **********Mr. Pittman said the new services would generate revenue through advertising and through deals with vendors that sell goods and services on America Online and will now be able to incorporate music and audio into their electronic business more easily. He added that the new audio capacities would be promoted with AOL Plus, the broadband service that it is scheduled to begin selling to some customers this summer. **********The company has said that it plans to create custom audio services for its different on-line holdings, which include the Web sites AOL.com and Netcenter, the on-line service Compuserve and the on-line chat software ICQ. Plans for programming, which would also be available on a new generation of consumer devices that America Online plans to make, include sports events, Internet radio and recorded music. **********The purchase of Spinner is something of a departure for America Online, which has recently steered away from creating its own on-line programming. But analysts say the deals represent an important recognition by the company, which has been criticized as slow to address the anticipated demand for higher-speed access and the services like audio and video that come with it. **********''Making inroads into audio programming mind share right now is of particular importance,'' said Mark Mooradian, an analyst at Jupiter Communications. ''The technology is there. The trick is tapping into the existing audience and building as quickly as possible.'' **********America Online is far from alone in the effort to profit from on-line audio. Competitors include Broadcast.com, an aggregator of Internet audio, which the Internet portal Yahoo has announced plans to buy, and the audio streaming software maker Realnetworks. In addition, Microsoft and AT&T each distribute software that plays MP3 music. **********But a recent survey of America Online subscribers -- the service says it now has 17 million -- found that although a majority engaged in no other activity while they were on line, about 15 percent said they had the stereo turned on. ''If they're doing something else, they're listening to music,'' Mr. Pittman said. ''We figured we'd let them push a button and pick what they want to listen to.''"

It will serve as a distribution point for aid to the more than 200,000 refugees who have entered Albania so far. **********United States officials have described the effort as a humanitarian mission, and repeatedly denied that any ground offensive is planned. **********But local radio stations today buzzed with the news of the American arrival, which  many people took as a signal that NATO ground operations would soon begin in Kosovo. **********There has been much criticism among foreign officials here of the many days it has taken relief organizations, including those of the United Nations, to get large-scale assistance to the refugees. **********But the American relief missions today, in addition to others from Italy and Turkey, turned Tirana's tiny airport into a bustling center from which helicopters were already ferrying food, shelter and medical supplies to the refugees.Cargo trucks also  filed out onto the main highway late into the night. American officials said that up to 500 men would be required to build the base camp before the thousands of U.S. soldiers necessary arrived to handle the airbridge. **********Six more American C-130 cargo planes were to arrive in Albania on Tuesday, and the pace was to accelerate to 10 supply flights a day by Wednesday. **********Airport officials said that six helicopters were already ferrying supplies between the airport and the northern Albanian city of Kukes, near the Kosovo border, where many of the refugees are living on the street and in open fields."

China said two of its citizens were killed and two more were missing. **********China quickly denounced the attack and tonight called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which convened just before midnight. ''We are greatly shocked by the reports of NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy,'' the Chinese representative at the United Nations, Qin Huasun, said. ''NATO's barbarian act is a violation of the U.N. Charter.'' **********In a statement released late tonight, NATO said it had conducted its ''most concentrated attack to date'' against Yugoslavia's capital since the air war began on March 24. It also acknowledged mistakenly bombing a hospital complex and marketplace in Nis, an attack which the Yugoslav Government said had killed 15 people. **********Among the targets in Belgrade was another of Mr. Milosevic's residences, beneath which was a major bunker complex that NATO described as the wartime political and military headquarters for the Yugoslav Government. **********''NATO has information that suggests this is now the center of Mr. Milosevic's high command, following the destruction and damage done to other command facilities,'' NATO's statement said. **********NATO said it did not mean to hit the Chinese Embassy. ''NATO regrets any damage to the embassy or injuries to Chinese diplomatic personnel,'' the statement said. **********Although NATO and American officials offered no explanation for how NATO could have hit the embassy, NATO did target the Hotel Yugoslavia, which is close by. The officials said that this hotel has been taken over as a headquarters and barracks for the special paramilitary police, headed by Zeljko Raznjatovic, who is known as Arkan. **********A senior Pentagon official declined to say whether NATO's barrage was intended to kill him or any other Yugoslav leaders, including Mr. Milosevic, but NATO's statement could be read as implying as much. ''These strikes were planned to disrupt the national leadership of military and special police operations,'' the statement said. **********The barrage tonight came after a day in which NATO faced new questions about the consequences of its air war. Moments before reports of the midnight strike against the embassy, NATO officials acknowledged that cluster bombs dropped from an  F-16 fighter jet had extensively damaged a hospital complex and marketplace in Nis, the third largest city in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Government said 15 people died. **********Yugoslav officials, who escorted journalists to the scene in Nis, reported that an additional 60 to 70 people had been wounded. Dismembered bodies lay on a nearby street around yellow casings from the cluster bombs. The bombs, after detonating, cover a target with smaller bomblets that float to the ground with small parachutes. **********The damage to the embassy, which is in the new section of Belgrade, west of the Sava River, is certain to add tumult to the strained relations between the United States and China, which has been sharply critical of the NATO air campaign. **********As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China has veto power over any settlement that would have the international body's imprimatur. **********On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry of China called on NATO to halt the bombing, saying that it had caused ''great civilian casualties.'' Tonight, Mr. Qin, the representative to the United Nations, said, ''We call on NATO to stop immediately its military actions, so as to avoid further humanitarian disasters.'' **********The White House immediately reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington to inform it about the strike, an Administration official said. Later, the American Ambassador to China, James Sasser, spoke with officials in Beijing, the Washington official said. **********The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, was ''shocked and distressed'' at the report of the strike, his spokesman said. **********Despite the questions about casualties, officials vowed to press ahead with the air war and predicted a heavy night of bombardment was expected across the country. **********The strikes began as evening fell in Yugoslavia and allied planes attacked four electrical transformers in and around Belgrade, once again darkening the capital and much of the rest of the country, officials said. **********In its statement, NATO also reported striking numerous Government and military buildings in the center of the city, including the Army's General Staff building, two Ministry of Defense buildings, the Federal paramilitary police headquarters and two other buildings linked to Yugoslavia's weapons procurement. **********The barrage followed a three-day lull in strikes against the capital that coincided with diplomatic efforts to end the air campaign, even though NATO officials insisted that there was no correlation. The strike at the embassy occurred after a second powerful series of explosions rocked the capital. A Yugoslav official reported that the building was evacuated and that some people had been taken to hospitals. **********''Now I would like to see how NATO will justify this,'' a Yugoslav Cabinet Minister, Goran Matic, said, according to The Associated Press.  ''It was a deliberate targeting of the Chinese Embassy. It's high time to end this madness.'' **********Even as diplomats from Washington to Moscow shuttled from capital to capital, carrying the outlines of a possible peace settlement, the United States and NATO pledged to intensify the attacks, which continued for the 45th day today. **********A consequence of the intensified assault has been growing numbers of misfires and civilian deaths, which the alliance has repeatedly said it hoped to avoid. For the fifth time, a stray missile landed in Bulgaria. No one was hurt. **********NATO's errant bombing in Nis was far graver. NATO and Pentagon officials reported a major attack by allied planes against the airfield in Nis, as well as a radio tower, but at least one bomb fell short of its target, for reasons that remained unclear. **********''Unfortunately, it is highly probable that a weapon went astray and hit civilian buildings,'' a statement released tonight at NATO headquarters in Brussels said. ''There was no intent to harm civilians during this strike.'' **********From the start, NATO has emphasized that civilian deaths were always a possibility in warfare. The Yugoslav Government has used the deaths to portray the attacks as indiscriminate acts of barbarity. **********To counter what many officials here consider disproportionate attention to NATO's mistakes, the Pentagon today provided a compilation of reports of atrocities attributed to Mr. Milosevic's campaign of ''ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo. **********The Pentagon's compilation detailed more than 20 towns or cities in Kosovo where more than 100 people have been reported killed or more than 1,000 people have been displaced. **********In Washington today, the Army commander of the three American soldiers captured along the Macedonian border six weeks ago said that NATO had closed its posts there.  Maj. Gen. David Grange said NATO had kept the observation posts open throughout March despite the attacks on the United States Embassy in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, and the rising tensions along the border. It only decided to close the posts after the three soldiers were held. **********During a briefing on the nearly completed military investigation of the soldiers' monthlong captivity, General Grange insisted that the three soldiers were more than one mile inside Macedonia when they were captured on March 31."

Each with his own scars, his own past and his own vision of vengeance. They came from half a dozen different countries, in a dozen different ways, but they all ended up on the same high-speed ferry crossing the Adriatic Sea and they all planned to fight for Kosovo, the place where they all were born. **********They were not the first Kosovo Albanians to gather informally at the wharf in the Italian port city of Bari and then, realizing their common resentment of Serbian military action, to travel together on the uncertain trip home. **********Nor does anyone expect them to be the last. The arrival of groups like this over the weekend seems to confirm the reports that Kosovo expatriates are returning in strong numbers to join the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, whose battles against the Yugoslav Government brought the crackdown a year ago that has led to the current crisis. **********None of the 50 men in this group say they have ever fought with the rebels. Some served in the Yugoslav Army, which they have come back to fight against. A few fled their beloved homeland to avoid the mandatory service that might have forced them to take up arms against Bosnians or Croats in past wars. **********They have no training, no uniforms, no weapons. They say they do not know whom to contact in Albania to take them to the front. But they are sure the rebels will find them. **********''We have the heart for Kosovo,'' said Ylber Tafili, 31, who has lived in New York and Toronto since leaving Kosovo 13 years ago. ''Even if we are going back with nothing.'' **********Nor can they expect much. The rebels have been described as a rough and disorganized bunch, not terribly well armed and with weak leadership. The NATO alliance has not budged from its position of refusing any direct aid to the rebels. Alabanian officials say they support the rebels politically and morally, but not militarily. **********None of that mattered to Mr. Tafili and a friend, Afrim Gashi, 35, who also came from Kosovo and now lives in Toronto. They traveled together on a journey that took them six days. They flew from Toronto to Hamburg, Germany, where they visited relatives and spoke openly about their plans to return to Kosovo. **********Then they boarded a train for the long journey from Hamburg, south across the Alps into Italy and down the Italian peninsula to the port at Bari. **********On they way they watched as other Kosovo Albanians boarded the train in small groups or alone. Some had been living in Germany, others in Norway, Sweden, Italy and other countries. **********By the time they arrived at the terminal for the high-speed ferry in Bari, their common language and shared goals had united them. There they met others who had come from different directions, but with similar intentions. They almost showed some military bearing as they marched aboard the ferry, not so much as a trained regiment, but as people united in a cause. **********But they still were strangers, and on board the ferry for the four-hour trip, they settled into their second-class seats in different groups, those from Germany by and large together, and some of the younger men apart from the older ones. **********Little by little the rocking of the ferry lulled them to sleep and they disappeared from view, stretched out on the floor between seats. Most were sound asleep when the ferry passed several NATO vessels stationed in the Adriatic. **********But about an hour from the Albanian port of Durres they started to stir and were willing to share their personal stories with a visitor. Their tales revealed as clearly as any dissertation the simmering resentment and wounded lives that have fertilized the hatred and fed the anger in the Balkans for so long. **********For Mr. Tafili, it began with his father, who had dared raise a voice for democracy in the dark days of Communist dictatorship in Yugoslavia. For that he spent seven years in jail. **********Mr. Tafili was born in the city of Pec, in western Kosovo, and was repeatedly reminded of his father's supposed transgressions. When he turned 18, Mr. Tafili was forced into the Yugoslav Army, and he was repeatedly challenged there, too, to defend his father's history. **********''I knew I would either end up dead or in jail,'' he said. **********When he completed the year's service, he returned to school. With two friends he organized a protest against the Government. His friends were arrested, but he escaped and kept on running, first into Austria, then to Canada. **********He lived in New York from 1993 to 1995, working as a taxi dispatcher in Queens. He has since returned to Toronto, where he works for a catering company at Pearson International Airport. **********His mother left Kosovo six years ago to join him, but a sister and her two children remain. He does not know where they are or what happened to them since the bombing began, because when he calls, the phone rings but no one answers. **********''My heart beats for my sister and her family, of course, but there is more involved,'' he said. ''If coming to Kosovo means fighting, then, yes, I will die for my land, for my father's beliefs and for mine.'' **********Some of the men were less willing to share the details of their lives. They declined to be photographed, and some were afraid to identify themselves fully. **********''I am sorry,'' said Cani, 27, who fled a small village in western Kosovo that Albanians call Gelance eight years ago to avoid military service, ''but the point is that if I give my full name they will harass my family.'' **********Cani lives in Hanover, Germany, he said, where he works as a journalist for a radio station that broadcasts to the Albanian community there. When he fled Kosovo, he left behind a brother, a sister, his parents and a grandmother, and he is worried about them. **********''I believe they have gone to the mountains, about eight miles from the city,'' he said. Of all the men, he alone wore a military camouflage hat, something he had bought. ''I heard from somebody in Albania that the Serb artillery is bombimg the camp. The village itself is destroyed.'' **********By Balkan standards of income and wealth, these men had all done well. Most wore new boots or shoes they had bought for the trip. Arben, 27, from Hoxter, Germany, left the town in Kosovo whose Albanian name is Vitia nine years ago. Now he traveled in an imitation leather jacket and pants, with an Adidas cap and a heavy gold chain around his neck. **********The second Canadian volunteer, Afrim Gashi, owns a coffee shop in Toronto and has justed started his own construction company. He and his wife have a nine-month-old son, named Agim after Mr. Gashi's brother, who he said was killed in Chicago in 1992. Although he has no proof, he is certain that Serbs did it. **********''I am going back to Kosovo first of all for my family and for the others who need help,'' Mr. Gashi said. ''I watched TV and I saw the kids who went to Macedonia and then were sent out and thought, 'If nothing else, at least I can go and help them.' '' **********He spent a year with the Yugoslav Army, in a tank division, and has heard that in the neighborhood where he grew up in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, 50 Albanians have been killed. If the need arises, he said, he is ready to fight. **********''If there's a chance to go inside Kosovo,'' he said, ''I will go.'' **********As the younger men made boasts about fighting, and dying, for their homeland, Ismet Krasniqi sat quietly listening, daring to disagree only with his eyes. It was when the men were asked about the rebel group's reputation of raising money through illegal drug deals that he spoke up. **********''It is Albanian people who live outside Kosovo and the Albanian people who live inside Kosovo'' who finance the rebels, Mr. Krasniqi said. ''It's not from drugs. It's people like me.'' **********In Kosovo he was trained as an engineer, but he said that in Pec he was beaten up by Serbs five times and pulled in for questioning more than 25 times. He finally left five years ago to start his life over in Buchholz in a town in Germany, where he has become an archeologist for the local government. **********''We are going there to fight because in this century we cannot allow families to be deported like animals,'' he said. He said he had spoken by telephone to people in Albania who were in touch with Pec. **********''The neighborhood I lived in does not exist any more,'' he said. **********Finally, after 9 P.M., the ferry docked at Durres. The 50 dutifully gathered their belongings and submitted to cursory immigration checks aboard ship. **********Then, silently this time, they filed out onto the dock. The air was cool and smelled of sea water. It had rained earlier, but now the sky was clear and dark. **********They found nobody waiting for them at the dock. **********They made their own way to Tirana and disappeared into the city."

''When it's cold out, customers shop more quickly,'' said Ray Venezia, meat manager for the Fairway Operating Corporation's two stores. ''Now, they have a more leisurely attitude toward shopping.'' **********Visitors were also dawdling last week around the penguin exhibit at the Central Park Zoo, where the birds enjoy a constant 34 degrees. Though workers who maintain the exhibit might have been tempted to dawdle, too, they were fully employed. **********''Summer is the busiest time of the year with the penguin chicks,'' said Rob Gramzay, a senior wild-animal keeper who works in the polar bird building with the penguins and puffins. ''In the winter the exhibit is still 34 degrees, and we don't get to warm up like in the summer.'' **********Workers at New England Ice Cream in Brockton, Mass., face truly Arctic conditions: It's 20 below in the warehouse. George Kapotas, the distribution manager, said that even though ''this time of year it's the perfect place to be,'' he limits workers to 20 minutes inside at a time, because of the danger of frostbite and hypothermia, even when using protective gear. **********Fans of ''Late Show with David Letterman,'' many of whom wear shorts to survive the blazing heat as they stand in line for tickets, complain about the low-60's cold  inside the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan, where the show is taped. **********Tony Mendez, the ''Late Night'' cue card guy, said the chilly air keeps the crowd peppy. ''If it's warmer, the audience gets sleepy,'' he said. '' 'It keeps the jokes fresh' is what Dave says.'' **********Is there a down side to a frigid workplace in a heat wave?

The caller promised to increase by perhaps 5 percent the $1.6 million annual revenue of the computer sales and service company that Gary C. McLendon founded in Fayetteville, Ark., 16 years ago. **********Scarcely 10 weeks later, however, Mr. McLendon is struggling to absorb hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses to an overseas credit card scam that has consumed the company's cash reserves and devoured his equity in its building. ''Here I am -- 54 years old and starting over again,'' Mr. McLendon said. **********There were several calls, actually, the first crossing the Atlantic in May. A man who identified himself as ''John Monga'' of London inquired after computer chips retailed by Mr. McLendon's company, GCM Computers. Not one or two or a half-dozen of the chips -- Intel Pentium III-450's and Pentium III-500's, then priced as high as $700 apiece -- but 20. The caller said that Whitehall had commissioned him to upgrade a large number of British Government computers. **********''I said to myself, 'Oh, boy,' '' Mr. McLendon recalled. **********Mr. Monga's enterprise, which he identified as Maple Solutions Ltd., needed overnight delivery; would Mr. McLendon mind accepting a Visa payment? **********Not at all, especially after the credit card company authorized the transaction. Mr. McLendon shipped the chips. His eyes were not wide shut, not completely; two days later he checked his account and found that, indeed, the $20,000 payment was there. **********Within 72 hours, GCM Computers, which can be found on the Internet among the thousands of computer companies, was receiving calls from people who identified themselves as London associates of Mr. Monga who had learned from him of Mr. McLendon's ability to provide Pentium chips quickly. A man who called himself Calvin Anderson called. An ''Edwin Reynolds'' called. ''So did some guy with an eastern name, but even he had a very British accent,'' Mr. McLendon said. All wanted chips. All wanted immediate delivery. All wanted to pay with a Visa or Mastercard. **********Mr. McLendon obtained electronic authorizations for all of them. But nine days after his first shipment to his new British customers, Mr. McLendon received a different sort of telephone call, from Simmons First National Bank of Pine Bluff, Ark., which processed GCM's bank card transactions. A Visa authorization had been canceled, and as part of its legal contract with the bank, GCM was now responsible for covering the amount. The bank was debiting GCM's account. **********''I could cover it, so it wasn't that big a deal,'' Mr. McLendon said, especially since within minutes Mr. Reynolds was on the other line, ''buying time,'' apologizing for a bookkeeping error that had prompted the charge back to GCM's account and promising to set things right at once. **********''I didn't even know what a chargeback was,'' said Mr. McLendon, who was nonetheless reassured. ''I thought, whew, this isn't as bad as I thought it was.'' It was worse. The personal Visa account number that Mr. Reynolds provided to make good the debt was denied authorization. And the wire transfer Mr. Reynolds promised in a subsequent telephone call never materialized. **********The next day it was Simmons Bank calling again, advising Mr. McLendon that it had been in contact with Scotland Yard and, regrettably, GCM Computers' British business had crashed. ''All the charges were coming back,'' Mr. McLendon said. In the 10 days since its first London order, GMC had dispatched some $1 million in computer parts to Mr. Monga and his associates. After some shipments that Mr. McLendon was able to recall, his outstanding balance with Simmons Bank was about $800,000. **********NEITHER the sum nor the episode was unusual. Law enforcement officials say the fraud ring that hit Mr. McLendon and several other United States computer companies (including two others in Arkansas) consisted primarily of Nigerian nationals operating from Britain and the United States. A joint investigation by Scotland Yard and American authorities has produced several arrests with more expected, according to James E. Mackin, a spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington, which investigates credit card fraud. **********David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a credit card industry newsletter published in Oxnard, Calif., said: ''These people aren't bumbling thieves. They're pros, and they're highly intelligent and highly organized.'' **********''Some get arrested, sure,'' Mr. Robertson added, ''but others come along right after them, like a stream of ants.'' Most credit card organizations do not break down, or disclose, fraud losses incurred by merchants independent of those borne by banks, but a spokesman for Visa U.S.A. said they account for about 10 percent of total fraud losses, which would put the merchants' share well into the tens of millions of dollars. Mastercard International alone experienced $526 million in fraudulent transactions last year -- eight cents of every $100 in transactions, an increase of almost 14 percent from 1997. **********Much of the losses, experts say, are driven by the Internet, and with electronic commerce growing, merchants will have to be vigilant about protecting themselves. **********Mr. McLendon, who had assumed that his liability was virtually nil, was caught in a little-noticed clause of bank credit card agreements that puts merchants at risk for charges not recorded on the premises. Had Mr. Monga and his associates flown to Fayetteville and signed for the computer chips rather than using fax, telephone and E-mail, Mr. McLendon would be home free. **********Mr. McLendon's lawyers concluded that his best option was a settlement with Simmons Bank. That agreement was signed in late July, and while it prohibits either party from discussing its terms, Mr. McLendon says he bears the brunt of the losses. **********''The credit card system is badly broken, and it badly needs repair,'' Mr. McLendon said. Should a stolen card be used in a sale, he insists, ''There's nothing to alert the merchant that anything's wrong'' until the card's rightful owner sounds the alarm. **********Tommy May, the chairman of Simmons, a $1.7 billion bank holding company and processor of credit card transactions, said, ''The industry believes there are adequate safeguards'' for merchants. At the same time, Mr. May acknowledged, it would be naive to consider any security system in the Internet age foolproof. **********Mr. Robertson agrees. Even as the industry deploys ever more advanced technology to thwart thieves, he said, ''These are very sophisticated criminals, and they've defeated every known security system.'' **********Reflecting on 10 days that shook his world, Mr. McLendon concluded, ''It was a hell of an education.''"

At the last minute, all other candidates withdrew from the ballot in protest. **********Mr. Bouteflika, 62, a veteran of Governments that the military led in the 1960's and 70's, was credited in official tabulations with having won nearly 74 percent of the vote in the election on Thursday. **********At a news conference, he dismissed opponents' claims that he had been imposed by the generals, who have held real power here for decades, and said that he was ready to be sworn in as soon as the formalities had been completed, probably by the end of the month. **********''Absolutely, absolutely,'' Mr. Bouteflika told reporters who asked whether he considered his election legitimate. ''Whether it is in Algeria, or France or Sweden, 74 percent of the votes is a very decent score.'' **********The fraud allegations centered on reports that his tally had been inflated by millions of phantom ballots prepared in advance by the Government of President Liamine Zeroual. **********The outcome was a sharp disappointment for Algerians, who had hoped that the vote would usher in an era of civilian rule free from any taint of army control. Their hopes were encouraged when Mr. Zeroual, a retired general, and the army commander, Gen. Mohammed Lamari, pledged at the outset of the campaign that the army would be neutral and suggested that it was time for the army to leave politics altogether. **********If Algerians conclude that Mr. Bouteflika's election was rigged, it could raise new doubts about the country's ability to emerge from the trauma of recent years, when armed Islamist groups have waged a brutal struggle for power. The conflict began after the army canceled elections in 1992 because victory seemed to be going to the Islamic Salvation Front, which had pledged to impose strict Islamic rule. **********In the last year, with popular sentiment shifting sharply against the Islamic guerrillas and with the army gaining the upper hand in the fighting, Algerians had begun to talk of moving to a new era of moderation, with the radicals and the generals sidelined in favor of a civilian government. **********But if Mr. Bouteflika is seen as a front man for the generals, many people in this nation of 30 million fear that opinion could begin to shift back to the Islamic militants. **********Even as Mr. Bouteflika celebrated, hundreds of protesters who were gathering in a square in central Algiers, mostly young men, were charged by the police. Several people were wounded by the charges, and at least 20 arrested. One elderly man appeared to have been seriously hurt, and lay face down on the road for at least 20 minutes before an ambulance took him away. **********The police suppressed similar protests in Tizi-Ouzou and Bajaia, two cities east of Algiers that have been strongholds of opposition to Mr. Bouteflika, Reuters reported. **********In Algiers, Mr. Bouteflika's supporters responded to the protests by organizing lengthy motorcades that wound through the streets to the accompaniment of honking horns and waving Algerian flags. **********Interior Minister Abdelmalik Sellal said 10.5 million of the 17.5 million eligible voters had cast ballots, a turnout of slightly more than 60 percent. He angrily rejected the allegations of vote rigging, saying everything possible had been done to eliminate fraud. ''Ever since 1992, whatever the Government did, all we ever heard was, 'Fraud, fraud, fraud!' '' Mr. Sellal said. ''We were so fed up with it that we were determined to have an election that was free of any suggestion of taint''. **********The allegations seem highly likely to be a major handicap for Mr. Bouteflika, not least because there is no way to test them. At the outset of the campaign, the Government rejected demands by opposition candidates and Western Governments, including the United States, for international monitors, saying observers would constitute interference in internal affairs. **********The high turnout reported by the Government surprised many, contrasting as it did with what was visible on Thursday, when polling stations here appeared to be largely deserted. Western news agencies reported that similar quiet was evident at stations in other major centers. **********But final Government figures showed turnouts in some towns and cities of more than 70 percent, offsetting single-figure turnouts in areas of eastern Algeria, where Mr. Bouteflika's support is low. **********Although all the candidates except Mr. Bouteflika withdrew from the contest 24 hours before the election, the names of all seven remained on the ballot. Opinion polls published by independent newspapers in the monthlong campaign had pointed to a victory by Mr. Bouteflika, but not by anywhere close to such a huge margin. **********The Interior Ministry said a moderate Islamic candidate, Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, was the runner-up to Mr. Bouteflika, with nearly 13 per cent of the votes. Another moderate Islamic candidate, Abdellah Djaballah, was third, with nearly 4 percent, and Hocine Ait Ahmed, a Socialist who was a leader of the struggle for independence from France, received 3 percent. Mr. Ait Ahmed, 73, was favored to run strongly but suffered a heart attack and spent the last two weeks of the campaign in a Swiss hospital. **********At a news conference, Mr. Ibrahimi, who is 67 and spent 23 years as a minister in military-led governments, said the Government had printed millions of extra ballots that had been added to Mr. Bouteflika's total. Nonetheless, he said, the election had moved Algeria closer to democracy by exposing the generals. **********''We have smashed their democratic facade,'' he said. ''Instead of responding to the Algerian people's yearning for change, they have chosen repression, and they will have to answer for the consequences.''"

''We hope that they will reconsider their decision.'' **********American, which is the country's second largest airline after UAL Corporation's United Airlines, said that it was disappointed in the union's decision to reject the mediator's proposal. The airline repeated its pledge to move forward with its plans to integrate Reno, a small Western line that it acquired, into its larger network on Aug. 31. **********The union's board met yesterday to consider how it would respond to any unilateral move by the airline, but its options are limited. **********Thousands of pilots called in sick in February to protest the Reno acquisition, forcing American to cancel nearly 6,700 flights and inconveniencing hundreds of thousands of passengers. The pilots returned to work only after a Federal judge found them in contempt. He subsequently fined the union and its two top officers $45.5 million, and the union pledged in court not to disrupt American's operations further. **********Individual pilots could refuse to fly overtime or work to rule to show their displeasure with the company, but any concerted action is likely to get the union into more trouble with the court. **********Another option that the union is contemplating would be to file a lawsuit to block the Reno integration.  Finally, the union could file formal grievances against the company, according to its contract, although such cases can take years to arbitrate. **********''It's going to be ugly,'' one pilot said. ''There is no doubt about that. We've come to the conclusion that pilots' views and concerns and career expectations and the contract itself do not have any significance to this management team.'' **********The union made its announcement after the stock market closed yesterday. But AMR shares fell $1.75 to close at $61.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********American bought Reno in December for $124 million, setting off the conflict with the pilots. The union demanded that American give immediate pay raises to Reno's 300 pilots and to 1,900 American pilots who will be promoted as a result of the addition of Reno's 25 jets. **********After months of negotiations beginning in March, American and the union agreed to a series of retroactive pay raises for the Reno pilots and also drafted a memorandum of understanding over how future mergers would be handled. **********But the two sides split over the union's insistence that American tacitly admit that its purchase of Reno violated the so-called scope clause in the pilot contract, which guarantees that the union contract covers all flying of large jets at the airline and its subsidiaries. **********A second sticking point concerned  472 pilots temporarily laid off between 1993 and 1996. American offered to give them credit for half the vacation time and pension benefits they lost. The union is insisting that American make all the pilots whole for the lost benefits. **********The issue is an emotional one for the union because Reno was founded at the same time American withdrew from certain Western routes and laid off the pilots. Reno quickly struck an alliance with American and that deal was widely seen by the union as an underhanded way for American to divert traffic to a lower-cost alternative. **********Now, unless American agrees to make up the difference, the Reno pilots who will be joining American will have greater benefits than the laid-off pilots whose jobs the union contends they took. American said that giving the furloughed pilots their full benefits would cost $20 million. But the union replied that that was the amount spread over the pilots' entire careers. **********''It's the right thing to do for a group of loyal employees,'' Mr. LaVoy said, ''and it carries a very small price compared to some of the other recent financial decisions management has made.''"

Today he stood dazed as rescue workers searched for his wife, Yaname, who was eight and a half months pregnant when an avalanche of mud and rock engulfed the family's small house on a mountainside here late last week. **********''I've lost everything, even the will to live,'' said Mr. Luque, a 33-year-old electrician. ''But I want them to find her body so that I can say goodbye to her and then leave here and never, never have to see this place again.'' **********As Venezuela struggles to recover from its worst natural disaster of modern times, brought on by three days of torrential rain that set off vast landslides and flooding, the suffering and the death toll continue to mount. **********And here in the capital, no neighborhood has been harder hit than Blandin, a squatter settlement perched precariously on a hillside below a main highway. **********''We probably should never have built houses along this ravine, but when you are poor, you learn to be thankful for whatever you can get,'' said Franklin Figuera, a 57-year-old chauffeur who has lived in the area his whole life and saw both his own house and his elderly mother's destroyed. ''We got away with it for a long time, but now nature has returned to reclaim what is hers.'' **********The devastation along Venezuela's northern Caribbean coast is so widespread that a week after the rains began, authorities are still having difficulty quantifying it. With more than 150,000 people driven from their homes and confusion about the whereabouts of many, estimates of the number of deaths range from 500 to 25,000. **********In Blandin, the task of recovering bodies and determining the death toll has fallen to the same Caracas fire department unit that found the bodies of Mr. Luque's son and a still unidentified adult on Tuesday. **********In carrying out that job, the team is guided as much by the stench of death, so powerful that it penetrates even sanitary masks, as by the urging of residents who want them to excavate the houses of neighbors who are missing. **********''We are recovering hardly any whole corpses,'' said Capt. Vicente Campos Ron, the head of the search squad. ''What we are finding is a head here, an arm or a leg there, which makes it hard to identify the bodies or calculate how many people have actually died in this catastrophe.'' **********Captain Campos said his men have recovered 32 bodies in Blandin so far. But Solaine Diaz, a relief worker from the mayor's office, estimated the death toll in the neighborhood at ''about 140,'' while Marlene Montero, leader of a community association, said she feared 3,000 people have died. **********Relief workers have begun a census, but that process has been slowed by continued bad weather, including a relatively light but steady rain throughout the day today that may have contributed to a helicopter crash that killed eight people. **********''We don't want our people getting caught in one of the little landslides that are still occurring and then have to add them to the casualty list,'' Ms. Diaz said. **********But when one worker called this morning on Wilton Pilligua, a 29-year-old bricklayer, Mr. Pilligua took a break from removing his belongings from the remains of his house. The bodies of two of his nephews, 9-year-old Kelvin and 4-year-old Estefan, have been recovered, but his sister Irma, the boys' mother, is still missing, and Mr. Pilligua handed over a photograph of her in hopes it can be matched with a recovered corpse. **********As Mr. Pilligua looked through the family photo album, a friend rushed in to tell him that someone had just made off with the television set he had left at a nearby street corner. At that news, Mr. Pilligua's wife, Mercedes, whose grandfather and two cousins are missing, burst into tears and went off to try to protect the couple's few remaining possessions. **********Venezuelans have been living with this disaster since Dec. 15, the day they went to the polls and overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that expands the powers of President Hugo Chavez and his military allies. It rained heavily all that day; early the next day, as many of Blandin's residents were asleep, the first avalanche struck. **********''We've had minor flooding before, but this all happened very quickly,'' said Jhonny Villegas, 28, a laborer. ''The mountain began to shake and tremble, there was this terrible noise, and then all of a sudden a gigantic wave of mud and debris was upon us and we could do nothing but scramble up the side of the mountain and pray that we would be spared.'' **********The force of the initial landslide, which survivors describe as being more than 20 feet high, swept away everything as it descended the mountain, picking up speed and mass as it advanced. Today tree trunks, refrigerators, automobiles, even a passenger bus remained half embedded in the fetid mud that has accumulated at the bottom of a ravine. **********''That boulder wasn't there before,'' said Mr. Figuera, pointing to a rock formation the size of a house sitting in the middle of what had been a street but is now a stream littered with clothing, furniture, household appliances and Christmas decorations. ''God only knows where it came from.'' **********Authorities are now demanding that residents leave Blandin, citing the lack of water and electricity and the danger of more landslides and disease. **********Though Fairee Hernandez, the only nurse working in the neighborhood, warns of ''an epidemic of rabies'' and says she has also diagnosed hepatitis and diarrhea, many survivors refuse to go. **********''I have to take care of this house because our family has nothing else left and no other place to go,'' said Francisco Portillo, 69, a mechanic who has taken in all his homeless in-laws and their children. ''We can't leave here because robbers would come and steal what little we have left, as they have already done in the houses that have been abandoned.'' **********This morning a military unit with a loudspeaker came through, warning that anyone refusing to leave would be removed by force. To step up the pressure, residents complain, people who leave Blandin in search of food or water are being prevented from returning at checkpoints the army and National Guard have set up. **********''They want to resettle us way off in the Amazon or the plains because they say there is housing and plenty of land there,'' Wilmer Rodriguez, a 23-year-old student and warehouse employee said dismissively. ''But there aren't any jobs in those places, so why would we want to leave Caracas to go there?'' **********But Carmen del Prado said she wanted to get her family out as soon as she could. She is having trouble sleeping, she said, because every time it begins to rain she fears the mountain will come crashing down on her again. **********''The smell of the dead is so dreadful, and I spend every waking moment in anguish over the destruction of this community,'' she said. ''What has happened can be told, but it cannot be believed. It's all over for us here. There is nothing left, not even memories.''"

But last week, the second page of the proudly gritty newspaper listed restaurants where one could splurge on caviar and an esoteric exhibit of X-rays as art at the Julie Saul Gallery in SoHo.

Serbian forces had accelerated their campaign of ethnic murder and expulsions in Kosovo and an American F-117 stealth fighter had gone down just west of Belgrade. **********NATO war planners decided the day before to expand their list of targets to include Serbian military and police units, who were conducting an offensive against Kosovo civilians that was unexpected in its speed and savagery. **********President Clinton surveyed the dispirited faces of his senior advisers -- including the Secretaries of State and Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of Central Intelligence -- and decided they needed a pep talk, according to an official who attended the meeting. **********''He said, 'Guys, let's not lose sight of why we did this,' '' the official said. '' 'Let's not forget what prompted us to do this and who is responsible.' '' **********It is telling that only four days into a long-planned bombardment of the forces of Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Yugoslavia, Mr. Clinton needed to buck up the senior officials who advised him to pursue the military option. **********And to do so, he had to conceal his own doubts about the course he had chosen, according to advisers. While Mr. Clinton is confident he was justified in ordering the air and missile attacks, one adviser said, the decision has gnawed at him and cost him sleep. **********Administration officials have repeatedly said that no one should be surprised by the campaign of terror visited on Kosovo by Mr. Milosevic's troops in the days following the start of allied bombing a week ago today. **********The President today cast the mission as one that would take some time and that had been hampered by bad weather, and he asked Americans for their patience. **********''It takes a while to get up and going,'' Mr. Clinton said in an interview with Dan Rather on CBS. ''The American people and the people of the NATO nations should not be surprised that what has happened on the ground has happened. It was always obvious it was going to happen, if there was no opposition to Milosevic. And this thing hasn't had enough time to work. So I would ask the American people to be patient, and to be resolved, and to be firm.'' **********Mr. Clinton was warned that Mr. Milosevic was intent on ruthlessly driving ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. But the President and his advisers seem taken aback by the sheer ferocity of Mr. Milosevic's onslaught and the scale of the humanitarian disaster it spawned. **********''It's one thing to say we expected this, but living it is not the same as thinking about it,'' one adviser said. **********As reports of atrocities and heartbreaking pictures of columns of refugees pour in from the Balkans, Mr. Clinton and the White House have endeavored to present a picture of confidence. Directly after the Monday foreign policy meeting, for example, Mr. Clinton drove to suburban Virginia for a round of golf, a display of nonchalance that recalled, at least to some critics, President Bush's golf outings and speedboat rides during the 1990 buildup to the war in the Persian Gulf. **********Mr. Clinton has kept a more-or-less normal schedule this week, handling routine ceremonial duties and keeping an engagement to speak at an electronics industry dinner on Tuesday night. **********In another effort to avoid the appearance of being seized by crisis, officials in Washington, who themselves have dribbled out scraps of information about the war in vague daily briefings, have allowed the briefers at NATO headquarters to be the leading voices on the conflict. This is part of a deliberate strategy to portray Kosovo as chiefly a European, not an American concern, according to Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary. **********''I think we have consciously tried to have the allies be the main spokespeople for this. And this was a decision not just by the United States, but by all 19 members of NATO,'' Mr. Lockhart said. **********By making NATO the voice of the operation, the United States, which is the dominant force in the alliance, may manage to bear less of the blame if it goes sour -- and less of the credit if it succeeds. **********The understated American role also stands in contrast to Mr. Bush's leadership in the gulf war. He organized a coalition under United Nations auspices but never left any doubt that he was commanding it. **********While striving to maintain a businesslike demeanor in public, in private President Clinton is preoccupied with the Balkan crisis, aides said. ''There's a heaviness to this decision that affects him,'' one adviser said. ''No matter how long you've been at this job, you never get used to these tough calls.'' **********Kosovo is the first thing Mr. Clinton deals with in the morning and the last matter on his mind at night, this adviser said. He has also been plagued by a cold and seasonal allergies, lending to his haggard appearance in recent days. **********He admitted in his interview with Mr. Rather today that he had ''pent-up feelings'' about Kosovo, but added: ''I think the President's supposed to keep a lot of those feelings pent up.'' **********The Balkans have troubled him since his first days in office. He was determined not to repeat the hesitation and indecision that marked his and NATO's handling of the Bosnia crisis from 1992 to 1995. And in fact the West acted more quickly when Mr. Milosevic moved on Kosovo than when he undertook his offensive in Bosnia seven years ago. **********Nonetheless, there is evident improvisation in the Administration's and NATO's decision-making on Kosovo. Mr. Milosevic did not capitulate after the first few days of bombing, as the allies had hoped, so NATO decided to raise the stakes last weekend to attack his forces in the field. **********When two days of that effort failed to deter him, the allies quickly moved on to a restricted version of what eventually will be ''Phase 3,'' adding Government ministries in downtown Belgrade and other command-and-control facilities to the target list. **********The cumulative picture is of a war being planned on the fly, with hurried escalation following each new provocation. **********A senior national security official said that in fact the allies were ''learning by doing how you conduct a NATO operation, both at a political and a military level.'' **********How, then, do NATO and the United States plan to pursue the war in Yugoslavia if Phases 1, 2 and 3 fail to persuade Mr. Milosevic to withdraw his forces? **********What is Phase 4? **********Said one exasperated senior official, ''There is no Phase 4.''"

Davis called him King William, and so he was: the heir to leadership of the Ford Motor Company, William C. Ford Jr., took the stage today to run the family-controlled company's annual meeting for the first time. **********Ford is a 96-year-old dynasty of industrial America, but it used information-age technology today to introduce its 42-year-old chairman to shareholders here and even to viewers in Times Square in New York City, where the first 30 minutes of the annual meeting were broadcast live on a giant TV screen this morning. **********Mr. Ford, a great-grandson of Henry Ford and the first Ford family member to lead the company since his uncle Henry Ford 2d presided over an annual meeting two decades ago, invoked the company's place in American history then spoke of his plans. With that, he showed the mark of a new generation because he tried to sell his company's shareholders on the business case for social responsibility. ''We want to find ingenious new ways to delight consumers, provide superior returns to shareholders and make the world a better place for us all,'' Mr. Ford said. **********He said there was a link between shareholder returns and social responsibility because recent Ford market research worldwide showed that customers -- especially younger generations -- ''were demanding corporate responsibility.'' **********Mr. Ford, who became chairman on Jan. 1, said, ''We can do well for employees, customers and shareholders.'' **********And, he added, ''we can do good for society.'' **********Lest any of Ford's owners be concerned the company was not focusing enough on profits, Mr. Ford assured them that the board would consider raising its dividend later this year and would also consider a stock buyback as one way the company could lift its ''low'' price-to-earnings ratio of 11.5. Shares of Ford fell $1 today, to $63.50. **********Stock buybacks are rare at Ford, however. Analysts say that is because dividends benefit the Ford family but buybacks do not. The Ford family owns a special class of stock that gives it 40 percent of the votes at the company and does not want to cash in any of that stock in a buyback because it would dilute family control. **********Mr. Ford steered clear of controversy as he led the meeting, held at the Detroit Opera House, which Ford has helped restore. Indeed, the gray-haired audience at the Ford shareholder meeting looked much like the audience for Detroit's operas, and most who attended were just as appreciative of a good performance, particularly by the first Ford family member at the helm in 20 years. **********While a few shareholders voiced  concerns about whether Ford was doing enough for the environment, whether the company was quick enough to promote older employees and even whether it was too hard to hail a taxi here in the Motor City, most were adulatory, giving Ford an advantage where other big companies are seen as faceless global conglomerates. **********''For a person of his age, he did a very good job,'' Robert J. Dersch, 81, of Royal Oak, Mich., said after the meeting. ''I remember hearing his uncle.'' **********Marcel O. Taillieu, a Canadian shareholder and Ford buyer so loyal he had his Winnipeg Ford dealer drive to Detroit with him, said the Ford family connection made the difference. **********''In Canada we have the royal family,'' he told the young Ford chairman. ''America has the Fords.''"

A yellow earthmover, parked for the night, has cleared the weeds and grass from her small square of land on a cul-de-sac. And Ms. Ford, still in her white uniform and white shoes, walks gingerly across the dusty earth, inspecting the day's progress. **********''My boyfriend is upset about me building this house,'' said Ms. Ford, who is 29 and lives with her parents. ''He kind of wanted us to wait until we could do something together. But I didn't want to wait, and I didn't think I could. It has to do with the low interest rates and me working on my independence.'' **********Against all expectations, the housing market is continuing to boom. Around the country, home construction and sales of existing homes from January through April ran well ahead of the similar period in 1998, itself a strong year. And the slight weakening last month seems unlikely to reverse the trend unless interest rates move noticeably higher. **********Home prices are rising, too, and home ownership has reached its highest level in history: 66.7 percent of America's households. **********All this flies in the face of forecasts that housing would begin a long decline in the mid to late 1990's, once the baby boomers were past their big home-buying years. The much smaller succeeding generation, experts predicted, would buy or build many fewer homes, and prices would fall, undermining the chief investment of most Americans. Just the opposite has happened. **********The lowest sustained mortgage rates in a generation are a big reason why. In Memphis, which exhibits most of the characteristics of the national housing market, it is almost as cheap to buy or build a house as it is to rent one. Paying only $5,000 down for her $118,000, three-bedroom home, Ms. Ford snagged a 5.87 percent mortgage, which translates into payments of just $850 a month for 30 years. She thought of sharing a rental apartment with two or three friends. ''They, too, are buying their own homes,'' she said. **********But low interest rates are not the only reason housing has defied predictions. Childless single people in their 20's, like Ms. Ford and her friends, are buying more homes than anyone had ever expected. Other forces have also kicked in. Jobs are plentiful, which means that in larger households, more members are working and can contribute to home purchases. Immigrants are big buyers. Lenders are demanding down payments that are a smaller percentage of a home's cost. **********Further, federally guaranteed mortgages are more generous, with the ceiling now as high as $209,000, up from $176,000 last October. A new $500,000 tax exemption on profits from home sales fosters greater turnover of existing homes. And rising home prices have encouraged many people to move up to larger homes, often in newly built suburbs farther and farther from downtown. **********''You have not had conditions this favorable for home ownership since the 1960's,'' said Eric Belsky, executive director of the Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies, ''and people everywhere are jumping in.'' **********The rich are cashing in their stock market profits to build the million-dollar homes that are appearing in Memphis for the first time, sometimes on plots where smaller homes were torn down. And lower-income people are buying more factory-made mobile homes -- 370,000 last year -- than at any time since 1973, when baby boomer families were piling into the housing market. **********So was the forecast wrong that housing would weaken? ''The booming stock market and economy are apparently more than offsetting the depressing effects of demographics,'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. His much-quoted 1989 study, published with David N. Weil of Brown University, predicted that the 1990's would be a bad decade for housing. **********Mr. Mankiw still holds to this forecast, if not for the 1990's then soon enough. ''The demographics will persist, one would expect; they do not change quickly,'' he said. ''But the stock market and the economy do.'' **********Older Couples Turn To Small Homes **********Still, the housing boom has a demographic wind in its sails that Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Weil had not anticipated. The immigrants who arrived in waves in the 70's and 80's have become eager home buyers. Some baby boomers, renters for years, are finally buying, Harvard's Mr. Belsky says, now that low rates have made home ownership more affordable. Older couples, taking advantage of the 1997 law that exempts from taxes the first $500,000 in profit from a home sale, are increasingly selling the large houses in which they raised their children. In their place, they are purchasing smaller homes, sometimes two smaller homes, one of them a vacation retreat. **********One Memphis builder, Baum & Company, has built a whole neighborhood of three-bedroom homes on tiny plots for such customers. ''I've put up 14 of these houses and I don't think I've sold any to people with children,'' said Lee Baum, driving a visitor through Allenby Lakes, a treeless suburban development where homes are still going up near an artificial lake. ''Look,'' he said, ''there are no kids on the streets.'' **********Home construction nationwide, as a result of such trends, proceeded at an annual rate of 2.16 million units in the first quarter. Not since the mid-1980's, when many baby boomers were still in their prime home-buying years, has the number been so high. Sales of existing and recently built homes were even more robust in the first quarter, reaching an annual rate of nearly 6 million, a record. And prices are rising smartly in most of the country, including the New York City area, where home sales have jumped and new home construction has also risen, although not by as much as in other areas because of a shortage of plots. **********Minorities have been big participants in this thriving market, if not building like Ms. Ford, who is black, then buying the homes of white families who move to larger, newly built homes in the suburbs. Home ownership has risen to a record 46.9 percent of black households from 42 percent in 1992. **********Ms. Ford exudes confidence. Four years out of nursing school, with a degree in psychology, she earns $44,000 a year at Methodist Central Hospital as a nurse and nursing instructor. In a city whose unemployment rate is under 4 percent, she takes as a given that she could land another job in a minute at one of Memphis's other hospitals. **********While the house being built for her will be mid-sized, at 1,904 square feet, it will mimic the luxuries of larger homes. Vaulted ceilings and tall, arched windows will grace the dining room, living room and master bedroom. The master bath will feature a Jacuzzi bathtub, ''his'' and ''her'' sinks and a walk-in closet and dressing area. ''Soft Southern architecture,'' the builders call it. But these are features common in new housing everywhere in the United States, from mansions to cottages. **********''If you buy, you want to get what you want,'' Ms. Ford said, reflecting a preference among young people for what Juliet Schor, a Harvard economist, calls a higher level of perceived luxury than older houses offer. ''The high ceilings give the rooms a traditional style,'' Ms. Ford said. ''I am going to decorate with cherry wood and leather.'' **********State Program Helps Get a Lower Rate **********Her income qualified her for a Tennessee state mortgage program for first-time home buyers that supplements Federally guaranteed mortgages. The mortgages are currently available at a 7.23 percent interest rate, if the mortgage is less than $151,900 in the Memphis area. (The Federal ceiling was lifted in January from $128,250.) With her $5,000 down payment, she shaved the rate even further, to 5.87 percent, thanks in part to a state subsidy. And despite her boyfriend's protests, she jumped in, worried that rates would rise if she delayed. **********''He has to wake up and smell the coffee,'' she said, ''and realize that a male can still be head of a household while a woman goes ahead and takes care of the financial obligations.'' **********Her neighbors in South Pointe, a year-old development on the southeastern outskirts of metropolitan Shelby County, are mostly two-earner families -- other nurses, dealers at the crowded gambling casinos in nearby Mississippi, machine-shop workers, self-employed immigrant families, employees of Federal Express, which has opened a huge new facility nearby. Only 15 of the development's 122 homes are still unsold or not yet built, the least expensive listed at $99,990. **********''You need to be earning somewhere around $3,000 a month'' -- $36,000 a year -- ''to handle the payments on that home, assuming a 7 percent mortgage rate,'' said Preston Pittman, a salesman for Bowden Building and Design, the builders. **********America's poorest families have been largely left out of the housing surge. Households with annual incomes under $25,000 -- about one-third of the total -- generally cannot afford monthly mortgage payments on most homes here or elsewhere. That is true even with the low interest rates and the expansion of Government housing programs, according to lenders, housing experts and public officials. **********''You can put a person into a house who cannot financially make the payments, and in the long run you do that person a disservice,'' said Andrew Cuomo, Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. ''So you draw a line in the sand: For those who cannot be homeowners, how do you help them pay the rent?'' **********There is a risk to America's home-buying spree. Home construction accounts for 4.5 percent of the nation's economic activity, and 10 percent or more when all the furnishings and appliances are thrown in. This makes the national economy vulnerable to a downturn in housing. That would happen, some economists say, if mortgage rates rose above 8 percent from the present average of 7.23 percent for a 30-year mortgage. **********''There used to be a saying, that in housing demographics was destiny,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Advisers Inc., in St. Louis. ''That was always a white lie, because you knew that economics had a bearing as well, and it does now.'' **********The Market Power Of Federal Express **********As in much of the nation, the economics could not be more favorable these days in Memphis, a transportation center on the Mississippi River where Federal Express has its headquarters. Its 30,000 local employees, representing 5 percent of the area's work force, are everywhere in the housing market. ''Take them away and this market weakens,'' said Dick Leike, an owner of Crye-Leike, the city's largest realtor. **********Some FedEx employees are migrating to Collierville in the southeast, where the recently built Nonconnah Parkway has opened up a rural area to new suburban housing tracts. Near the parkway's far end, FedEx has built a huge research center, staffed so far with 2,000 people -- half the projected number -- earning $60,000 a year on average. And in the fields at either end of the modernistic campus, new homes that sell for $250,000 or more have sprung up, each on a small plot that features a patio and some shrubbery rather than much grass. **********''People don't want to be constrained by property,'' said Linda C. DeBerry, FedEx's managing director of Human Resource Development. **********That is one part of the FedEx housing market. Interview Robert B. Carter, the 39-year-old chief technology officer for FedEx's holding company, and it turns out that he occupies a category making its debut in Memphis. ''We are kind of moving up in housing,'' Mr. Carter said -- to a $1 million, 6,000 square foot, 6-bedroom home that he and his wife are building in a gated community in suburban Cordova. They are shedding a 4,000-square foot, four-bedroom home bought six years ago. **********In a city where $500,000 buys a mansion, eight homes in Memphis have been completed so far this year with a sales price of at least $1 million, compared with four new homes built for that price in all of 1998. ''Chances are we would have stayed put if we could not have built something appreciably different,'' Mr. Carter said. His stock portfolio -- particularly FedEx shares, which have doubled since last fall -- made the move possible. The new house, he said, is ''an affordable, fun project.'' **********Talk to Sally Davenport about the housing behavior of FedEx workers, and it turns out that Ms. Davenport, a FedEx media specialist, represents another national trend: the empty-nester. With her daughter in college, she has used the new $500,000 tax exemption to trade down and pocket a nice gain, tax free. Last summer, Ms. Davenport, who is 50 and earns more than $50,000 a year, sold the home in which she had raised her daughter for $137,000 and bought a smaller, three-bedroom house built only 5 years ago for $115,000. **********''I was very aware of trying to hit interest rates at just the right moment,'' she said, adding that an important attraction of her new home is ''the master bath with the Jacuzzi I always wanted and the walk-in closet I never had before.'' **********Ms. DeBerry, the FedEx human-resources executive, sees another national trend right in her own department. In the last two years, she says, she has brought in seven new staff members in their 20's -- five of them single and two married but childless -- and all have bought homes. In the past, she said, the singles would have rented. **********''I love it when they buy,'' Ms. DeBerry said, ''because that is more likely to tie them to the community and the company.''"

Summer blockbusters would have to conjure interesting dialogue. Military simulation laboratories would be tragically half-staffed, and the spectacular evolution of video game explosions would stall for at least 90 days. Because under this gargantuan roof were gathered 45,000 scientists, artists, engineers and designers whose careers are dedicated to computer graphics -- virtual reality, 3-D modeling and computer animation. **********The Siggraph (Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics) conference, now in its 26th year, started as a congregation of programmers who worked for academic research laboratories or the Defense Department (often both). Back then, the ivory tower and the Pentagon were the only institutions that financed cutting-edge computer graphics. **********The eggheads and skunk workers are still in attendance. But over the last 15 years, their mission has been subsumed by commerce, particularly by Hollywood, with the computer game industry nipping at everyone's heels. For better or worse, Jar Jar Binks represents the current state of the art in computer graphics and animation. (Our peace dividend runneth over.) **********On the Siggraph trade floor, it is not unusual to see tenured computer scientists ogling technical demonstrations by special effects studios like Digital Domain, and Industrial Light and Magic. ''Right now, there's a proposal for a $100 million research effort that would make the Defense Department joint partners with Paramount,'' said Michael Zyda, a professor at the Naval Postgraduate College who readily incorporates Doom into his discussion of networked military simulations. **********At a cocktail reception sponsored by Silicon Graphics, a company that manufactures high-end workstations, you could see the military-entertainment complex standing in line for nachos. ''We do a lot of work for the aerospace industry,'' said Bob Francis, who runs a 3-D modeling company called Surface Technologies. ''We worked with the people who did the B-2 bomber. We also did the elephant in 'Tarzan.' '' **********In Siggraph's emerging-technologies showcase, the Millennium Motel, a company called Virtual Celebrity Productions brought Marlene Dietrich back to life as a 3-D talking head, larger than life on a giant television screen in glorious black and white. ''Want to know what really seh-pa-rates zeh men from zeh boys?'' she asked. A smile played around the corners of her virtual mouth. ''Skill. It's all about skill.'' **********At its heart, Siggraph has always been a shrine to skill. At the Electronic Theater, Siggraph's annual film festival, one eye-popping display featured virtual porcelain so skillfully crafted that it shattered upon impact with the virtual floor. **********In another sequence, a computer-generated cathedral was lined with giant stone slabs, each one polished to a high sheen that accurately reflects the surrounding objects. As they fell like dominoes, subject to perfectly simulated gravity, giant  ball bearings dropped from the ceiling to reflect the whole scene with spherical distortion as they bounced down the length of the cathedral. It was an orgy of technical expertise. A thousand Ph.D.'s, software engineers and punk animators burst into applause. **********In this technological wonderland, one would not expect to find people who hate computers. But there was a whiff of technophobia at the show, particularly among the 20-somethings who haven't spent their whole lives doing basic research. For this new generation of graphics whiz kids, computer science isn't the goal. It's just a tool that allows them to get on with their art. They take the technology for granted. If it's difficult to use, they get mad at it. And at Siggraph, you could see this frustration scrawled on white boards under the escalator: **********''Down with polygons!'' **********''Your supposed 3-D world is no more than shiny silicon origami!'' **********''You have something against origami?'' **********''Origami is great, but you don't see me modeling trees with it.'' **********Looking ahead, the frontier of computer graphics is not technological. Moore's law assures us that the chips will get faster, the resolution will increase; we'll be able to generate realistic graphics on computer monitors. Lots of people will use fantastic digital images: academics, industrial designers, film directors, doctors, military strategists and game programmers with baggy shorts and blue hair. Those people use many of the same tools. But they don't share a common culture, and they don't necessarily speak the same language. **********Ultimately, the real challenge for Siggraph is to integrate those cultures, so that people who speak different design languages can learn from one another. That will require good interfaces, and making good interfaces is harder than making fast chips. **********In fact, the most popular software at Siggraph was an interface simple enough for a child to use, a 3-D modeling tool called Teddy, programmed by Takeo Igarashi at the University of Tokyo. In front of a dumbfounded audience, Mr. Igarashi sketched shapes that puffed into rotund, three-dimensional forms on the screen: a teddy bear, a fish, a bunny. On a laptop. In seconds. **********''Teddy is not a modeler for precise, careful design,'' Mr. Igarashi noted. ''It's for creating rough models instantly. This can be used by nonprofessionals. Or for rapid prototyping. Or as a communications tool, for a doctor or a teacher.'' **********Generating organically shaped 3-D models is easier than drawing with crayons. Computer graphics has arrived. **********The Siggraph home page is at www.siggraph.org. Teddy can be found at www.mtl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp /takeo/teddy/teddy.htm."

It will be a way of life. **********The mix of English and Spanish bouncing off the walls of the crowded corridors will fall silent. There will be no more lunchtime sprints for quick meals of rice and ''ropa vieja'' -- a savory Panamanian dish of shredded beef with a name meaning ''old clothes.'' **********The last of the teen-agers who have enlivened Balboa High since 1916 will pack up with their parents -- mostly American military personnel, civilian base workers or employees of the United States Government's Panama Canal Commission -- who are leaving Panama this year. **********On December 31, the United States turns the canal over to Panama, ending a relationship between the two countries that began with Panama's birth as a nation in 1903. **********The students will move to new homes -- many to the United States.

A nice home only steps away from Balboa High. A housekeeper to free him from chores. Surfing on the weekends. **********Asked whether he was deprived of anything by going to school in Panama, Mr. Bowman said no, then reconsidered. ''Well, it deprives me of a few things -- crime, having to go through metal detectors,'' he said. ''We don't have fights. We don't have drug problems. We do not have the things like what happened in Littleton, Colorado.'' **********Students here said they know each other so well -- many since infancy -- that either they or their teachers notice when one of them is acting strangely, and that fact rules out anything like Littleton. **********Even the idea of teen-age rebellion is foreign to many. Latin culture puts heavy emphasis on respect for the family, especially for one's mother. **********''If I disrespect my mom -- it's just something you don't do,'' 17-year-old Ed Sall said. **********Others added that teen-agers and adults in the United States would get along better if teen-agers were given a little more freedom. **********But to focus on that, students say, belittles the significance of Balboa's last graduation. ''It will be sad,'' Mr. Bowman said of Balboa's last graduation, ''to see more than just a school, but a lifestyle, go away.'' **********Eighty-three classes of American children have passed through the school on the shores of the Panama Canal. Eight hundred alumni have signed up to see this weekend's graduation ceremony. **********''It's like we're the last page of the book,'' 17-year-old Galen Herring said, clapping his hands shut.

Corzine, the co-chairman and chief executive, withdrawing from day-to-day management. **********Mr. Corzine, 52, ceded management responsibilities to Henry M. Paulson Jr., 52, his co-chairman and chief executive. Mr. Corzine will continue at the firm as a senior partner and nonexecutive chairman. Goldman also named John A. Thain, 43, and John L. Thornton, 45, co-chief operating officers, reporting to Mr. Paulson, a move that formally establishes them as the heirs apparent at Wall Street's last big private partnership. **********Goldman called the changes a natural evolution toward a more corporate-style management structure in line with plans to revive the public stock offering sometime this year. As part of the overhaul, Goldman named a 15-member management team consisting of division heads to replace the five partners who now make most important decisions. **********But some Goldman bankers said privately that the moves amounted to a power play by Mr. Paulson, Mr. Thain and Mr. Thornton, who seized on weak results in last year's fourth quarter to speed up a leadership transition. **********Plans for the shift were completed last week in a meeting of Goldman's executive committee, over the objections of Mr. Corzine, people at the firm said. **********Mr. Corzine, who has led Goldman since 1994 and who served as sole chairman and chief executive until he promoted Mr. Paulson to join him last May, had long envisioned promoting a team of new managers to take over some of his duties. But Mr. Corzine was opposed to a proposal to make such changes now and agreed to it only under pressure, these people said. **********Mr. Corzine, a native of Illinois noted for his relaxed demeanor and professorial speaking style, rose through the firm's cutthroat bond business and was the top executive most closely associated with its risky trading operations. Goldman had heavy trading losses, estimated at half a billion dollars, this fall. The losses caused Goldman to record an 80 percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings and pushed annual profits below the 1997 level. **********Mr. Corzine's image also suffered when Goldman delayed its much-anticipated initial public offering in September. He had shepherded the plan to go public for years, overcoming substantial opposition within the firm, but had to retreat when market conditions soured. Goldman executives stressed yesterday that the public offering would be made and that Mr. Corzine would continue to focus on preparing to sell shares in the firm. **********Mr. Paulson, in an interview yesterday, said the suggestion that his accession amounted to a palace coup was ''inaccurate in every respect.'' He said the changes had nothing to do with Goldman's trading losses or the delay in the public offering, adding that he would continue to work closely with Mr. Corzine. **********''This was an evolutionary transition in management and governance, something that made long-term sense for the firm,'' said Mr. Paulson, who earned his Goldman stripes advising companies and arranging big banking deals. ''The firm is doing very well, and we thought it made sense to put these changes in place before the public offering.'' **********Mr. Corzine said he intended to remain active at Goldman. The firm's performance in 1998 was good, he said, given the poor market conditions. ''This was a volatile period in the business, not something that's unique to Goldman, Sachs or Jon Corzine,'' he said. **********Quick shifts in leadership are not unusual on Wall Street during tough times. Mr. Corzine himself took control of Goldman in 1994, during one of the toughest years in its recent history. Merrill Lynch & Company dismissed or demoted executives in its bond and risk management division after losses in the third quarter of last year. James Dimon, the president of Citigroup, resigned under pressure after the bank's Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit had steep trading losses and the newly merged firm had difficulty integrating its operations. **********Wall Street analysts said they were surprised by the changes at Goldman. But some said there were logical reasons for the firm to want to de-emphasize trading as it prepared to go public. **********''Corzine came up from the trading side, and the trading side has not done so well,'' said Hal Schroeder, an investment banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''As you go public, the risk profile of the organization has to change. To the extent you are making this change, you need new leadership.'' **********Goldman relies much more on trading than many of its peers, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch. Those firms have larger fee-generating money-management and retail brokerage operations. In the first half of last year, which was highly profitable for Goldman, 43 percent of its profits came from trading on behalf of customers and for its own account. **********Weak earnings during last year's downturn in stock and bond markets were not unique to Goldman. Merrill had a loss in the third quarter. But Morgan Stanley powered ahead to record earnings for the fourth quarter and for the year. Lehman Brothers, which like Goldman derives the largest slice of its earnings from trading, had a smaller fourth-quarter decline than Goldman and posted record earnings for the year. **********''If you compare them to Lehman and Morgan, Goldman got the worst of it,'' said Raphael Soifer, brokerage analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. ''I'm not sure that calls for major strategic rethinking, but it has to be of some concern.'' **********The changes at Goldman indicate that Mr. Thain and Mr. Thornton are in line to take over leadership of the firm. The two have been viewed as a close team since they jointly managed Goldman's European operations in the mid-1990's. Before their promotion to chief operating officers, Mr. Thain, considered a protege of Mr. Corzine, served as chief financial officer. Mr. Thornton, who is based in London, manages Goldman's extensive international banking business. **********The two are seen as complementary. Mr. Thain, like Mr. Corzine, comes from Goldman's fixed-income division and succeeded Mr. Corzine as chief financial officer. Mr. Thornton, like Mr. Paulson, specializes in advising large companies and led the firm's highly successful push to become a big player in European and Asian investment banking. Mr. Thornton's client list includes Ford Motor, Laura Ashley and Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur. **********''This is a logical step for two strong young leaders,'' Mr. Paulson said, adding that he fully expected them to succeed him down the road. ''We like to do things in an orderly manner.'' **********Goldman insiders said that in the debate over whether to go public, Mr. Thain was seen as lukewarm to the idea and Mr. Thornton was known to be strongly opposed. But Mr. Paulson said that had changed. He emphasized that the entire management team now stands solidly behind the plan to sell shares. **********''I would be surprised if we do not go public in 1999,'' he said."

After two long negotiating sessions on Wednesday evening and today, representatives of Cathay's roughly 1,300 cockpit crew members were set to take the agreement to an extraordinary meeting of members tonight for ratification. They could not be reached for comment. **********Hong Kong's government welcomed the deal. Cathay's flight cancellations had disrupted business travel out of the city, leading some analysts to speculate that the economy could suffer. **********Mr. Tyler said the union had agreed to salary reductions for senior pilots of between 7 percent and 22 percent in return for stock options. Cathay estimates the cuts will save it roughly $1.4 billion (Hong Kong), or $180.5 million (United States), over the next 10 years. In return, it agreed to larger raises for junior pilots and to leave benefits unchanged for three years, Mr. Tyler said. **********But the most interesting concession by the carrier was an agreement to put its pilots back in cargo planes. The airline began contracting cargo flights to a subsidiary in 1995 to cut costs. The move embittered Cathay's pilots, who said it diminished their ability to accrue seniority. **********Mr. Tyler said no pilots from the subsidiary would lose their jobs with the return of the Cathay pilots. **********Even if the union ratifies the agreement, the pilots still must notify the airline of their acceptance individually by noon on Friday under a management-imposed deadline. Pilots also have the option of resigning in return for a severance bonus. **********The airline imposed the deadline late last month and threatened to lay off any pilots who refused either option. Cathay's ultimatum provoked a rash of sick leaves by pilots who said they were too anxious to fly. Analysts estimated the airline was losing $30 million (Hong Kong), or $3.9 million (United States), a day in revenue. **********Pilots had also threatened to call a strike vote if any were dismissed. That threat appears to have abated for the time being, but one analyst said the airline would not recover immediately as a work force scattered around the globe gradually returned. **********''It will obviously take some work to get the business back in operation considering so many flights were canceled,'' said Peter Negline, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. Cathay also must cancel charter flight arrangements with 13 different airlines it had made to carry passengers stranded by its pilotless planes. **********Some industry experts warned that the months of rancor had left pilots so bitter that some would choose to leave the airline on Friday despite the agreement. Even those who come back to work might still find ways to vent their frustrations. **********''Pilots who fly smart are saving an airline thousands and thousands of dollars every day,'' said Jim Eckes, managing director of Indoswiss Aviation, an airline consulting firm in Hong Kong. ''If these people lose their ambition to save the company money, Cathay will end up bearing losses that you can't point to.'' Mr. Tyler said he was confident the pilots' new stock options would keep them mindful of profits."

Sun, which had expected to lose about 17 percent of its Medicare revenue, ended up losing 30 percent. **********Analysts said the payment system, which is similar to longstanding Medicare hospital payments, has created havoc for several of the publicly traded nursing home chains, including Vencor Inc. and Mariner Health Group. Vencor said recently that it would report ''significant operating losses'' for the fourth quarter when it announces 1998 results. **********The company said it lost $761.7 million, or $13.34 a share, on revenue of $780.2 million in the fourth quarter.

The results included $95.7 million in charges to increase reserves and adjust for restructuring as well as $696 million in noncash charges, mainly to acknowledge sharp reductions in Medicare-related business. **********The company had previously said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs as part of $400 million a year in planned spending cuts. Before the cuts, it had 69,000 employees. **********Sun plans to sell 31 assisted living centers and 10 rehabilitation hospitals across the country. There are few for-profit nursing homes and hospitals in the Northeast, where for-profit health care companies face stiff legal and regulatory obstacles. **********Sun was especially vulnerable because it has the expense of carrying $2 billion of debt and convertible preferred stock and $2 billion more, which analysts call ''imputed debt,'' for facilities it effectively rents from real estate investment trusts. **********In addition, Sun's most profitable business -- supplying therapists and pharmacy services to other nursing homes -- was decimated by the Medicare changes. The company said Medicare had cut payments by 60 percent for occupational, speech and physical therapy. With the overall Medicare cuts, Sun's customers sharply reduced purchases. **********''The nursing homes can still fill beds, but maybe not as profitably,'' said Rob Mains, an analyst with Advest in Albany. Sun operates 397 nursing homes with 44,941 beds in the United States and 186 facilities in Britain, Australia, Germany and Spain. **********Sun said it lost $753.7 million, or $14.49 a share, on revenue of $3.09 billion in the 12 months ended last Dec. 31. But the company said it had $74 million in cash on hand, up $20 million from March 1, indicating positive cash flow to meet its obligations. **********''What everybody should be focusing on is cash and cash flow, and whether you can survive outside of a bankruptcy court,'' said Jeffrey C. Villwock, an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta. Sun has told analysts that some of its clients have already sought protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law. **********''Everybody is hurting badly,'' Mr. Villwock said. He said Sun and Vencor, which also leases its facilities from an investment trust it spun off, were ''closer to the brink'' than most nursing home chains. He said that Mariner still owned its facilities and had a stronger cash flow. **********Beverly Enterprises, the biggest chain, has less debt, Mr. Mains said. **********Sun said it had violated provisions of its bank debt and was in negotiations to obtain changes that would return it to compliance. **********Mr. Mains at Advest said the Medicare changes created ''sheer havoc'' for the publicly traded companies. But a number of privately held chains are ''doing fine,'' he said. In most cases, they did not sell therapy and pharmacy services to outsiders and did not push for maximum return on Medicare patients. **********Shares of Sun fell 6.25 cents to close at 87.5 cents yesterday."

Unemployment and inflation rates are at record lows, and low-paid workers are, for the first time in decades, receiving wage increases that outpace price increases. But despite the benefits of a temporarily buoyant economy, deep-seated problems remain. **********Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, notes that the best time to tackle problems is when the economy is flush. He points to increasing inequality at a time of stagnating wages in his new book, ''The New Dollars and Dreams'' (Russell Sage Foundation, 1998). Borrowing a phrase from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Mr. Levy warns against ''defining deviancy down -- accepting economic outcomes as normal today that would have been seen as pathological 10 or 20 years ago.'' **********The new year is traditionally the time for making lists. So here are five profound problems facing the American economy: **********INCOME INEQUALITY -- A study by Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan shows that from 1969 to 1997, when the earnings of college graduates rose briskly, the inflation-adjusted median earnings of white male high school graduates 25 to 34 fell nearly 30 percent. An economy that was supposed to lift everyone to new highs of income and consumption instead pushed the least skilled workers down. **********Professor Danziger points to a stunning statistic: the earnings of these less skilled white workers fell so far that they earned less in 1997 than their black counterparts, a notoriously underpaid group, had earned almost 30 years earlier. And those black male high school graduates fared almost as badly. From 1969 to 1997, their inflation-adjusted earnings fell 25 percent. **********Mr. Levy's data show that the richest one-half of 1 percent of American taxpayers account for about 11 percent of aggregate income, and about 5 percent of households take home 20 percent of total income. The share of income captured by the bottom 60 percent of households is falling. Only college graduates, about a quarter of the work force, are racking up significant wage gains. **********There is substantial evidence that the nature of technology in an information-intensive era is stacked in favor of workers with college-level verbal and math skills. That leaves at least half the work force behind. **********The United States, the richest country in history, has a fifth of its children in poverty. That this has taken place when the national unemployment rate hovers around 4.4 percent raises the question: What will happen when the next recession strikes? **********WEALTH INEQUALITY -- The only sure way for a country to grow and prosper is for its citizens to save and invest, in education, highways, research, machinery and other wealth-creating activities. But data from Edward N. Wolff of New York University show a country where few people save. That leaves them with skimpy bank accounts and meager holdings of stocks, bonds, real estate or other forms of wealth. **********Nearly 20 percent of American households, Professor Wolff contends, possess no net wealth (the value of their liabilities, like mortgage debt, offsets the value of assets) or negative net wealth (their liabilities exceed their assets). The bottom 40 percent of households control a meager two-tenths of a percent of total wealth. By contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent of households control nearly 40 percent of the total wealth. **********The picture looks even grimmer if the value of housing -- a form of wealth that cannot be bought and sold quickly and is, therefore, largely unavailable for solving many financial emergencies -- is subtracted from the calculations. By this measure, the bottom 40 percent of families have more debt than assets. And from 1983 to 1995, the poorest 40 percent of households lost 80 percent of their wealth, while the wealthiest 1 percent of households gained 17 percent. **********Members of minority groups did much worse. In 1995, Mr. Wolff reports, for example, the typical black household held only 12 percent as much wealth as the typical white household. Subtract housing, and that figure  falls to 1 percent. More than 30 percent of black households, but only about 15 percent of white households, have no net worth. **********SLUGGISH PRODUCTIVITY -- Over the long sweep of history, wages rise only about as fast as productivity -- the value of output per hour of work by all workers. If productivity rises by, say, 3 percent a year, employers can raise wages by 3 percent without sacrificing any profit. But if wages rise faster, workers' extra income can only come out of payments that would otherwise go to investors and creditors, a process that cannot continue indefinitely. **********During the halcyon days of the 1950's and 1960's, productivity rose by an average of 3 percent a year. At that rate, wages could double in 20 years or so. But since the 1970's, productivity has been crawling along at a 1 percent annual clip, taking about three times as long to double. The productivity numbers have improved recently, but there is scant evidence that the new numbers will be permanent. **********It is one thing for an economy, as is currently the case, to operate close to capacity, thereby reducing unemployment and driving up employment and wages. But to keep wages rising thereafter requires harnessing technology to expand the economy's productive capacity. **********On this score, the lessons of history are sobering. For much of the last 100 or so years, productivity has been rising at the seemingly slow pace of about 2 percent. The fast pace of the 1950's and 1960's was anomalous. At the very least, it would take stiff increases in savings and corporate investment to return the economy to fast growth, but, according to Mr. Wolff's data, Americans appear unconvinced that they need to make such sacrifices. **********EDUCATION GAP -- Investing in training and education is a possible cure for sluggish productivity and rising inequality. Indeed, the hiring practices of employers increasingly reward employees with college-level verbal and math skills, a trend caused by  skill-biased technology. In 1978, male college graduates 25 to 34 earned about 15 percent more than recent high school graduates. Now the gap is about 50 percent. **********Yet college and, therefore, access to high-income jobs remain beyond the reach of many families. In 1992, about 40 percent of high school seniors from the 25 percent poorest families did not enroll in post-secondary education. By contrast, only 10 percent of students from the 25 percent richest families failed to enroll in college or other post-secondary education. **********Employers are turning increasingly to college-educated workers. Over the last 20 years, the number of full-time workers who are college graduates has risen from about 20 percent to almost 30 percent. Many unskilled male workers have become so discouraged that they have dropped out of the labor force, increasing the fraction of nonworking male high school dropouts from about 25 percent in 1975 to 35 percent in 1995. The current employment rate of high school dropouts, 40 percent, is only about half that of college graduates. **********Given the huge earnings increase associated with college attendance, it is no surprise that college enrollments are rising. About 65 percent of whites in this country now acquire some college education. But black attendance rates are about 10 percentage points lower. Hispanic students are about four times as likely to drop out of high school as are whites. **********The obvious explanation for these wide gaps in college attendance -- the ability of the family to cover tuition and living expenses -- may not be accurate. James Heckman of the University of Chicago argues that the income of parents at the time their children leave high school has less impact on the decision to attend college than do long-term factors, such as the economic and social circumstances of the family when the child was young. The time to intervene, Professor Heckman argues, is early in a child's life. **********TATTERED SAFETY BLANKET -- Millions of adults have dropped out of the labor force  because they cannot afford to replace their Government-paid health insurance with a private policy. Nor can they afford day care for their young children. The percentage of the population without health insurance has risen to about 16 percent and is nudging higher. An ominous trend is that workers are increasingly turning down offers by employers for insurance. **********The economy has turned quickly and viciously against unskilled workers, leaving many of their families adrift. Fifty years ago, low-paid workers could seek their fortunes by migrating out of Southern agricultural areas and into Northern manufacturing cities. Today, escape routes are far more difficult to find. As Mr. Levy of M.I.T.  notes, ''getting an education is harder than getting on a bus.''"

He was running the global computer systems for a 150-year-old British bank and earning $300,000 a year. **********Then, in April, he did something that seemed contrary to everything Singapore Inc. stood for: he quit. Not to join another multinational company for more money, but to start a tiny high-technology company here with three other entrepreneurs -- a college buddy, a Japanese paraglider and a digital tinkerer who had helped authorities put urine detectors in Singapore's elevators. **********Even stranger, the Government -- notorious for central planning and ironclad control -- wishes there were more people here like Mr. Lim. **********Singapore is already a center for making high-technology hardware -- it is, for example, the world's largest producer of computer disk drives. And through the 90's, the Government has been plotting to make it an ''intelligent island,'' a networked city that would be Asia's Silicon Valley. **********But now, Singapore is peering into the Internet age and facing a quandary. **********On one hand, less-developed neighbors with cheaper labor are taking away high-tech manufacturing jobs, even as virtual communities and borderless trade are eroding the advantages of geography and infrastructure that helped create cities like Singapore in the first place. **********On the other, experts say, the creative germ that Singapore needs in order to compete in the information economy has been suffocated by the traditional Confucian culture and heavy Government control that form the bedrock of the city-state's society. **********So the Government that for 34 years has micromanaged the economy, censored the media and brooked no dissent has now embarked on a far-reaching program to enliven Singapore, largely in the hope of encouraging independent-minded business people like Mr. Lim and his partners. **********''We must create an environment where creative ideas and entrepreneurship can come about,'' said Teo Ming Kian, chairman of the National Science and Technology Board, which oversees Technopreneurship 21, one of several Government projects intended to prepare Singapore for the new century. **********Otherwise, he said, ''we could not be as relevant to the world as we'd like to be.'' **********Critics say the plan is contrived, that ingenuity cannot be mandated from the top down. But the authorities here hope that by giving their laws, taxes and even school curriculums a more casual fit, they can lure foreign role models and synthesize a new breed of innovative Singaporean. As an added incentive, the Government has ponied up $1 billion to kick-start new companies like Mr. Lim's. **********Now if only Mr. Lim could get some of it. **********His fledgling business, Pixelmetrix, aims to make equipment that will let digital television broadcasters monitor picture quality. Mr. Lim and his partners have lined up a customer in Japan and pitched in around $71,000 to rent an office and start work. Having chosen Singapore over California  and Japan for its tax breaks and financing potential, Pixelmetrix is hunting for $1 million in venture capital. **********But its founders are discovering something that has driven a number of Singapore's ''technopreneurs'' to Silicon Valley and that threatens to make the Government's campaign a slow and difficult one: Few Singaporeans even want to work for a start-up, let alone invest in one. **********''There has to be a change in the mentality in the market that encourages people to take risks -- and risk big,'' said Scott Desmarais, a management consultant here with the Boston Consulting Group. **********From Port to Ports **********It wasn't always this way. The seafaring southern Chinese who settled in Singapore in the 1800's, eventually becoming the largest ethnic group here, risked everything, crossing pirate-infested seas to reach a tiger-infested British free port in the Straits of Malacca. Life in Singapore remained perilous into the 1960's, with the city notorious for its gang-ridden streets, fetid slums and simmering racial tensions. **********When Singapore was ejected from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965 and became independent, many people doubted that it could survive. But the Peoples Action Party of Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister, who served until 1990 and is still a voice of authority here, put a firm lid on opposition and began a program of urban renewal and pro-business reform that turned a squalid Singapore into a humming industrial Shangri-La. **********Slums were cleared for charmless but immaculate public housing. Residents could buy their new apartments with Government-mandated savings, turning them into stakeholders in Mr. Lee's new venture. Social engineering by the Government also extended to matters like child-bearing, courtesy and clean public toilets, and the results are difficult to ridicule: incomes here are on par with those in Western Europe. **********''We've always had it drummed into us that we have nothing -- no water, nothing, only our talent, our people,'' said T. K. Wong, 32, who returned from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991 to work for the Government and later started one of Singapore's earliest Internet companies, Silkroute Ventures. The company has evolved from developing on-line content to designing company Web sites and dreaming up new Internet businesses. **********Singapore's growing affluence drew Mr. Lim here from Toronto in 1985. Originally from Malaysia, his family had gone to Canada in 1975 as Communists took over Vietnam and Southeast Asia's future looked dim. In Singapore, Mr. Lim started out at a local securities firm, then turned his computer engineering degree from the University of Alberta into a lucrative career in financial technology, moving to Andersen Consulting, Deutsche Bank and then Standard Chartered Bank, where he was in charge of its global networks and its Internet plans. **********On a trip to Japan last fall, Mr. Lim visited a former classmate, Danny Wilson, who was working for Hewlett-Packard in Kobe. Over numerous cups of sake, the two groused about big-company life and discussed their own entrepreneurial ambitions. While steeping in a local hot spring, Mr. Lim convinced Mr. Wilson to draw up a business plan for Pixelmetrix. **********The two men also recruited one of Mr. Wilson's colleagues from Hewlett-Packard, Hideki Takahashi, 34, an engineer and a paraglider. Mr. Takahashi said he would be happy to join their new company -- provided that they didn't base it in Japan, with its bureaucracy and high prices. **********Mr. Lim suggested Singapore, which had become a digital convert 10 years earlier at the original source of its wealth, its port. In 1989, it installed a computer network linking shippers, suppliers and freight forwarders to Singapore's port authority. The time for processing customs declarations and permits fell from three days to less than three minutes. Tradenet, as the system was called, became a Harvard Business School case study. **********Two years later, the Government asked a group of young technocrats, including Mr. Wong of Silkroute, to draft a more comprehensive plan. The result was IT2000, a plan that envisioned a nationwide network connecting every citizen and turning Singapore into a way station for information -- in short, a cyberport. Today, half of Singapore's homes have a personal computer and one of every four Singaporeans uses the Internet, according to the National Computer Board. **********Big Plans or Big Brother? **********The project has Orwellian overtones to many, an impression reinforced by the fact that Singapore's Internet services are required to block access to some Web sites that are deemed pornographic. Public misgivings were heightened this year when the news emerged that the Government's internal security agency had covertly inspected some Web surfers' computers, looking for  hackers. **********IT2000 also outpaced the public's technological appetite, something that critics say is typical of state-planned technological development. The project's flagship is a $60 million high-speed fiber-optic backbone called Singapore ONE (for One Network for Everyone). The Government offered millions of dollars for developers to take advantage of the project, and even set up offices in San Francisco. **********''Everybody and their mother came in, but there was nothing of strong value,'' said a consultant who advised the Government on the project. While Singapore ONE reaches 99 percent of Singapore homes, only 60,000 of the country's 3.2 million people use it. **********Michael Yap, chairman of the National Computer Board, defends the network. ''We knew it wasn't commercially viable,'' he said. ''Industry couldn't go on its own, so we decided to share the risk.'' **********The Rules Meet Reality **********Such Government-knows-best attitudes, however, may have hobbled Singaporeans' ability to come up with their own solutions. **********''The people I hire are too obedient,'' complained Louis Woo, a former Apple Computer executive from Macao who in 1997 formed a company here to make Chinese-language voice-recognition software. Last year, he sold a half-interest to Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products of Belgium. **********Obedience has been taught from the time small children put on their school uniforms and line up like soldiers for morning assembly. The Government ranks schools by how pupils perform on standardized tests, and parents vie to send their children to the best, so pressure is high on both students and teachers to produce top scores. The same atmosphere, Mr. Woo and other employers say, has turned universities into factories for midlevel managers. **********Eng-Siong Tan, a Singaporean who last year helped found a Web software company here called Third Voice, recalled his surprise on his first day at Purdue University  in Indiana back in 1984, when counselors asked him what courses he wanted to take. **********''In Singapore,'' he said, ''they tell you your courses, they tell you your schedule and they tell you what books to buy.'' **********Outside experts agree that group-think may hamper the city-state in the information age. ''The thing that's going to stop Singapore more than anything is that its educational system is still not targeted at turning out people who question what they're taught,'' said David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computing expert who visits Singapore regularly and is an adviser to the Government. **********Point taken: In elementary schools, teachers are starting to take into account students' performance on projects, instead of basing their grades entirely on exam scores. Universities are reducing their emphasis on standardized tests and -- a liberalizing step here -- are introducing the American S.A.T., which is meant to evaluate students' analytical skills, not just their powers of recall. **********''We cannot produce adaptable, innovative and creative students unless we have adaptable, creative and innovative teachers and schools,'' said Education Minister Teo Chee Hean in 1997, as he announced a new Government policy called Thinking Schools. **********Impetus for Change **********Last February, Mr. Wilson came to scout the city that Mr. Lim was proposing as their company's springboard. The Government offered grants, tax breaks and employment visas, but he still hesitated. For one thing, Mr. Wilson had been admitted to the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For another, his Japanese wife loves flamenco dancing -- a surprisingly popular activity in Japan but all but unheard of in Singapore. ''I'd been to Singapore before,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''It's a little boring.'' **********Of course, Singapore has a lot going for it. Green, clean and efficient, it is not prone to hurricanes or earthquakes or tornadoes, and schools do not need metal detectors. A short flight away are some of the world's best beaches and tropical reefs. Still, the most common compliment from foreign residents is one that would apply to a sleepy suburb: It's a great place to raise children. **********To entice foreigners to supplement its own pool of talent, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has called on Singapore to become more cosmopolitan. ''Having fun is important,'' he said. ''If Singapore is a dull, boring place, not only will talent not want to come here, but even Singaporeans will begin to feel restless.'' **********Old habits die hard, however. When Singapore decided to legalize street performances in 1997, artists were required to audition and to donate any money collected to charity. The Government recently lifted a ban on audience participation, but the streets remain largely busker-free. **********By March, Mr. Wilson had set aside his qualms and given up his plans to attend M.I.T. Mr. Lim said goodbye to Standard Chartered. And Mr. Takahashi began searching elsewhere in Southeast Asia for cliffs to leap from. **********They brought aboard another University of Alberta alumnus, Tom Orlowski. Mr. Orlowski, 33, was already in Singapore, with a company that had developed a solution to a problem in Singapore's public housing. Now, if someone urinates inside an elevator here, the elevator shuts down and police are notified, thanks to the Urine Detection Device, which Mr. Orlowski helped invent. **********Singapore may be no Manhattan, but Mr. Orlowski, who grew up in Edmonton, doesn't pretend to be an urban sophisticate. ''I'll never need to be in New York,'' he said. **********Some foreigners, however, may be disinclined to move to a nation that Freedom House, a human rights group based in Washington, calls only ''partially free,'' with political rights and civil liberties on a par with Haiti, Kuwait or Malaysia. **********After all, while Singapore discusses easing censorship, some less puritanical Asian business centers, like the Philippines and Hong Kong, are wooing high-tech investors to their own Silicon Valleys. Perhaps Singapore's most serious competition comes from Malaysia. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, has promised that in his Multimedia Super Corridor -- the high-tech city he is building in what was once a stretch of oil-palm plantations -- night life will not have to shut down at 3 A.M. as it does in Singapore, and authorities will not censor the Internet. **********The corridor's rising profile and layoffs by big electronics companies here during the Asian financial crisis convinced the Singapore Government that it needed to do more to compete. **********''We've been really good at attracting brick-and-mortar businesses,'' Mr. Yap said. ''But given the transformation into E-business, we need to rethink what's needed.'' **********Bridging a Gap **********In July, the Government started Technopreneurship 21. In addition to the $1 billion venture fund for technology companies, the plan makes it harder to bankrupt small companies, decreases taxes on stock options, makes it easier for foreign entrepreneurs to obtain entry visas and allows taxpayers to deduct losses on investments in high-tech start-ups. It even lets aspiring Bill Gateses run their start-ups out of Government-built apartments. **********But Friday the 13th of August nonetheless found Mr. Lim dejected. After being shuffled from office to office, he was finally told that the Government was simply overwhelmed with applications. **********Officials promised to line up some potential private investors, but Mr. Lim was skeptical. ''Looks like were on our own,'' he said. **********In fact, it's unclear how much Technopreneurship 21 has achieved in its first two months. Officials of the National Science and Technology Board said fewer than 10 companies had received financing under the program so far. The experience of another program, the Technology Incubator Program, doesn't augur well: After fielding 149 inquiries since its creation a year ago, it has approved assistance for only four start-ups. **********''There's a huge gap between entrepreneurs with an idea and reaching the money,'' said Mr. Wong of Silkroute, who moved the headquarters of his new E-commerce venture, Advanced Manufacturing Online, to Silicon Valley. **********Perhaps, though, the Government is learning from its mistakes. Acknowledging earlier this month that it knows little about assessing the prospects of young high-tech companies, it decided to let more savvy venture capitalists determine how to use its $1 billion fund. Specifically, the science board will invest $250 million alongside private investors and venture capital funds. The remainder will be used by the Singapore Government Investment Corporation, which is responsible for investing Singapore's foreign reserves, to buy into venture capital funds that invest in Singapore and to develop venture-capital ties overseas. **********Still, start-ups being what they are, the path for Pixelmetrix will not be easy. Some venture capitalists have rejected its projected $67 million in revenue by 2003 as not worth the paperwork. Another obstacle, Mr. Wilson said, is that ''we're no dot.com.'' **********The science board has found a so-called angel investor, a local set-top box maker, interested in investing in Pixelmetrix, with the board coming in as a co-investor. The devil is in the details. **********''If I sell it cheap enough,'' Mr. Lim said after an initial meeting, ''they're in.'' **********As negotiations drag on, he has had to resort to a different source to tide the company over, one familiar to company founders in America as well: He's borrowing from a bank against his home."

Y.& R. -- the world's No. 4 agency company in billings, at $14.7 billion, and No. 5 in revenue, at $1.7 billion -- already works for big advertisers including Cadbury Schweppes, Citigroup, Colgate-Palmolive and Sears, Roebuck. **********''Y.& R. will be a marketing partner, which is a very exciting opportunity for us that could grow in a number of different directions down the road,'' said Arie L. Kopelman, president and chief operating officer at Chanel Inc. in New York. **********''I'll coin a phrase, 'marketing oversight,' to describe what Y.& R. will do for us,'' he added, ''making sure we move in the right directions at the right rates of speed.'' **********The cosmetics and fragrance industry ''has never been more competitive than now,'' Mr. Kopelman said. ''There's enormous consolidation, like all the brands Estee Lauder is buying, and new channels of distribution like the Sephora stores.'' **********''The pace is so intense, we don't often have the time to stop and think at some level of depth about making sharp, sure-footed moves for the future,'' he added. ''Y.& R. brings an objective, third-party way of thinking that we need.'' **********Effective Jan. 1, Chanel Inc. is awarding the responsibilities for media planning and buying on its account to the Media Edge, the media services unit of Y.& R.; billings are estimated at $25 million to $30 million. Those duties had been handled by Optimum Media in New York, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. **********Other units of Y.& R. will serve as consultants to Chanel Inc. on branding and what the company described as ''select new marketing initiatives.'' Mr. Kopelman declined to elaborate, but cited as an example a recent campaign created in-house for Precision, a line of cosmetics being marketed with ''a very scientific approach'' compared with the glamour and glitz traditionally associated with Chanel products. **********''On a project like that, Y.& R. can bring a lot to the party,'' Mr. Kopelman said, ''an extra dimension of thinking.'' **********Mr. Kopelman traced the relationship with Y.& R. to what he described as a chance meeting about a year ago with Ted Bell, vice chairman and worldwide creative director at Y.& R. Advertising; the two had once worked together at DDB. **********''He mentioned, in a very casual way, this research Y.& R. does on brand assets,'' Mr. Kopelman said, referring to the agency's Brand Asset Valuator, which assesses the strengths and weaknesses of major brands based on research among consumers around the world, weighing attributes like relevance, popularity, esteem and differentiation. **********After Y.& R. executives presented a valuation of the Chanel brand assets, ''there were some dimensions we hadn't thought about in our own research,'' he added. ''Relevance, for example: You can have all the right images, but how relevant is a brand to a consumer's life? Can the consumer identify with it?'' **********Peter A. Georgescu, chairman and chief executive at Y.& R., said the brand research exemplified the ''new focus on the consumer.'' **********''In this world of excess supply rather than excess demand, the consumer is more than ever the driving force,'' he added. Discussing the affluent, style-conscious women who buy Chanel products, he said: ''For instance, for Chanel, not every woman is their customer; the Chanel customer's needs are different. Understanding her special nature is crucial.'' **********Stephanie Kugelman, chairwoman and chief executive at the New York office of Y.& R. Advertising, will also work on the marketing tasks for Chanel Inc. **********The creative responsibilities for the Chanel Inc. account continue in-house. The company also collaborates with creative executives who work for the French parent, like Jacques Helleu, artistic director at the Chanel couture house, and the directors Luc Besson and Jean-Paul Goude. Chanel Inc. has also occasionally used outside agencies like AG Worldwide in New York, formerly Arnell Group Brand Consulting, as creative resources. **********Asked if the role Y.& R. is playing will expand someday to encompass tasks like creative or media services outside the United States, Mr. Kopelman replied: ''This is a business where it's all a moving target. What Y.& R. does down the road for us, who knows?'' **********For now, Mr. Kopelman said, laughing, if all the Y.& R. services are ''the whole egg'' -- a phrase the agency company used years ago to describe the breadth of its offerings -- ''we're the egg-white omelette.''"

The Web broadcast is a first in the short film category, a spokesman for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences said. **********''Bunny'' is a seven-minute story about a rabbit's battle with a moth who has invaded her kitchen. The film was written and directed by Chris Wedge, the creative director of Blue Sky Studios, which makes animation effects for television commercials and feature films. **********Mr. Wedge said that making the film had gone hand in hand with the company's development of software to create more realistic lighting effects. ''Our simulation takes into account the complexity of light as it is reflected off of different surfaces,'' Mr. Wedge said. ''For example, when you step from the curb onto the grass on a bright day, it looks natural to your eyes.

Removes Itself From Industrial Pedestal,BUSINESS: DIARY; G.M. Removes Itself From Industrial Pedestal," **********Though often misquoted and taken out of context, a remark by Charles E. Wilson that ''for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa,'' has long stood for the view that the business of America is very big business, so get out of the way. **********Whatever G.M.'s president was driving at in 1953, if he made the comment today it would have to be ''What's good for Ford Motor is good for America.'' **********Last week, G.M. finished spinning off its giant Delphi parts division, reducing revenues enough to slip behind Ford on the list of the world's largest industrial corporations. G.M. had been No. 1 at least since the 1930's and has sold more vehicles than Ford since 1931. (That, at least, is unlikely to change soon, despite Ford's purchase of Volvo's car business.) **********Here is the arithmetic: G.M. had 1998 revenues of $161.3 billion; deducting Delphi's $6.2 billion of non-G.M. business leaves it with $155.1 billion. For Ford, start with $144.4 billion, subtract $1.7 billion for Associates First Capital, which it sold, and add Volvo's car business (roughly $13 billion) and Kwik-Fit Holdings, a newly acquired chain of European repair shops (almost $1 billion), and you get about $157 billion. Ford wins by a nose. **********Ford's tenure in the top spot may prove short. The company has considered spinning off Visteon Automotive Systems, its parts-making equivalent of Delphi. Without Visteon, the Ford-G.M. revenue race is a dead heat.   JAMES G. COBB"

P. Tods and Hogans loafers, shoes and bags. **********Last week, Diego Della Valle increased its stake in Church to 8.6 percent from 6.3 percent, compared with 8.5 percent for Prada, and the two companies were seen as rival suitors. Prada's offer represents a 20 percent premium to Church's share price of 790 pence before the company announced last week that it was in talks with a potential buyer, which it did not identify. **********Shares of Church dropped 32.5 pence, to 960, still above the offer price, when investors saw no immediate sign of a counteroffer from Diego Della Valle. Mr. Della Valle, the owner of the company that bears his name, did not respond to a request for comment. He said earlier that he was interested in Church, which is based in the Northampton, but ''not at any price.'' **********The directors of Church have formally accepted the Prada offer and said they would urge shareholders to accept it. But under the terms of the deal, Church is free to accept a rival offer if it surpasses Prada's bid by 5 percent. **********Although its price is minuscule by the standards of modern mergers, the deal reflects the cachet and fascination of luxury items in an era when booming stock markets and incomes have broadened a pool of big-spending consumers. **********''In the last few years, with some exceptions, the market has been growing very fast because of stock market growth and earnings growth,'' said Davide Vimercati, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. **********It has been a distinctive kind of growth because, by and large, manufacturers of luxury shoes, clothes, watches, handbags and accessories fear they will dilute brands based on high price and exclusivity if they expand them too far or too quickly. **********''Companies that have critical mass generate a lot of free cash, so it's natural that they would look for external growth,'' said Cedric Magnelia, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. Prada's bid for Church comes after recent purchases of the fashion designers Jil Sander A. G. in Germany and Helmut Lang in New York. The acquisitions show that the company, based in Milan, is squaring off with rivals like Gucci Group N.V. and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A. in a contest to gather smaller luxury brands together under one, glittering roof. **********Gucci did not comment today on a newspaper report that it had offered  $711 million for Fendi S.p.A. **********Prada and Diego Della Valle have markedly different market profiles. While Prada cultivates a fashion-setting image, Diego Della Valle is viewed as offering a more traditional range of loafers at about $200 a pair and other shoes and boots for about $260. Both hail, though, from a culture that, in its quest for bella figura -- an exquisite appearance at all times -- reveres shoes in general and has particular regard for high-quality, conservative-looking English shoes. Church, whose classic brogues and Oxford shoes sell in England for upward of $320 a pair, is also seen as having a following among the business-and-banking set in the United States. Among its 155 outlets, Church has stores in Italy, the United States, France, Belgium, Hong Kong and Canada. **********Patrizio Bertelli, Prada's chief executive, indicated he was buying the mystique of a British brand. ''Should our offer be successful, it is my firm intention to maintain and possibly strengthen the British identity of Church by preserving and developing its industrial presence in Northampton and by enhancing the role of the management team,'' he said. **********In recent years, analysts said, Church has lost some of its luster as a luxury brand, partly because it has lagged rival shoemakers in marketing and distribution. **********''A company like Prada knows how to revitalize the brand to give Church back the image of luxury and exclusivity,'' said Mr. Vimercati at Salomon Smith Barney."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/07/world/pope-tells-poles-of-modern-martyrs.html,Alessandra Stanley,1999-06-07,"Pope John Paul II visits Pelplin, Poland, part of his homeland that was annexed into German Reich during World War II; reminds Poles that Christian martyrdom continued well into this century, noting that 303 pastors were taken from land of Pelplin...",787,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Pope Tells Poles of Modern Martyrs,Pope Tells Poles of Modern Martyrs," **********Visiting a part of his homeland that was annexed into the German Reich during World War II, John Paul II reminded Poles today that Christian martyrdom continued well into this century. **********''Three hundred and three pastors were taken from the land of Pelplin, and at the cost of their lives heroically testified to the message of hope in the dramatic period of war and occupation,'' the Pope told 300,000 people gathered on a hill outside the small town of Pelplin. ''If today we remember these martyred priests, it is because it was from their lips that our generation heard the word of God.'' **********The 79-year-old Pope, who arrived in nearby Gdansk on Saturday for a 13-day visit to his homeland, is tending to his Polish flock 10 years after the fall of Communism and is also  underlining the themes of his papacy as he prepares to usher the Roman Catholic Church into the third millennium. **********His persistent theme of reconciliation and a new evangelization are the core of his message. But as a Pole who studied for the priesthood underground during the Nazi occupation and witnessed the deportation of priests and of his own university professors, he has long sought to remind the world of the persecution of Catholics during the war. **********The region around Pelplin was particularly hard-hit: 46 percent of its priests died in concentration camps, the highest rate in Poland. Next Sunday, the Pope is planning to beatify 108 Catholics who were killed by the Nazis and who have been declared martyrs for their faith. **********The Pope's focus on Catholic suffering has angered many Jewish groups, which complain that the Vatican is seeking to ''Christianize'' the Holocaust and to deflect attention from the many instances of Catholic collaboration with the Nazis. **********John Paul has sought throughout his papacy to reconcile Jews and Christians. He visited Auschwitz on his first papal visit to Poland 20 years ago. Last year, the church issued a long-awaited document on the Shoah, a public act of contrition for some Catholics' failure to resist the Nazi persecution of Jews. But many Jewish organizations maintain that his legacy is still mixed. **********While in Warsaw, the Pope will pay his respects to the Jews who perished in extermination camps during the war by praying at a newly erected monument to the victims of the Holocaust in central Warsaw. Shortly before his arrival, the Polish Government removed the hundreds of crosses that had been erected at Auschwitz by Catholic militants, in defiance of the Polish bishops and the Vatican; the crosses had long been a source of conflict between Jews and Catholics. **********The Pope evoked World War II and its aftermath more than once today.  He also held an evening prayer service in Elblag, a small town near the border with Russia. Among the 200,000 people who came to see him were Roman Catholics from Lithuania and also from Russia -- mostly from Kaliningrad, which was German for 700 years, was absorbed by the Soviet Union after the war and remains, edgily, a part of Russia. **********There was also a small delegation of Russian Orthodox believers. The Pope has sought to mend the schism between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, but Patriarch Aleksy II of Russia has so far resisted rapprochement. When the Pope welcomed the Orthodox visitors by name, the crowd applauded. **********''We are all dreaming of the day when the Pope can come to Russia and set foot on Red Square,'' Bishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, the Apostolic Administrator of Moscow, said before the Mass. **********Today, basking in a warm sun and the applause and cheers of fellow Poles, the Pope also dwelled on happier memories. He departed from his prepared text toward the end both appearances. At one point in Elblag, he playfully told the crowd that was shouting ''Niech Zyje Papiez!'' or ''Long live the Pope!'' that their chant reminded him of a time when a follower mistakenly cried out, ''Eupiez,'' which in Polish rhymes with ''Papiez,'' but which is actually the word for dandruff. **********He grew nostalgic in Pelplin,  where he long ago kayaked in the Brda River. ''I adore the beauty of this region,'' he told the crowd. **********Many in the audience could remember seeing the Pope when he was a vigorous outdoorsman. Today, they could not help but notice how age and illness have taken their toll.  Though his mood was often ebullient and he spoke clearly, his body was stooped and his left hand trembled uncontrollably -- something that may be caused by Parkinson's disease. **********The Bishop of Pelplin, Jan Bernard Szlaga, made a rare public mention of the Pope's suffering. ''The faithful came here to be together with you, Holy Father, who have been bearing a cross every day,'' he said."

Software in the 1980's. Biotechnology in 1991. The Internet in 1999. **********Roughly once a decade, as some emerging technology reaches critical mass, start-up companies rush to cash in on the ensuing enthusiasm by selling their stock to the public. **********On Wall Street, where nothing succeeds like excess, investment bankers take a Darwinian view of these frenzies, pushing as many companies as possible through the financing process while the public's appetite is whetted but before it is sated. **********This year, it is a feast. The eager Internet start-ups are so numerous that investment banks tell of having to turn away potential clients while some companies have resorted to trying creative methods to whisk their documents through regulatory approvals. A company might list itself in the transportation industry, for example, if it plans to sell airline tickets over the Internet. **********Barring a midsummer market collapse, more than 100 newly public companies might be competing for the attention of investors before the usual August break of investment bankers, finance professionals say. **********''We've certainly seen other booms, but we've never seen anything like this,'' said Kenneth R. Fitzsimmons, director of capital markets at BancBoston Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco firm that has been one of the biggest underwriters of Internet stock offerings in the last six months. ''The market is far more frenetic, and companies are getting higher absolute valuations than ever before.'' **********The bankers typically scrutinize a company's financial condition and business plan, and they promise to provide coverage of the stock once trading starts. **********Compared with past frenzies, this one is extreme in several ways. Internet-related businesses already account for a bigger portion of the total number of new issues than biotechnology companies ever did, and these new stocks are rising higher and faster than anything in recent memory. **********While individual investors and day traders are contributing to the activity, institutional investors like mutual and pension funds are also eagerly chasing companies that many of them would have previously dismissed as speculative. And those big investors, ever mindful of investors' high expectations, are holding onto their shares longer, dampening supply and reinforcing the upward rise of many Internet stocks. **********All this interest is putting some strains on the initial-offering system, which usually steers the public's money only to the most promising companies. Jesus Cabrera, who oversees the State Street Emerging Growth fund, says so many Internet companies are jockeying to go public that he cannot make it to all the ''road shows,'' the presentations at which company managers and their bankers use to describe the company's prospects. **********His solution: Watch some of the road shows over the Internet, on a service called Netroadshow.com. **********''I place value in meeting companies in person so I can see the whites of their eyes,'' Mr. Cabrera said. ''But if I tried to go to them all, I wouldn't have a life,'' or much time to manage a $100 million mutual fund. **********Portfolio managers might take comfort in knowing that it has been hard to lose money investing in an Internet public offering in the last year. The point was driven home again on Friday, when shares of  USInternetworking, iTurf and Extreme Networks each jumped more than 100 percent from their offering prices in their first day of trading. **********Such leaps are typical of the more than two dozen Internet-related companies that have completed initial offerings so far in 1999, and an improvement over the performance of similar offerings last year. Mr. Fitzsimmons said his research shows that Internet offerings jumped nearly 70 percent, on average, in their first day of trading last year. **********It is not surprising, then, that Internet-related deals seem to be pushing other offerings aside. According to Thomson Financial Securities Data, almost a quarter of the initial public offerings so far this year have been for Internet-related companies, up from less than 10 percent last year. In 1991, when biotechnology companies were all the rage, those concerns represented about 20 percent of new issues. **********The $9.4 billion raised in all types of new public offerings in the first quarter of this year was a record, leading many on Wall Street to believe that 1999 could follow the path set in 1991, when a hot market for biotechnology offerings led to a record year for underwriters. **********Investors, meanwhile, have shrugged at high-profile deals that in past years would have dominated headlines. Consider the two biggest companies to complete recent initial public offerings -- Pepsi Bottling Group and Delphi Automotive Systems. **********On March 30, Pepsi Bottling, the largest bottler and seller of Pepsi products, completed the largest initial public offering this year by selling $2.3 billion of its shares at $23 apiece. The shares sank more than a point their first day of trading and have since fallen further, closing at $21.4375 on Friday. **********Delphi Automotive, which makes auto components and systems, sold $1.7 billion of shares at $17 apiece in early February. Though the shares have spent most of their time at $18 or more, they have recently slipped to less than the offering price, closing at $17.4375 on Friday. **********''The current I.P.O. market is significantly more concentrated in one sector than I've ever seen it,'' said Scott Sipprelle, a co-founder of the Midtown Research Group, which tracks initial offerings, and the former head of the equity capital markets division of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. **********That might be diverting money away from promising companies in other industries. Global Markets Access, an insurer based in Hamilton, Bermuda, had planned to raise $244 million in an initial offering to be underwritten by Merrill Lynch & Company and Prudential Securities but withdrew its offering on March 31, citing market conditions. **********It certainly is straining the lives of bankers, lawyers, accountants, printers and others who keep the I.P.O. machine running. **********''We've never been this busy, and we're turning things down,'' said Mr. Fitzsimmons of BancBoston Robertson Stephens. While the firm's committee that reviews underwritings has always rejected some deals because of poor quality, ''we're having to pick and choose the deals we do much more now,'' he said, citing the high volume. **********Perhaps of greatest concern to investors, however, is the relative shortage of analysts who understand and can follow the Internet companies once they begin trading. There is an almost endless supply of potential Internet companies -- which are often little more than a business plan and some financial projections. But few analysts can make sense of both Internet technology and the economic models that will lead to success on the new medium. **********David Readerman, a software and Internet analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco investment bank, notes that while nearly every investment bank has at least two or three bankers working on Internet-related offerings, they have one securities analyst, at most, to follow the companies once the stock is trading. **********Analysts will play a far more important role in following Internet companies, Mr. Readerman said, than they did in, say, the biotechnology boom,. In the Food and Drug Administration, biotechnology companies had, an outsider to rule on their products' ultimate success or failure. But determining the prospects of an Internet company is more prophesy and conjecture. **********People involved in bringing Internet companies to market also complain of a bottleneck at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must review a company's disclosure documents before granting approval to sell shares. **********Investment bankers say the initial review, which is supposed to be completed within 30 days, is taking closer to six weeks. Chris Ullman, an S.E.C. spokesman, denied that backlog; he said that while the average time for review of a filing for initial public offerings had recently been 31 to 33 days, it has now returned to 30 days. **********In Silicon Valley there is talk that the fastest way to get an Internet business to market is to pretend it's not an Internet company. When companies register with the S.E.C., the documents are initially routed within the agency to industry experts based on the company's Standard Industrial Classification code, a four-digit number indicating the industry in which the company does business. **********Investment bankers and other Wall Street professionals say that companies have recently been tweaking their industry codes to avoid the queues numbered in the 7370's, which denotes computer systems and software. **********That queue has been used by a wide variety of companies, including Priceline.com, which sells discounted airline tickets over the Internet. But two other companies in a similar business -- Lowestfare.com and Cheap Tickets Inc. -- used the codes for transportation services and general business services, respectively. **********Mr. Ullman said that whatever code a company initially files under, the S.E.C. will determine the correct industry and route the filing accordingly. In other words, he advised companies, don't try it. **********Companies still cannot get their offerings to the market quickly enough, in part because they fear missing the opportunity before the financing window closes. **********Investment managers, on the other hand, cannot seem to buy quickly enough, showing little regard for the outsized valuations at which Internet companies are going public. **********''I had lunch with a mutual fund manager the other day and asked if he'd played in these Internet I.P.O.'s,'' said L. Keith Mullins, who tracks small companies at Salomon Smith Barney. ''He said he had, so I asked if he could give me a fundamental reason to own any of these stocks at these prices. He said no. But he added, 'That's what's working right now.' '' **********Indeed, George S. Shirk 3d, managing editor of the New Issues newsletter, said his publication has recommended that investors ''flip,'' or sell on the first day of trading, nearly every Internet I.P.O. that has come to market this year -- provided that an investor can get shares at the initial offering price, as institutions  can but individuals usually cannot. **********''We're not seeing a lot that we would recommend for a long-term investor,'' he said, particularly after trading begins and the stock has already more than doubled. **********Though individual investors may be left out of the earliest part of the game, institutions are jumping into deals that, in the not-so-distant past, would have drawn little enthusiasm. **********''Demand by institutional investors has gotten much higher because those managers want to show these stocks in their portfolios at the end of each quarter,'' said Linda Killian, who herself manages a mutual fund that invests in new offerings, the IPO Plus Aftermarket fund. **********Whether the quality of the companies coming public has deteriorated is a matter of opinion. A decade ago, only rarely could a company go public without a record of sales growth from three to five years and at least some profits. **********In 1997, though, about a third of the companies completing initial offerings were losing money, Ms. Killian said. Today, a similar portion have virtually no sales. **********''So if you are simplistic about it and look at traditional measures, you'd have to say that the quality has plunged,'' she said. ''But if you look at it in a different way, maybe not. Hindsight will be a great teacher.''"

But the deals did not satisfy the anti-smoking groups, which wanted stronger measures like Federal regulation of nicotine, and other lawsuits may continue to plague the industry. **********''The single biggest litigation threat has receded,'' said Martin Feldman, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ''But tobacco will remain a difficult social issue, and the residual litigation risk will be of concern to investors.'' **********Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, which advises institutional investors on tobacco litigation risks, said that state lawsuits were just part of a ''snowstorm'' of legal problems that have fallen on the industry in recent years. **********Still continuing are a Justice Department investigation into possible criminal wrongdoing by producers, individual cases brought by smokers and a class-action case, now under way in Miami, that was brought on behalf of all Florida smokers. **********There are also assaults from abroad. Nicaragua filed suit in Puerto Rico last month, seeking to recoup the cost of treating sick smokers, and Brazil has threatened to sue as well. Guatemala brought a similar action in Washington last spring. **********But such matters, both Ms. Aronson and Mr. Feldman agreed, pose a lesser threat than the state lawsuits did, and industry officials are turning their attention away from the courthouse and back to their businesses. **********''The settlement allows the companies to operate in an atmosphere of greater stability,'' Mr. Feldman said. **********The cigarette producers that participated in the plan are the Philip Morris Companies; R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation; Lorillard Tobacco, a unit of the Loews Corporation, and Brown & Williamson Tobacco, which is owned by B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. **********The nation's fifth-largest cigarette maker, Liggett & Myers, a subsidiary of the Brooke Group, also joined in, at the 11th hour, and U.S. Tobacco, which is owned by UST Inc., the nation's largest producer of smokeless tobacco, settled with all states except Massachusetts. **********Financially, the biggest test for the industry will be the effect of recent price increases on smoking rates. Soon after the signing of the settlement, both Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds increased prices 45 cents a pack at the wholesale level, passing along the settlement's cost to smokers. **********Some analysts are speculating that the price increase could reduce cigarette consumption by 6 percent to 8 percent. **********Others, like Mr. Feldman, say that while the price increase is not likely to make many smokers quit the habit, it may cause them to reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke each day. **********Michael E. Szymanczyk, the chief executive of Philip Morris U.S.A., said in a recent interview that he had little idea how the price increase would affect consumption. **********While analysts believe that Philip Morris will continue to consolidate its position as market leader, the biggest winner from the tobacco settlement may be Liggett & Myers. **********Unlike its larger competitors, Liggett, as part of a last-minute deal with attorneys general, was essentially given a free ride to participate in the $206 billion settlement plan. The company will not have to contribute to the settlement unless its future sales exceed 1997 levels by 125 percent. And that outcome is all but impossible because the company, just before signing the plan, sold three of its cigarette brands, representing some 14 percent of its sales, to Philip Morris. **********As a result, Liggett can raise its prices, too, without feeling any of the pain of having to give up any revenues to the states. **********Paul Klemperer, an economist at Oxford University, recently estimated that even if Liggett & Myers loses some sales when it raises its prices, it will still collect an additional $100 million a year, a sum equal to its recent market value. **********Investors apparently also see a boom for the company. In late November, when states approved the $206 billion pact, the stock of the Brooke Group, long an industry laggard, shot up nearly 60 percent in a single day's trading."

A vice president of the opposition Democratic Party, he has built his career on confrontations with the Belgrade authorities and the government of President Slobodan Milosevic. **********''The fight for democracy in Serbia is boring,'' he said, raising his glass at the news of another hitch with customs. ''But that's a good sign. I pray for five boring days in my life.'' **********As mayor of Nis, a depressed industrial city in southern Serbia, Mr. Zivkovic has little power but plenty of irritation. Belgrade has whittled away local government powers and retains control of the police and the courts, even of hospitals and schools. Mr. Zivkovic is left with not much more than utilities, transport and local media. **********Helped perhaps by two of the more independent-thinking local television stations in Serbia, he has won respect in his town as a doer who is not tainted by corruption. He is being talked of as a future leader of the Democratic Party, whose grass-roots support could renew Serbs' faith in politicians. **********Last week, he was constantly on the move, negotiating with the customs authorities daily on the border, driving to Belgrade for an opposition rally, and going back down to his hometown to get the heating plant director out of jail and to address some 4,000 supporters at one of the biggest opposition demonstrations in weeks. **********Mr. Zivkovic even persuaded members of the Serbian Renewal Movement, the largest opposition party, to join him on stage -- as they have refused to do with the other demonstrations against the government around Serbia. **********''He's good; he's a man with a future,'' said Slobodan Milutinovic, a trader in the crowd. ''He's doing his best.'' **********Even a member of the ruling Socialist Party, 60-year-old Vladimir Zaharjasevic, who was attending an exhibition on the NATO bombing campaign across town, had good words for Mr. Zivkovic. He blamed Mr. Milosevic's government rather than the mayor for the delays that ultimately forced the Europeans to abandon their attempt to deliver heating oil to Nis and a nearby city ruled by the opposition, Pirot. **********Mr. Zivkovic is one of two men in the Democratic Party, along with Slobodan Vuksanovic, a fellow vice president, who are being mentioned as possible successors to Zoran Djindjic, the party leader who has pledged to step down if he fails to force the government to call early elections. **********In a depressed opposition that seems almost constantly engaged in rancorous round-table discussions, Mr. Zivkovic stood out last week as a man of action. **********Before he joined the party in 1992, he ran an export-import business. He said the frustrations of dealing with the corrupt bureaucrats of Mr. Milosevic's government made him decide to join the opposition. **********''The Serbian government introduced import licenses, and the procedure involved 10 kilograms of different papers,'' he said in a recent interview. ''I was 32 years old, and I was not prepared to do that for another 40 years. **********''I became a member of the Democratic Party, knowing that I would not just be an ordinary member,'' he went on. In 1993 he won a seat in the Serbian Parliament; in 1994 he was voted one of three vice presidents of the party. In 1996, when an opposition coalition that later disintegrated won all major cities in local elections, he was elected mayor. **********During the NATO bombing of Serbia last spring, which hit Nis particularly hard, Mr. Zivkovic donned an army uniform and spoke out strongly against the bombing. ''All normal people are against the bombing,'' he said last week. **********Yet they are not anti-Western, he said, quoting a recent opinion poll in Nis showing that 60 percent of respondents wanted Serbia to join the European Union and 49 percent supported the idea of Serbia's joining the so-called Partnership for Peace, the waiting room for NATO membership. ''Three months after being bombed by NATO, people are for NATO,'' Mr. Zivkovic said. **********At the rally last week, there was no doubt of his supporters' feelings. He raised the biggest cheer when he spoke of Serbia's place in Europe. Alluding to the recent friendship that Mr. Milosevic and his wife have promoted with the Communist rulers of China and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, he added: ''We want average people to travel, go about, do the usual things. We never lived like people in China or Iraq; we used to live like people in Belgium.''"

Gen. Walter Jertz, said on Wednesday that allied military intelligence had concluded that the reason Serbian forces were shelling Albanian positions along and across the border was to get into a position to withdraw without being harried by their enemies as they leave. **********''Artillery fire is often used by ground troops to assist in breaking contact with closing enemy forces,'' General Jertz said, also citing reports of looting by Serbian soldiers in Pristina, the provincial capital, and elsewhere in central Kosovo as signs that they were preparing to leave. **********Serbian tanks and artillery that had been seen moving from the center of the province to reinforce the troops on the Albanian border, General Jertz said, were also apparently going to be used to protect the Serbian forces as they withdrew. **********''We will not attack military forces withdrawing,'' he said. **********On Wednesday, Gen. Hans-Peter von Kirchbach, Chief of Staff of the German Army, said: ''Since this morning, the air strikes have all but stopped.'' **********But General Jertz said later that air operations continued throughout the day. Still, he and other officials here did not dispute that, but for the shouting, the fight was over. **********Some 17,500 French, British and German troops are already assembled in Macedonia for the 50,000-strong peacekeeping force, and more are on the way. The United States is expected to provide 7,000 troops, about as many as France, while Britain will contribute at least 13,000 and Germany will send 8,500. **********Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, kept tight control over the bombing campaign in the last few days, ratcheting the number of missions up and down to keep pressure on the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, to live up to the pledge he first made last Thursday in Belgrade to pull his troops out of Kosovo. **********Allied planes flew 523 missions between Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning, 135 fewer than in the previous 24-hour period, the command said. Most focused on Serbian army forces battling the Kosovo Liberation Army near the Albanian border. Bombs and missiles struck eight artillery pieces, two armored personnel carriers, eight tanks, and fortified positions and military vehicles and other targets in two places in southern Serbia. **********Jamie P. Shea, the NATO spokesman, said that B-52 bombers and other attacking planes had inflicted heavy losses on Serbian forces in Kosovo in the past week alone, hitting 29 tanks, 93 armored personnel carriers, 209 artillery pieces, 11 antiaircraft radars, and other equipment in the seven days since Mr. Milosevic first agreed to pull out of Kosovo. **********''These are the sort of losses no army can suffer for long and remain operational,'' Mr. Shea said. **********Allied commanders believe a B-52 strike Sunday on Serbian troops concentrated near the Albanian border may have killed and wounded several hundred of them. **********''We have obviously also witnessed the loss of many Yugoslav soldiers, we don't know how many,'' Mr. Shea said. ''But they did not need to either be killed or be injured. **********''It is not NATO which is prolonging the air operations beyond the point at which we would have liked to have suspended them,'' he said. ''It is Milosevic.'' **********In all, the allies claim to have killed or wounded thousands of Yugoslav soldiers, police and paramilitaries, and destroyed or damaged 150 tanks, 300 armored personnel carriers, and 325 artillery pieces since the bombing began on March 24. **********The air campaign destroyed scores of highway and rail bridges and all of the country's oil refining capacity, and more than 100 aircraft, including all but two of Yugoslavia's most advanced Mig-29 fighters, the allies say, leaving Yugoslavia's airfields in ruins, its vaunted weapons factories wrecked, and its national communications system disrupted. **********The high-tech campaign cost the allies only two deaths, they say, both from the crash of an American antitank helicopter in a training accident in Albania last month. **********General Jertz said that Serbian antiaircraft fire had brought down an unpiloted allied surveillance aircraft on Tuesday. Several low-flying drones have been downed by Serbian antiaircraft fire, which keeps allied planes flying higher than 15,000 feet much of the time."

Theoretically, the House of Representatives could overrule executive branch decisions on classification, but that would be unusual. **********Some, but not all, of the committee's findings have appeared in news accounts in the last several weeks, prompting new inquiries by the House and Senate into how the Clinton Administration and the White House have handled the issue. The allegations also figured in the just-completed visit to the United States by the Chinese Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, who denounced them as untrue. **********Mr. Cox suggested today that his committee's findings about Chinese espionage went beyond what has appeared in news accounts. **********''In addition to what's been in the newspaper, the pattern is broader still,'' he said. ''And in fact, the pattern extends back several decades and continues almost certainly to this very day.'' **********The committee's ranking Democrat, Norm Dicks of Washington, appearing on the same television program as Mr. Cox, said he talked on Saturday night to Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, about getting the report out ''as quickly as possible.'' **********Mr. Dicks attributed the delay in declassification to the need to protect human intelligence sources in China."

https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/business/investing-munis-gaining-luster-as-yield-gap-narrows.html,Joanne Legomsky,1999-09-05,Article on factors at play that are making high-quality municipal bonds look more attractive relative to Treasury bonds; graph (M),624,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Munis Gaining Luster As Yield Gap Narrows,INVESTING; Munis Gaining Luster As Yield Gap Narrows," **********LESS than two weeks after the Federal Reserve raised its Federal funds target rate by a quarter percentage point, high-quality municipal bonds are still looking extraordinarily attractive relative to plain-vanilla Treasury bonds, experts say. **********Last Tuesday, for example, New York's Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority priced $225 million of highly rated, general purpose revenue bonds due in 2030 to yield 5.74 percent, or 94 percent of the 6.08 percent yield on a 30-year Treasury bond. So an investor would give up only a smidgen of yield in return for munis' freedom from taxation. And while that 94 percent figure is less than the 100 percent ratio that munis hit briefly last fall, it is still far above the 85 percent that they have averaged since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. **********''It's absurd,'' said David Kotok, president of Cumberland Advisors, a muni bond manager in Vineland, N.J. ''Tax-free yields are nearly equal to those on taxable instruments.'' He noted that for a taxpayer with a combined state and Federal tax rate of 45 percent, a muni with a 5.8 percent coupon has a tax-equivalent yield of 10.5 percent. **********A couple of factors are at play here. The amount of Treasury bonds outstanding has been tapering off and is expected to shrink by $100 billion this year, making them relatively more expensive, compared with most other kinds of debt, according to R. B. Davidson 3d, director of municipal investments at Sanford C. Bernstein. A result, he said, is that ''individuals in high tax brackets should move out of Treasuries and into high-grade munis.'' **********Moreover, the robust United States economy has vastly improved the credit quality of most municipal bond jurisdictions, so default risk for high-quality munis is virtually zero, analysts say. **********But because of rising supply, the increased credit quality has not come at the expense of higher muni prices. Taking advantage of interest-rate cuts last year, muni bond issuance rose sharply as governments sought to cut borrowing costs. **********Demand for munis by institutions, meanwhile, has all but evaporated. ''No money has gone into muni bond funds since April,'' said George Friedlander, fixed-income strategist with Salomon Smith Barney. **********The biggest factor weighing down muni prices, however, is the protracted, take-no-prisoners bull market in stocks, said Christopher Dillon,  a strategist with J. P. Morgan Securities. Against annual double-digit gains in the stock market, 6 percent yields on munis look puny. **********Still, because muni bonds are not subject to the ebb and flow of foreign demand, they have been far more stable investments than Treasuries, said Steven Harrop, a manager with Strong Capital Management. Mr. Kotok added that investors in an index of muni bonds -- say, the Bond Buyer 40 -- at about this time last year would have ridden out the turmoil in global financial markets without experiencing much volatility. He calculated that over the last 115 weeks, 10-year Treasuries were three times as volatile as munis, as measured by their standard deviation. **********Those interested only in income might do best to buy individual bonds and hold them to maturity, instead of buying muni bond funds. The strategy allows investors to tailor bond cash flows and maturations to their particular needs. **********But if you think muni prices will rise and you want to take advantage of the gain, a fund or managed account might make sense. Mr. Kotok said current prices offered the chance for capital gains of 15 percent or more if, as he expects, muni prices rise enough to push their yields down to 85 percent of that of Treasuries. **********Michael Shamosh, fixed-income strategist at Tucker Anthony Inc., said that with rates at their current levels, buying munis yourself makes more sense. ''In a 5 percent rate environment, management fees may outweigh the advantages of management expertise, purchasing efficiency and diversification,'' he said."

But in a morning news conference Defense Minister Nikola Kljusev hinted that his Government might decide to allow into Macedonia each day only as many refugees as are flown or bused out of the country by aid groups. **********[''There can be a balance established between a number who are evacuated and the number of refugees who are allowed into our country,'' Mr. Kljusev said, Reuters reported.] **********Aid workers called the border closing and the Defense Minister's comment the latest examples of the Macedonian Government's using the lives of Kosovar refugees to effectively blackmail aid agencies and Western governments. **********While the influx of over 200,000 refugees is putting the small country under tremendous social, political and economic pressure, they said, the Government's tactics are inappropriate. **********''We are sympathetic to their position,'' said one aid worker who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''But nevertheless you don't close the border to people who have been terrorized and send them back into the arms of the people who have been carrying out these crimes.'' **********Protests aside, the tactic is working. As the overcrowding in refugee camps worsens, in part because of  Macedonia's refusal to expand them, Western nations are stepping up slow-moving efforts to evacuate refugees. And Macedonian and Albanian government officials are completing an agreement that will allow an initial group of 6,000 refugees to be transported from Macedonia to Albania by bus. **********The evacuations, particularly the shifting of refugees to Albania, is a victory for the Macedonian Government. Albania, a far poorer country, has already accepted twice as many refugees as Macedonia. But aid officials said American, British and other Western diplomats are so fearful of upsetting Macedonia's fragile ethnic balance that they are acquiescing to the Macedonian tactics. **********What diplomats fear is an explosion of ethnic tensions in Macedonia, where ethnic Macedonians make up two-thirds of the population and ethnic Albanians make up most of the rest. Ethnic Macedonians fear they could be outnumbered by ethnic Albanians if refugees from Kosovo are allowed to continue to flood over the border and resettle here as refugees have in past Balkan wars. **********Macedonia's fragile coalition Government, consisting of the country's two main ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian parties, could collapse, and fighting in Macedonia could draw Albania and Greece into a wider Balkan war. **********Macedonian Government officials have said the refugees, who now represent nearly 10 percent of the country's population of two million, are creating enormous economic and social costs. With commerce with Yugoslavia, its main trading partner,  nonexistent, Macedonia's economy is suffering, Government officials complain, and Western nations have been slow to deliver aid. On Wednesday, industrialized nations and aid groups promised Macedonia at least $250 million in assistance. **********Why the Macedonian soldiers herded the refugees back into Kosovo at the border crossing at Blace on Wednesday night is not clear, according to officials from the High Commissioner for Refugees. **********Ron Redmond, an agency spokesman, said refugees officials saw a group of soldiers arrive at the border on Wednesday at roughly 5:30 P.M. **********Standing shoulder to shoulder, they advanced in a long line toward roughly 1,000 refugees waiting in a no man's land between the Yugoslav and Macedonian border posts. Moving slowly, they pushed the bewildered refugees back toward the Yugoslav border post. **********Once there, Yugoslav border guards, acting far more roughly than the Macedonians, drove the crowd back, beating some refugees. The group was finally herded around a corner where they could not be seen, Mr. Redmond said. This morning, a single family that managed to cross reported that 2,000 to 4,000 were waiting to cross just out of sight of the border. **********''There are also reports that another train arrived,'' Mr. Redmond said. ''It went back to Pristina fully loaded.'' Pristina is the capital of Kosovo. **********Refugee officials today met with various Macedonian Government ministers, all of whom denied the border was closed.

Investors sold 10-year bonds, sending their price tumbling, and their yield, which moves in the opposite direction, higher. **********The ripple effects of the central bank's move extended to the United States, where long-term Treasury bond prices tumbled and pushed yields to the highest level since August. The bond selloff spread to stocks, which lost most of their gains from Thursday. **********The Bank of Japan's move will bring down to 0.15 percent the rate charged to banks on overnight loans. But the central bank also said it would supply an abundance of funds to expand the money supply. This in theory could mean that the overnight rate could fall effectively to zero. **********The move was seen as little more than a modest attempt to allay widespread fears that long-term interest rates, which have tripled in the last few months to 2.4 percent and driven up the yen's value, could  squelch Japan's recovery from the worst recession since the end of World War II. **********Although still low by world standards, Japan's rising long-term interest rates are harmful to its economy because they raise borrowing costs and discourage consumers from spending. The rising yen is harmful because it hurts Japanese exports. **********''It's a very weak move,'' said Xinyi Lu, a fixed-income strategist at Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. in Tokyo, referring to the Bank of Japan's announcement today. ''The BOJ tried hard to show people it is paying attention to the market and that it is listening to the politicians a little bit. But it's losing face.'' **********Government officials have been saying that the economy will pick up in the summer. Yet, economists and policy makers from around the world have been calling on Japanese policy makers to take increasingly drastic measures to pull Japan out of a deflationary spiral. They have urged Japan to pour more money into the financial system and to calm the recent turmoil in the bond markets, one of the world's largest. **********Today's move by the Bank of Japan will probably not cure any of these ills in the long term, financial experts say. **********The market jitteriness has increased anxiety among Japan's Members of Parliament, who have jumped into a debate over what the Bank of Japan should do with monetary policy. Even Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who has essentially promised to deliver an economic recovery to the nation this year, is expressing concerns. **********Japan's looming budget deficit, its swelling Government debt and the giant spending packages the Government is carrying out to stimulate the economy have cast a dark shadow over the markets, leading investors to dump bonds in recent weeks, a main reason why the yields have risen so much. **********This year, Japan is set to be the world's largest issuer of national bonds, issuing nine of every 10 bonds, according to J. P. Morgan. In contrast, the United States is enjoying a budget surplus and is shaving the volume of Treasury bonds it plans to issue. **********The volume of bonds Tokyo will have to issue domestically is startling and has Japanese bond investors worried that there will not be enough buyers for those bonds.  Throughout the world, Japan is typically thought of as a source, rather than an absorber, of capital. **********Many market strategists have said the Government should promise to buy some of those bonds to reduce the supply, which would raise bond prices, lower yields and lead to falling interest rates and a cheaper yen. But the Bank of Japan's move today indicated that the Government had no such intentions. **********Some politicians have begun to call for more extreme measures, demanding that the Bank of Japan effectively print money by buying national bonds outright. But the central bank has ruled out such a strategy because it would cause inflation. **********The direct impact of today's rate reduction may save only about $250 million to $350 million in lower interest costs in the overnight market over the course of a year. The Bank of Japan, however, seems to be aiming for a broader spillover effect that is probably more psychological than direct. **********So Japan finds itself in a quandary. Short-term interest rates are already so low that further lowering them is likely to have minimal effect, and yet policy makers still need to ease monetary policy to stimulate the economy. **********''This is a test case for the world,'' said Mr. Lu at Paribas Capital Markets. ''We have never seen so many different measures come together in an advanced country -- and not work.'' **********In September, the Bank of Japan lowered the overnight rate to 0.25 percent, from 0.50 percent. In November, it stepped up open market operations, a means of adding money to the market, and then set up a mechanism to encourage banks to lend more to corporations on an emergency basis. Today, it said it would cut that rate in half, to 0.25 percent, mainly to complement the reduction in the overnight rate."

''We Taiwanese go crazy for just about anything that's Japanese.'' **********Around the corner from Tower Records, young Taiwanese women gathered in Hsih Men Ting's main square to show off their brown-dyed hair, salon-tanned skin, platform shoes and glittery teardrop stickers, long the fashion rage in Japan. **********The young women, who looked as if they just stepped off a Japanese tour bus, talked of rushing home to see their favorite soap opera, ''Great Teacher Onizuka,'' a Japanese drama starring the handsome actor Takashi Sorimachi. **********''We like Japanese things because Japan is a very advanced country with a very sophisticated lifestyle,'' said Vicky Chen, 18, a high school student. ''I dream of visiting there one day.'' **********Her classmate, Kelly Chou, concurred: ''Taiwan is too conservative, but Japanese fashion and music are so daring, so cutting edge. I love them.'' **********The Taiwanese are not the only devoted fans of things Japanese, which have become immensely popular across East Asia, especially among young people who adore Japanese music, movies, television, animation, fashion and food. The current craze for Japanese popular culture products among young Asians is unprecedented in its scope and size. **********In South Korea, for example, Japanese culture cafes and teahouses are quickly replacing American fast-food restaurants and European-style coffee houses as the preferred meeting places for college students. Japanese rock and jazz bands are more popular than their Korean counterparts, and many soap operas, game shows and television dramas are direct copies of Japanese programs. **********In Hong Kong, newsstands cannot stock enough copies of Japanese comic books and fashion magazines.  Japanese television dramas have huge followings. **********In China, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, bootleg copies of Japanese music, movies and merchandise like Hello Kitty dolls are popular. **********The number of Asians studying Japanese has increased 29 percent in the past five years, according to the Japan Foundation. The foundation, a government agency that promotes cultural exchanges, attributes much of the growth to young people who are interested in Japanese popular culture or joining a Japanese firm. **********''I don't think we can ever underestimate the power of Japanese culture, which now ranks second in terms of global market share'' behind the United States, said Kang Hun, a leading Korean cultural critic who teaches a course in popular culture at Hong-Ik University in Seoul. **********''Culture is like water,'' he said. ''It flows from stronger nations to weaker ones. People tend to idolize countries that are wealthier, freer, and more advanced, and in Asia that country is Japan.'' **********Other factors contributing to the popularity of Japanese culture include Japan's proximity, the availability of Japanese programs on cable and satellite television and aggressive marketing and packaging. **********''Geographically and culturally, we are closer to Japan than to the United States and Europe, so it's natural that Japanese products would be a hit here in Hong Kong,'' said Lisa Leung, who teaches cross-cultural studies at Hong Kong's Lingnan University. ''Just look at Japanese fashion: it fits us better than American and European styles.'' **********But Mr. Kang said that perhaps the main reason Japanese cultural products are so popular in Asia is that they borrow heavily from Western culture, particularly in their reliance on sex and violence. **********''Much of Japanese popular culture is Western culture with an Asian face,'' Mr. Kang said. ''So Koreans and Chinese who are familiar with Western culture feel a unique Asian trait in Japanese culture that is very appealing.'' **********Winnie Lan, research director for Ogilvy & Mather Company in Taiwan, said that Japanese cultural products are popular because they are generally of high quality, and well marketed. **********''The Japanese make all their products look good at least on the outside,'' Ms. Lan said. ''That's why almost all the Japanese artists we know are packaged as idols.'' **********The keen interest in Japanese culture among young Asians is a major departure from the decades of disdain that their elders who lived under the iron hand of Japanese colonization have had for things Japanese. **********Many older Asians have told their children and grandchildren of the sufferings they endured under the Japanese and warned them of the ''evils'' of Japanese culture. South Korea, reacting to Japan's brutal colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, long restricted both the import of Japanese cultural products and the performance and display of Japanese art forms. **********Today, South Korea allows the staging of Japanese dance, classical music and theater performances without restrictions. New rules announced in September permit performances by Japanese entertainers in medium-size sites and screenings of Japanese G-rated movies that have received international honors. **********Indeed, long before the government began lifting the restrictions, Japanese cultural products were being integrated formally and informally into Korean society. ''The government saw the handwriting on the wall,'' Mr. Kang said. **********At Kakehashi, a Japanese cafe in Seoul, college students gather to practice Japanese, read Japanese fashion magazines and watch videos by their favorite Japanese bands like Kinki Kids and Malice Mizer. **********Takizawa Ushio, 25, a Japanese graduate student who teaches Japanese literature in Seoul, said that given the history of bad blood between Korea and Japan, he was concerned that he would not be welcomed in South Korea. **********''I was afraid that the Koreans wouldn't like me, and there are some who don't,'' he said. ''But I have been surprised that so many Japanese things are popular here and that there are many Koreans who want to know me just because I am Japanese.'' **********Still, some Koreans feel that their government has moved too quickly, and fear that some aspects of Japanese popular culture, like its liberal depiction of violence and sex and strong emphasis on commercialism, might negatively effect Korea. **********The Seoul Y.M.C.A. has established a media monitoring group that  scrutinizes imported Japanese programs and Korean programs based on Japanese genres. **********If the Y.M.C.A. determines that a program violates Korean norms and ethics, the group lobbies government censors to have it restricted. **********''Opening Korea to Japanese culture may be correct logically, but from a historical and political point of view it couldn't be more wrong,'' said Lee Seung Jung, the executive director of the Seoul Y.M.C.A. ''Because of Japan's occupation, many Koreans cannot tell which part of their culture is ours and which part came from Japan. There are too many issues that have not yet been resolved.'' **********Nowhere outside Japan does its culture appear more cherished than in Taiwan, which was a Japanese colony for 50 years. Unlike in Korea and China, however, Japan's rule of Taiwan was fairly harmonious. **********''Most of the infrastructure in Taiwan was established by the Japanese during the 50-year-rule, and that infrastructure later became the cornerstone of the government's extraordinary economic achievement,'' said Liao Hsianghsiong, deputy director of the governing Nationalist Party's department of cultural affairs. ''Generally speaking, the Taiwanese don't hate Japan.'' **********Back at Hsih Men Ting, a group of young Taiwanese men, sporting the latest androgynous look that is the mode in Japan, checked out the young women in the square. With brown-toned hair and arched eyebrows and dressed entirely in form-fitting black, Chung Shuan-lin was ready to make his move. **********''Our look is cool,'' he said. ''It's Japanese. It's what all the girls like.''"

Pezzano, a marketing consultant who helped what once was an obscure Canadian board game, Trivial Pursuit, achieve sales totaling more than $1 billion, died Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 54. **********She died of cervical cancer, said her brother David. **********The Trivial Pursuit campaign designed by Ms. Pezzano changed the way game makers do business. Dorothy Crenshaw, who worked with Ms. Pezzano in marketing games and other products, said the approach was based on drumming up favorable word-of-mouth comments, or buzz. **********For Trivial Pursuit, Ms. Pezzano sent 1,800 top buyers who would be attending the 1983 New York Toy Fair a series of teasing messages in the months before the event. She also sent the game to Hollywood stars whose names were mentioned in its trivia questions. When some stars, including Gregory Peck, James Mason, Pat Boone and Larry Hagman, wrote letters of thanks, she used them in her promotions. **********She also staged game-playing events at parks, bars, restaurants and ski clubs to stimulate conversation. **********One virtue of her campaign was that it was cheap. By giving away a few hundred games at a wholesale cost of $12 each, a fad was started. **********''She knew nobody would play a board game without getting their hands on it,'' said Chris Byrne, who in 1985 worked with Ms. Pezzano in selling the game Pictionary, a way of playing charades on paper. ''She took games to the people,'' said Mr. Byrne, who is now editor of Toy Report, an industry publication. **********Mr. Byrne said her direct approach to potential players contrasted sharply with what was then the standard -- and expensive -- practice: relying on television, movies and licensing agreements. **********''She created the model that everyone now uses,'' he said. ''Today we call it 'viral marketing.' '' **********Giving games away was a major part of the strategy, and she and Mr. Byrne would sometimes pass out free Pictionary games to every passenger on a flight they were on. ''We estimated that for every complete Pictionary we gave away, we sold between 5 and 12 more,'' he said. **********Ms. Pezzano was born and raised in Schenectady. She came to Manhattan at 17 to become a folk singer. She attended Elmira College without obtaining an undergraduate degree but later earned a master's degree from Columbia Business School while working full time. **********Besides her brother David of Schenectady, she is survived by another brother, Michael of Portland, Ore. **********After a short stint with a public relations firm in the early 1980's she founded her own company, which took on Trivial Pursuit as one of its first projects. After her company was acquired by Dorf & Stanton in 1986, she moved to Italy, where she advised businesses on international ventures. In 1995, she returned to New York and started a new company, Pezzano Inc. **********She continued to work on games, including a new sports trivia game called Rules of the Game. Among her ideas was to sell it in sporting goods stores rather than toy stores, where board games are traditionally sold. **********''You could go to Harvard Business School and learn how to do that,'' Mr. Byrne said, ''but to Linda it was always just common sense, and fun.''"

As is so often the mission of art, it pursues an ideal rather than reality. In it, the Central Bank, a plump study in pink, smiles gravely down on a promenade of tall palms lapped by blue waves. **********Upstairs, where Mr. Ribeira's earlier watercolors hang, the true Luanda lifts its skirts over the mud to reveal scabied ankles. In his portraits of elegant old manses, plaster flakes off faded walls, and pools of stagnant water intrude at the edges. **********These paintings do not tell half the story. Impoverished Luanda has many horrifying scenes: the skinny street children who live in the sewers and emerge through stinking drains at dawn; the hundreds of young men who live in the city dump and pound on arriving trucks with steel hooks, impatient for the disgorging of the trash so they can claw through it for aluminum or for food that is only half-rotten. **********But lately the reality has veered a bit toward Mr. Ribeiro's ideal. Luanda is a pit, but a pit with a touch of the phoenix. Since 1994 it has actually defied the downward spiral of many African cities and perked up a bit. **********Now, sadly, with the return of war this year and the unraveling of the peace accord, all that is threatened. **********Independence Square, for example, used to have as its central monument a Soviet tank crushing a South African one, a memorial to the 1980's wars that pitted the Government's Cuban allies against the rebels' South African ones. Five years ago the tanks were removed as part of efforts to demilitarize the city. **********The stone pedestal sat in the middle of a dustbowl. Recently the provincial Governor's campaign to beautify Luanda reached the square and turned it into a greensward with sunflowers and lilies, a startling oasis in a sere, potholed, shot-up city. **********Even Mr. Ribeiro's mural feels prophetic. The Central Bank is now spotless pink, as is the refurbished Presidential Palace up the hill. The esplanade was repaved last year. Empty sidewalk holes got new palm saplings. **********The nearby Palacio de Dona Joaquina -- from whose porch Lady Joaquina sold slaves and, according to legend, defied Portugal's ban on the trade by building a secret tunnel to the wharf -- has been wrested away from the squatters who vandalized it. **********And going well beyond the cosmetic, Luanda has signed a $700,000-a-month contract with a private company, Urbana 2000, to take over its garbage collection and street-sweeping and the maintenance of its fetid, decrepit sewers. **********Urbana collects 1,100 tons of trash a day and has drained so many of the scummy pools in the slums that the city's malaria rate is going down, its director general, Victor Diogo, said. **********On a company video he showed, delighted local administrators watch its bulldozers ram the mountains of steaming, fermenting garbage that accrete behind the city's open-air markets. **********''Some of this trash has lain here for 15 years,'' said Domingos Victor, mayor of the Maianga district. ''Things are getting better.'' **********But there is still a long way to go. Even when the company's trucks suck up knee-deep ponds of sewage, the best they can do is pump it into a pipe that carries it less than a mile out to sea. **********The renewal of war has thrown cleanup efforts into doubt. Angola has great oil wealth, which helped it buy Urbana's 200 new trucks and dozers. But corruption siphons off much of the money, and an expanding military budget will suck up what is left. **********Also, Luanda is a city of war refugees. Vast tracts that were desert 15 years ago are now filled with shacks that have no power or toilets and get their water from trucks. By some estimates, half of the country's 11 million people will soon live here, and services will be even more overwhelmed. **********''If war really stops in Angola, the country will be back on the rails in 10 or 12 years,'' said Mr. Diogo. **********If not, said Bonifacer Cassoma, the foreman at the city dump, pointing to mud-brick houses rising nearby in a field that was empty only six months ago, ''there will be millions of people here soon, relocating from the countryside.'' **********''And that's more problems for us,'' he added. **********One refugee from the war seems to be Osvaldo Mingo, 13, who lives in a Luanda sewer. **********Osvaldo's father was a soldier killed in the city of Huambo, he says, although a child care worker warns that some Luanda street children lie about their pasts. If they have fled abusive homes they get no sympathy, while war orphans do. **********Osvaldo sleeps on a ledge beneath a sidewalk with nine friends and their dog. **********Startled drivers swerve when the boys pull themselves out of the storm gutter at dawn, their heads popping out of the street, to start another day of washing parked cars, checking dumpsters for food and begging. **********By the end of the day, they hope to have enough cash for a pack of cigarettes and some gasoline to sniff -- or, if they are lucky, something less nauseating. **********Osvaldo chose the reeking sewer for safety, he said. At a camp site up the street, bigger children beat smaller ones for their car-washing earnings. Only very young or thin children can slip into his home -- the drain holes in the gutter are less than a foot wide. **********''When it rains, the sewer floods,'' he said. ''We take our cardboard and sleep under the buildings there.'' **********He arrived here on a Red Cross helicopter flight from the war zone, he said, but does not remember when. He ran away from the airport and lived on a traffic circle for a while. **********His last home was a Government center. ''They gave us tunics to go to school in,'' he said. ''I was eating cashew nuts, and I messed mine up, and they took it away. So I ran off.'' **********The boys scoop brown water out of the sidewalk that seems to seep up from a broken pipe. **********''Oh, yes, it's good to drink, it's good for cooking,'' Docas Adao assured a horrified visitor. Like Osvaldo, he looks 10 but says he is 13. **********If they get sick they go to the Red Cross. Two of their group have died, one hit by a car as he was emerging from the gutter, another bitten by a rabid dog. **********Bento Manuel Lino, a security guard at the apartment building above the sewer, has some sympathy for the boys. He has stopped bullies from beating them, he said. ''They steal from us sometimes, but it's because they have nothing and they're hungry,'' he said, shrugging. **********Mimosa Darseu, 10, who lives in a house around the corner, says he is not afraid of the boys, ''but if you have good clothes on, they may try to take them.'' **********Even in Angola, there are Government homes for street children, said Ricardo Jose Bernardo, 26, who runs a children's project for the charity Action for Life. ''But we interview them, and we only take the ones who want go,'' he said. ''Kids like their liberty.''"

The French telephone company said it planned to compete against Deutsche Telekom in fixed-line services and Internet access as well. **********Indeed, the deal announced today sets the stage for a confrontation across Europe. Since July, the French and German companies have both made big acquisitions in Britain and have vowed to build pan-European networks. **********''We don't consider that we are intimately hostile toward each other,'' said Eric Bouvier, a senior vice president at France Telecom.  ''We're just competitors, but we're the two largest competitors in the European market.'' **********Today's announcement was a coup for France Telecom, which has been looking at ways to attack the German market ever since its alliance with Deutsche Telekom essentially collapsed this summer. **********Until recently, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had scrupulously avoided attacking each other's markets and were partners in Global One, a joint venture with the Sprint Corporation that provided services to corporate customers. **********But that partnership abruptly went cold when Deutsche Telekom infuriated the French by trying to acquire Telecom Italia. **********The last remnant of the partnership unraveled earlier this month, when MCI Worldcom reached a deal to acquire Sprint for $108 billion. **********Worldcom will be buying out the stakes that both France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had in Sprint, and withdrawing from Global One. **********Under the deal announced today, France Telecom will acquire 60 percent of the E-Plus wireless telephone network from two major German utility companies, Veba and RWE. **********The former French monopoly had already signaled its intentions several weeks ago when it agreed to pay $1.86 billion for a 17 percent stake in E-Plus sold by Vodafone Airtouch. **********The agreement to acquire a controlling stake was largely a result of lucky timing. Veba wanted to sell its stake in E-Plus, because it planned to merge with another utility, Viag, which controls Germany's fourth and smallest mobile network. **********RWE, based in Essen, wanted to sell its stake as part of a broader plan to finance big acquisitions in its core business, electricity generation. **********Both the French and German telephone companies have been looking for deals on the Continent. Though Deutsche Telekom's bid for Telecom Italia failed, the German company won an auction in August to acquire the British wireless carrier, One-2-One, for $11 billion. **********By some measures, the French got more for their money with E-Plus in Germany than the Germans got in Britain. Douglas Wight, an industry analyst for Commerzbank in London, said the French price worked out to about $200 for each potential customer while the German price worked out to about $230. **********By contrast, Deutsche Telekom has no real presence in France, Europe's second-biggest market after Germany. It is also out of the Italian market. **********France Telecom, meanwhile, has built up a significant presence outside of France and Germany. In the Netherlands, it owns a controlling stake in the Dutchtone mobile telephone service as well as all of a Dutch cable operator called Casema. It is also the controlling shareholder of a telephone company in Spain, a mobile telephone service in Belgium and has an assortment of other holdings in central Europe."

Rather, the executives said, the report's conclusions stemmed from enforcement actions at a minority of the industry's branch offices. **********Day trading drew widespread national attention last month when Mark O. Barton shot and killed nine people at the Atlanta offices of two day-trading firms where he had lost an estimated half a million dollars trading stocks. The state regulators' report, which had been in the works for months before the Atlanta shootings, cited questionable practices at the Massachusetts office of one of those firms, All-Tech Investment Group, which in December was barred from business in the state for two years. The other firm that was a site in the shooting spree by Mr. Barton, Momentum Securities, was not cited for questionable practices, but it is one of the nation's largest day-trading firms, according to the report. **********Day trading is generally defined as a strategy in which individuals make scores of stock trades each day trying to exploit small movements in share prices. In contrast to most forms of investing, day traders hold no securities overnight or for longer terms. **********That form of rapid in-and-out trading can produce returns of up to 12 percent a day for retirees, laid-off executives, college students and others, according to the promotional materials of some day-trading firms. But in fact, the regulatory group said, most day traders lose most if not all of their money within the first few months. **********In a bull market where everyone seems to be making money, ''I think there is a sentiment among some investors that they have missed out or fallen behind, and that day trading might be an opportunity to catch up,'' said William F. Galvin, secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, whose office oversees the state's securities regulators. Cheap computers also have allowed individuals to gain access to market data once limited to professional investors. **********To keep unsuccessful traders from giving up, day-trading firms promote and arrange loans from one customer to another, allowing some traders to cover losses and to continue speculating, the group said. In one case, a branch manager forged customer signatures on loan documents, the regulators said, and was said to have had an agreement to split profits with the customers as part of the deal. **********Any time they broker a deal between a lender and a customer, these firms are violating the spirit of rules that prevent brokerage firms from direct lending, regulators say. Those  rules are designed to keep individuals from losing money they do not have, the regulators said. **********Mr. Galvin said day-trading firms that promote lending between customers do so ''using the same rhetoric as bunko artists and Ponzi schemes.'' **********Day trading is certainly a risky investment practice, but the report on day trading has several shortcomings that suggest it may be more of a snapshot than a comprehensive look at the industry. **********Despite being seven months in the making, the report did not independently quantify how many Americans were practicing day trading or attempt to determine how much activity they account for in the stock market. **********One of the regulatory group's most intriguing findings was that only 11.5 percent of traders at a single firm in Massachusetts demonstrated the ability to conduct profitable short-term trading, while 70 percent lost money. But those results came from an All-Tech day-trading office that was shut down by Massachusetts authorities last year for violating securities laws, suggesting the firm's customers and their experience may not be typical. The study examined 30 trading accounts at the Massachusetts branch, 17 of which were deemed to contain true day-trading activity. **********Linda Lerner, general counsel of All-Tech Investment Group, said: ''The Massachusetts office was a bad office being run by a bad manager. It is not typical.'' **********Some other findings were based on examinations of 35 day-trading offices or firms by regulators in four states: Colorado, Texas, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Those examinations have resulted in 13 enforcement orders, and 10 additional investigations are pending, said David Shellenberger, chief of licensing at the Massachusetts Securities Division and chairman of the day-trading task force that prepared the report. **********That sample represents a small portion of the day-trading industry, which the task force said encompassed at least 287 branch offices serving 62 firms. In March, the Electronic Traders Association, a trade group headed by James H. Lee, president of Momentum Securities, said that 4,000 to 5,000 individuals were active day traders, but estimates vary greatly and it is hard to say how many people are active at one time and how many people may have multiple accounts. **********Mr. Shellenberger said the state group's report was intended ''to relate the collective experience'' of regulators in their interactions with day-trading firms. ''I think the problems we found are pervasive in the industry,'' he said. **********Industry officials denounced the report. ''It's such a piece of trash it's pathetic,'' Ms. Lerner of All-Tech Investment Group said. To determine profit potential, regulators examined 30 accounts of the firm's defunct Massachusetts office. ''We have more than 2,000 accounts, so it's hardly a representative sample,'' Ms. Lerner said. **********The Electronic Traders Association said in a statement that it supported increased disclosure by day-trading firms; in addition, it issued a statement of ethical principles for its member firms. But it added that the use of inter-customer loans is longstanding in the securities industry. **********Securities firms are required to recommend only investments that are appropriate for a customer, but there is currently no explicit requirement for day-trading firms to advise potential customers about specific risks. The National Association of Securities Dealers, however, approved new suitability and disclosure rules for day trading in July and is expected to send the proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission for final approval soon. **********Today, a spokesman for the S.E.C. said the agency commended the state regulators' study, adding that day- trading firms had an obligation to disclose risks to customers. The commission is currently conducting compliance examinations of day- trading firms. **********The regulators cited several examples of what they called misleading marketing. In the case of All-Tech, Massachusetts regulators found that the firm's branch office manual provided ''guidance to branch managers in overcoming the objections of prospective customers,'' including being intentionally vague in discussing ''success ratios,'' or what portion of customers traded profitably. **********Another firm, On-Line Investment Services, claimed on its Web site ''a success rate of around 85 percent,'' but when asked by the state securities division for proof of the claim, the firm deleted the information and denied the claim. **********And the TCI Corporation, a day-trading firm not related to the better-known cable television company, said on its Web site that customers earned 12 percent a day before commission. But when questioned by regulators, the firm admitted that the figure was based on buy and sell signals posted the week after market activity -- a practice Massachusetts securities officials deemed ''analogous to predicting the prior week's weather.'' **********The state regulators said they also intended to examine more closely  loans made between day-trading customers and whether customers are being fairly advised of their best interests. At one firm, Landmark Securities, transfers between customer accounts totaled $2.7 million over a nine-month period. But for some of the loans, regulators said a branch manager forged customer signatures on forms approving the transfers and had a profit interest in the company that made loans to customers. **********The state securities group also charged that some of the inter-customer loans, which entail interest charges of up to a tenth of a percent a day -- or 36.5 percent a year -- violated some states' usury laws. In addition, some customers do not pay back their loans -- leaving other customers, rather then the day-trading firm, on the hook. **********Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said today that he would introduce legislation to insure that day traders were aware of the risks associated with the practice. The proposed legislation will require a uniform disclosure statement to be signed by all day-trading customers and will prohibit certain types of loans to day traders, he said. In addition, he said he would call on the Federal Trade Commission to examine the industry's advertising. **********The very existence of the day-trading phenomenon is odd, the state regulators concluded. For individuals who want to speculate, the futures and options markets present ample opportunity, at lower cost and greater leverage. **********''Perhaps day traders are aware that retail customers usually lose money trading futures and options, so they wish to trade a seemingly safer vehicle,'' the report states. ''This usually results in the slower loss of capital, but in loss nonetheless.''"

Then, on arrival, spend each day extolling free trade. **********In the weeks leading up to Bill Clinton's arrival here, it seemed as if  all 3.8 million New Zealanders were outraged. Editorials denouncing Washington for wiping out the livelihood of New Zealand farmers appeared almost daily. Cabdrivers and fishing guides alike chewed out Americans for picking on a country whose entire economy adds up to a fraction of General Motors' revenues. **********But by the time Mr. Clinton, the first President to visit here since Lyndon Johnson, was pulling over his motorcade in small towns and working the crowds as if he still had one election left in him, all seemed forgiven. Thousands lined the streets cheering -- the biggest crowds this tiny country has mustered since it won the America's Cup four years ago. **********''He's probably a lot more popular here than he is back in America,'' Russ Skinner, who teaches at a vocational college, said as he and hundreds other mobbed Mr. Clinton in what is usually a sleepy corner of  this very sleepy city. ''He's been exposed to be nothing more than just a human. And that's made us like him even more.'' **********New Zealand resembles nothing more than England in the 1950's. And the President, who talks endlessly about how we are all in a perpetual footrace for advantage in a super-connected, global economy, seemed happiest luxuriating in a country more disconnected, and perhaps less global, than any developed nation on earth. After all, how many countries still have more sheep than Internet sites, and are proud of it? **********But the Government, facing an election in 11 weeks that it seems likely to lose, was not about to let Mr. Clinton off the meat hook. ''We have fed the President as much fine New Zealand lamb as we could possibly fit in,'' Jenny Shipley, the country's Prime Minister, said today, reminding Mr. Clinton, as cheerfully as she could, that she planned to drag the United States in front of the World Trade Organization. Mr. Clinton's own aides say that New Zealand will probably win, adding that the tariffs were a sop to a few Senators from farm states to win their support on other issues. **********Mr. Clinton proved, once again, that he can't stand to leave anyone unhappy. ''If I were in your position,'' he told Mrs. Shipley, ''that's exactly what I'd do.'' **********Anything You Can Do . . . **********Working for Bill Clinton, one would imagine, is enough of a heart-stopping experience to last a lifetime. There's his explosive temper. There's the risk-taking that led to impeachment. But for Gene Sperling, the head of the National Economic Council, and Douglas Sosnik, one of the President's most senior advisers, the White House simply isn't enough of an adrenaline rush. **********So when Mr. Clinton was spending a day at a glorious resort in Queenstown, playing a staid round of golf in a valley surrounded by jagged snow-covered peaks, Mr. Sperling and Mr. Sosnik were plunging into a 142-foot gorge from a bridge over the Kawarau River. Oh, they were attached to a bungee cord. **********The predictable metaphors to Mr. Clinton's political fortunes ran thick.  Then the press corps pulled up in a bus, en route to a local winery, and discovered their pride was at risk. One by one, reporters and talking heads were leaping into the void. **********The Juggler's Art **********It's hard enough for a country this size to stage one state visit. But Mrs. Shipley is trying to juggle three: Mr. Clinton, President Jiang Zemin of China and President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea. All were here for the summit meeting of Asian leaders, and all decided this was their only moment to work on relations with a country that, Henry Kissinger once  noted, is on the way to nowhere. **********It was quite a performance: Mrs. Shipley would pack two leaders off for sightseeing or to visit a farm family while entertaining the third at a state dinner. By most accounts, Mr. Clinton was having the most fun. **********He had plenty of time to play golf and take his daughter, Chelsea, and his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, out to dinner with the most famous New Zealander of all, Sir Edmund Hillary of Mount Everest fame. (Hillary Clinton decided that the better part of political prudence was to stay in New York working her own crowds.) He visited the Antarctic Center, where expeditions to the American base on Antarctica begin, and threw snowballs in its re-creation of a an Antarctic environment. **********Mr. Jiang, on the other hand, has been shadowed at every turn by protesters shouting at him about China's treatment of Tibet. The crowd was loud enough that on Tuesday Mr. Jiang sent word that he would not go to his state dinner unless New Zealand got rid of the protesters. By the time the police figured out how to get him into the banquet hall without hearing the shouts and protests, he was an hour and a half late. **********''I would like to express my apologies for my lateness,'' Mr. Jiang  said, speaking in English. ''But it was not my fault.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/28/business/kelvin-lancaster-74-dies-revised-economic-theory.html,,1999-07-28,"Kelvin J Lancaster, economic theorist, dies at age 74; photo (M)",706,,The New York Times,Business Day,Biography; Obituary,article,"Kelvin Lancaster, 74, Dies; Revised Economic Theory","Kelvin Lancaster, 74, Dies; Revised Economic Theory"," **********Kelvin J. Lancaster, whose theoretical writings reshaped the economics profession's ideas about trade, industrial structure and regulation, died on Friday at his home in New York City. He was 74. **********The cause was cancer, his son, Clifton, said. **********Mr. Lancaster made two powerful contributions to economic theory, and they were felt far beyond the world of theoreticians. He and R. G. Lipsey wrote an article for Review of Economic Studies (1956-57) that outlined ''The General Theory of Second Best.'' Before Mr. Lancaster, economists generally agreed that society's best option for consumers would be unregulated, perfect competitive markets -- which would drive prices to their bare minimum. That is why economists used to reflexively call for lifting tariffs or other barriers to free trade. **********But Mr. Lancaster asked a simple, if intellectually shattering, question: Is free trade for all goods still best in the face of market flaws somewhere in the economy? For example, what if strong unions drove up wages and prices in the domestic auto industry, causing production to fall below its ideal level? **********Mr. Lancaster's work showed that under these circumstances, a tariff on foreign cars could raise consumer demand for domestic cars, offsetting the depressive impact of unions on domestic production. Mr. Lancaster's point is that economists ought not jump to conclusions: when the best option -- perfect competition everywhere -- is impossible, society's second-best option might run counter to the economists' clarion calls for free trade and unfettered competition. **********Mr. Lancaster's elegantly analyzed proposition was that economists forever after needed to carefully determine what policies worked best in a world where some markets work well, but others work poorly. A colleague, Prof. Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University, said after Mr. Lancaster's death ''that economists constantly pay homage to Mr. Lancaster's insight, often prefacing a policy pronouncement with the reminder, 'In the world of the second best. . .' '' **********Mr. Lancaster's second major contribution was to revise the economic tool for analyzing consumer demand. Before him, economists studied the demand for a whole product -- how much consumers were willing to pay for bananas compared with apples. But Mr. Lancaster developed the theory for analyzing more basic preferences -- for something's underlying characteristics. For cars, that might require analyzing consumer demand for horsepower versus weight and fuel economy. That might seem an obvious way to analyze demand, but  Mr. Lancaster's theory paved the way for economists to tackle a surprising array of new problems. **********For example, classical theory held that countries would ordinarily trade with countries that looked like their opposites: The high-tech United States would export computers to the Third World in exchange for commodities like copper. But in fact the bulk of United States trade takes place with similarly industrialized places like Canada, Japan and Western Europe. Mr. Lancaster provided the ingredients for a potent explanation. Europe and the United States shipped cars back and forth because they specialized in cars with different characteristics. **********Only by breaking down the analysis of consumer demand into constituent characteristics, economists came to realize, could they understand something as basic as trade flows. Prof. James Heckman of the University of Chicago said ''Mr. Lancaster's theories have had a wide variety of applications, for example, giving companies a tool to analyze how consumers will react to the introduction of new goods -- goods that do not yet exist but that offer consumers bundles of characteristics whose demand can be studied on the basis of past purchasing patterns.'' **********Mr. Lancaster was born in Sydney, Australia, and volunteered for the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. He earned undergraduate degrees in English literature, geology and mathematics at Sydney University, and received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of London in 1958. **********Mr. Lancaster was the John Bates Clark Professor of Economics at Columbia University and served twice as the department's chairman. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and elected as a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association. **********He is survived by his wife, Deborah Grunfeld Lancaster; two sons, Clifton, of Avon, Conn. and Gilead, of Redding, Conn., and five grandchildren. **********''He was widely regarded as a potential recipient of the Nobel Prize,'' said Professor Bhagwati. ''He joins the list of extraordinary economists whom death deprived of this singular honor.''"

The highway to Belgrade was blocked by a solid mass of refugees. Many pulled over to the shoulder to camp among the trees. **********Residents watched them pass, remembering previous tides of Serbian refugees from other wars. **********''We are not happy about anything to do with this war,'' said a resident of Krusevac, who gave her name as Sanje and said she was a refugee from Bosnia. ''And now we are seeing a lot of buses and cars of refugees. We feel nothing good at all.'' **********The Government has played down the exodus on state television and has not offered any estimate of the numbers. The Yugoslav Red Cross said it had counted 40,000. NATO put the number at  80,000 over the last week. **********Whatever the number, that is in addition to 70,000 other Serbs who fled Kosovo over the last two months of NATO bombing. Where those people will live and work, whether they will return to Kosovo, and how they will be fed and cared for are the latest ripples of the Kosovo problem to confront President Slobodan Milosevic's administration. **********When asked, many refugees said they had little doubt whom  they fault. **********''It's all Milosevic's fault,'' said Zlate Djordjevic, a lawyer, who was driving a truck out of Kosovo. **********The refugees appear more resigned than angry, and they do not look very likely to march on Belgrade soon. **********Today, many huddled under plastic sheeting as a thunderstorm broke overhead. Asked where they would go, most answered, ''I don't know.'' **********Those who have no relatives to stay with are being directed to centers in schools and other public buildings. They are joining tens of thousands of Serbian refugees from wars in Croatia and Bosnia over the last eight years. **********Those previous waves have ended up nearly forgotten, living in depressed conditions throughout Serbia, surviving on meager handouts of food, but mostly left to fend for themselves. **********Many new arrivals will turn to the Government for food and shelter. Asked how they will survive, one said: **********''We'll go to the refugee center and register. We are not refugees, because we are in our own country. But we'll be living on humanitarian aid.'' **********The road just north of the Kosovo border at Merdare was solid with new arrivals. Soldiers mingled with peasant farmers, white-collar workers from the cities and dozens of Gypsy families. **********A young reservist, Slavise, was still in his uniform as he accompanied his mother out of Kosovo, where her family had lived for centuries. He said he did not know where they would go. But he said he knew he would not be going back. **********Asked whether Serbs and Albanians could live together after what had occurred over the last two months in Kosovo, he answered no. A group of men gathered around him said they were fleeing the Kosovo Liberation Army, but not their Albanian neighbors. The men said they would stay in Kosovo only if NATO could guarantee their safety. **********''We are not afraid of ordinary Albanians,'' Mr. Djordjevic said. ''I will return in a few weeks, I hope, when it is more secure.'' **********But others, when pressed, said they thought that they would never be able to return. Asked whether Albanians would nurture hatred for the Serbs, the group stood in glum silence. **********Many Serbs offered conspiracy theories about what went wrong in Kosovo. But nearly all those leaving agreed that for whatever reason the policies of recent years have proved disastrous. Most still blame the Kosovo Liberation Army and Albanian extremists who want independence from Serbia. But they blame equally the leadership in Belgrade for not crushing the separatists. **********Many at first try to denied that ''ethnic cleansing'' or organized killing of Albanian civilians had occurred in Kosovo. But when confronted with strong evidence, even they acknowledged that things happened. A few not only acknowledged that atrocities occurred, but also agreed that such violence had forever made it impossible for Serbs to live in Kosovo. **********''We could have lived with our Albanian neighbors, but not with the guerrillas,'' Slobodan Filipovic, a storekeeper from Prizren, said. ''I left my apartment keys with our Albanian neighbors. They were crying. They wanted us to stay. They wanted to protect us, but they couldn't.''"

Of this, one of the most closely followed measurements is so-called click data, which focuses on who has clicked on an advertising banner or some other particular link. Web site publishers, advertising agencies and companies that buy those ads have relied heavily on that data to build their businesses, and until now they have been generous about sharing it freely with each other. **********Now one of the Internet's biggest advertisers is raising the question of whether that data belongs to anyone but the advertisers, and the resulting debate could shape the future of the advertiser-publisher relationship. **********According to executives within the Internet advertising industry, I.B.M. is testing new techniques of serving its ads to Internet users in a way that prevents publishers from knowing who clicked on I.B.M. ads displayed on their Web sites. I.B.M., these executives say, may then withhold the click data from publishers unless they can be persuaded to do otherwise. **********An I.B.M. official declined to comment about the proposed policy, saying it was premature to speculate. Indeed, industry executives said the company had merely floated the idea of claiming ownership of click data. But the I.B.M. talk has brought the issue of data ownership to a head, and given new impetus to a debate that has loomed as one of the most important facing the industry. **********''This is just the tip of the iceberg; and the bottom of that iceberg is the issue of who owns the data,'' said Michael Donahue, executive vice president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. ''The ad agencies don't want to be cut out because they want access to that data. The advertisers say, 'It's my money, so it's my data,' and the publishers say, 'That ad is part of my site's content, so it's my data.' '' **********The possibility of losing access to click data has sent a shiver up the spines of Web site publishers, who rely on these statistics to gauge the effectiveness of advertising and to gather information about the buying interests of their users. That data is tremendously valuable to publishers, who can command high advertising fees for showing, for example, a mortgage company's ad to someone who has recently clicked on an advertisement for a realtor. **********Publishers also fear that if I.B.M. assumes such a stance, other advertisers will follow suit. Beyond I.B.M.'s considerable spending power -- industry executives rank the company as one of the top three advertisers on the Internet -- it has been influential in shaping industry policies. I.B.M. spearheaded an effort earlier this year, for instance, to force Web site publishers to post privacy statements or lose the company's advertising. **********Internet advertising executives cite two potential justifications for withholding click data. For one thing, their traditional relationship with print publishers and television and radio networks suggests that the data belongs to advertisers. The ad buyers generally do not share the results of advertising campaigns with networks or print publishers when those media run so-called direct response advertisements -- for example, a commercial that invites viewers to call an ''800'' number to buy a product. **********Advertisers acknowledge that Internet publishers play a far more active role in bringing qualified buyers to their doorstep than other media. But they also make the point that the Internet ultimately resembles the direct response model, so they could be justified in handling the data in a similar manner. **********Of equal importance for some advertisers is the suspicion that publishers and other companies that deliver ads are not above selling click data to an advertiser's competitor. These companies espouse a so-called Chinese wall policy dictating, for instance, that publishers do not sell information about people who clicked on one car company's ad banner to another car company. But industry executives say that there are violations. ''I don't think it's pervasive, but there are people doing it,'' said Kevin O'Connnor, chief executive of Doubleclick Inc., an Internet advertising network. ''And advertisers want to put a stop to it.'' **********According to industry executives who spoke on condition of anonymity, I.B.M.'s new advertising approach enables it to deliver ads from its own server computers -- a departure from the norm, since advertisers generally rely on publishers or third-party advertising companies like Doubleclick and Flycast to deliver ads on their behalf. Moreover, the way the ads are coded prevents publishers from tracking who clicked on I.B.M.'s ad banners. **********Most other advertisers, of course, lack the technological wherewithal to deliver their own ads or to otherwise separate publishers from click data. But publishers fear other advertisers could eventually deliver their ads in a manner similar to I.B.M.'s new technique. Or, even if they lack the technical expertise to block access, advertisers might seek either to contractually prevent publishers from using that data or to force publishers to pay for it. **********Industry executives say that I.B.M. is sensitive to concerns about causing a ripple effect, having staked a good measure of its business future on the growth of the e-commerce industry. But as the company joins others in pouring millions of advertising dollars into the Internet economy -- and as the value of customer data continues to rise -- I.B.M. may decide that now is the time to establish a precedent on the matter. **********According to Vivienne Bechtold, director of interactive marketing for Procter & Gamble, the issue could force advertisers to re-evaluate the role of publishers in helping to build ad campaigns. Ms. Bechtold, who is also a member of a coalition of Internet advertising and publishing leaders known as the Future of Advertising Stakeholders, or FAST, stressed that Procter & Gamble had not determined its own position on the issue. **********''I can understand why I.B.M. would consider this stance,'' she said. ''On the other hand, the dynamics of the Internet raise the question: If we share the data, would advertisers benefit more from that collective expertise than if we treated them in the traditional, customer-supplier way?'' **********Ultimately, she said, ''advertisers could adopt a hybrid approach, where we choose to share with some, while with others, we treat it in the traditional way.'' **********Other trends are complicating the matter, including the tendency of advertisers to establish so-called ''pay for performance'' deals with Web sites. In those agreements, a publisher's payment is often based on the percentage of users who click on ad banners, so advertisers would naturally disclose click data to publishers. Other advertising deals remain on a ''CPM'' model, whereby advertisers pay a set rate, typically in the $25 range, for every thousand banners shown on a site. But about half of Internet advertising deals are a combination of pay-for-performance and CPM, so disputes over who owns the data could quickly muddy the waters. **********Publishers, meanwhile, are using so-called ''collaborative filtering'' technology to aim ads at consumers on their sites -- and can offer even more precise targets  when they know what ads their customers are clicking on. Indeed, according to Anil Singh, chief sales and marketing officer for Yahoo: ''We can target clusters of our audience that have a higher propensity to click on certain types of offers. That's a great service for advertisers. If we were unable to collect data in that effort, it would hurt the services we could offer our clients.'' **********At the same time, a growing number of advertisers are choosing to deliver their ads through third-party servers like Doubleclick and Flycast, which also rely extensively on click data. Those companies have much at stake as well. ''Are we willing to step back and not have access to the data?'' asked Doubleclick's Mr. O'Connor. ''I'm not so sure. It could very well not be a good thing for the advertisers.'' **********At the center of this issue is Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau, an industry group that represents Internet publishers. Mr. LeFurgy, who is also the chairman of FAST, said the advertising bureau and I.B.M. were seeking common ground. ''They understand our position, we understand theirs,'' he said. ''But this is stuff that's not to be underestimated in terms of its importance and implications.'' **********Internet publishers, however, have little leverage in the debate, in the view of Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''Advertisers are ultimately the source of all the money, so they hold the trump card in this,'' Mr. Nail said. ''If they want to do it, they can.''"

And the closely watched ''core'' inflation rate -- which excludes volatile food and energy prices -- edged up a mere one-tenth of 1 percent versus a four-tenths of 1 percent increase in April. **********While the Federal Reserve is still expected to raise short-term interest rates at its meeting later this month, the absence of any signs of inflation last month eased worries that the Fed was about to embark on a sustained series of rate increases. **********A wave of relief swept the stock and bond markets, which both rallied yesterday. **********The Dow Jones industrial average advanced nearly 190 points, to 10,784.95, and the Nasdaq composite, encouraged as well by a surprisingly robust earnings report from the software maker Oracle, jumped more than 103 points, to 2,517.83, surpassing its previous record one-day point gain of 96.05, set Feb. 11. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell as soon as the report was released, ending the day at 6.06 percent versus 6.11 late Tuesday. **********''The market was expecting several tightening moves by the Fed,'' said Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust. ''Today's data lower the probability.'' **********Indeed, a sustained campaign to raise interest rates such as the one conducted by the Fed from early 1994 to early 1995 seems much less likely now. **********But most analysts say the Fed will probably engineer a modest rate increase of one-quarter of a percentage point at the end of its June 29-30 meeting. Not only have several voting members of the Fed's Open Market Committee been making hawkish noises in public lately, but all indications are that the economy is still growing too fast for the Fed's comfort. **********''People are still very confused and very cautious,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ''Everyone knows Greenspan is talking tomorrow and everybody expects him to give us the word.'' **********Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to testify on the economy today to a Congressional committee. **********To most Americans basking in the lowest unemployment and inflation rates since the 1960's, the notion that the Fed is fretting about a revival of inflation may seem puzzling, if not outlandish. But if the central bank waits for actual inflation to take off, analysts warn, it has probably waited too long. Fed actions may affect stock and bond prices instantly, but they take a lot longer -- a year or more -- to work their way through the economy. **********''The Fed is worrying about what the C.P.I. will do six to 12 months down the road,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the Fleet Bank in Hartford. **********In fact, when Fed officials issued a list of their concerns on April 18 in disclosing that their next move was more likely to be up than down, there was no mention of current inflation at all. Instead the Fed focused on factors affecting the speed of the eight-year-old expansion: strong domestic demand, tight labor markets and economic recoveries abroad. **********Since then, the Government has released more data suggesting that the economy is not slowing down as much as expected. Yesterday only added more fuel to that fire. Housing starts rose 6.3 percent in May after a sharp drop in April, the Census Department reported. And the Fed said that factory output climbed for the fourth consecutive month in May as manufacturers churned out more cars and computers. Last week, there was fresh evidence that Germany and Japan were on the road to recovery. **********Meanwhile, several forces that have helped restrain inflation are fading. Oil prices, which plummeted during the Asian crisis, have climbed recently. The increases have leveled off in the last six weeks or so, but as the rest of the world begins growing again further increases are likely. The same is true for the prices of  commodities like copper and aluminum, which are still depressed but have been rising recently at the fastest pace in more than two years. **********Still, there are few signs of the usual precursors of a sustained pick-up in inflation. **********Productivity gains, which usually peter out as economic expansions get older, have sped up. Last quarter, productivity was up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, and over the last four years productivity growth has averaged 2 percent, twice the rate of the previous two decades. **********As a result, labor costs per unit of output have been rising more slowly during this expansion than during any since the 1940's. They were up just 1.4 percent in the first quarter. Moreover, American industry, in the wake of a huge investment boom, has a lot of excess capacity. Even though  production has been rising, the utilization rate is still around 80 percent. **********''Producers would like to raise prices, but I'm not sure they can on a steady basis,'' said Katherine Kobe, an economist at Joel Popkin Associates, a forecasting firm based in Washington. **********Today's low inflation is giving consumers plenty to celebrate. In May, the price of moving around fell. Gasoline prices, which accounted for half of April's surge in consumer prices, fell 1.3 percent after soaring 15 percent in April. **********Air fares dropped, too, partly because fuel prices were flat. And despite near-record car sales, the prices of new and used models also declined. **********Clothing also got cheaper, as it had been doing for some time until April. That's partly because so much of it is imported and partly because a lot of the fabrics are, too. **********The price of shelter fell as well. **********Computers continued to get cheaper, down nearly 2 percent last month. So far this year, computer prices have been falling at an annual rate of more than 30 percent. **********Perhaps more important, given the graying of America, is that increases in the price of medical care, which had been rising briskly of late, slowed in May. **********Some things that have been bargains did get more expensive last month, however. Food prices jumped six-tenths of 1 percent."

Bonds reacted badly to a report from the National Association of Purchasing Management showing renewed vigor in the economy. The report, coupled with news last Friday that the economy grew at a 5.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, left bond traders fearful of what the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee might decide to do at a meeting scheduled for today. **********''We are at a transition point, where investors have begun to realize from these economic reports that the sky is not falling, that profits are at or above expectations, but that further reductions in interest rates by the Fed are off the table,'' Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said. ''We need to get beyond the F.O.M.C. meeting and come to grips with the fact that this year the Fed is probably going to be on the sidelines and that earnings have to be the driving force behind higher stock prices.'' **********Some of the biggest technology stocks were among the biggest losers. **********Intel fell 3 1/16, to 137 7/8.

Citigroup, which owns Travelers insurance, declined 1 9/16, to 54 1/2. **********Takeover news caused the prices of Aeroquip-Vickers and Morton International to jump.

The commission found that they had failed to tell the whole truth about the event. And, the commission ruled, the men had acted without the authority of the political party they belonged to, therefore they did not have the necessary ''political mandate.'' **********The Hani case has been one of the most watched cases before the Truth Commission, drawing hundreds of spectators during weeks of hearings in Pretoria. The Hani family, the Communist Party and the ruling African National Congress fiercely opposed the granting of amnesty. **********Janusz Walus, who fired the shots that killed Mr. Hani at his Johannesburg home on Easter morning in 1993, and Clive Derby-Lewis, who planned the killing and supplied the gun, were both sentenced to death in 1993. But their sentences were commuted when the death penalty was abolished by Mr. Mandela's Government. **********In applying for amnesty, Mr. Derby-Lewis, a former Conservative Party member of Parliament, said he had plotted the killing to create chaos and spark a right-wing coup. Mr. Walus, a Polish immigrant who fled to South Africa in 1981 to escape the communism he hated in his homeland, said he had killed Mr. Hani to try to stop communists taking power in his new home. **********But during hearings into their applications, both fluctuated between combative and overly nonchalant answers. The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty to those who had acted with political motive and who confess all, found many of their explanations to be less than truthful. For instance, it refused to believe Mr. Derby-Lewis when he said he had bought a gun with a specially made silencer so that he would not disturb his neighbors if he had to shoot at intruders. **********''We have no hesitation in rejecting Derby-Lewis's evidence in this regard,'' the commission said in its 25-page ruling. **********The applicants also gave several explanations for why a list of A.N.C. officials' names had been collected and numbered. At one point, Mr. Derby-Lewis said this was a code so that the officials could be discussed over the phone without mentioning names. Mr. Walus gave a different explanation: They were ordered according to their enmity towards the Conservative Party. **********The commission flatly rejected these explanations, saying the list, which included addresses and had a number 1 next to President Mandela's name, was clearly a hit list. The commission also found that the Conservative Party had never authorized assassinations. **********Mr. Hani had been the chief of staff of the African National Congress's armed wing. He returned home after the A.N.C. and the Communist Party were unbanned in 1990. He became a hugely popular speaker in the black townships. At the time of his death, he was ranked just behind Mr. Mandela in popularity polls."

The Prime Minister-elect met all day with top members of his One Israel party, a reconstituted version of Labor, to mete out ministries -- those still available after he reached a coalition agreement with six other political parties last week. **********A political moderate, Mr. Levy has said he strongly favors trading land for peace and moving quickly forward to resume negotiations with the Palestinians and with Syria. Palestinian officials welcomed news of his appointment, although Palestinian and Israeli analysts say they expect that Mr. Barak will be guiding foreign policy. **********Mr. Levy himself acknowledged as much in a radio interview today. **********''The Prime Minister makes the policy and the Foreign Minister carries it out,'' he said. **********Mr. Barak and his new Government will be sworn in on Wednesday, ending a seven-week limbo period in which Benjamin Netanyahu, the outgoing Prime Minister, and his Cabinet lingered on. **********The emerging picture of Mr. Barak's Cabinet shows an overwhelming majority of doves, with not even a handful of old-time hawks. So it should not be an ordeal for Mr. Barak to line up his Cabinet behind him on peace agreements, as it was for Mr. Netanyahu -- if the new Prime Minister maintains good political relations with his ministers. **********As it is shaping up, the 18-member Cabinet will be male except for Dalia Itzhik of the Labor/One Israel party, whose appointment is definite even though it is not clear what post she will receive. The Cabinet will mostly consist of men over age 50. **********And, with seven parties representing left, right, secular and religious, it will be an ideological smorgasbord, which some experts say reflects a sea change in Israeli politics. **********''The composition of Barak's Government proves that the grand ideologies in Israel have died, or at least are dying, quietly and out of the spotlight,'' Sever Plotzker, a veteran analyst, wrote in the newspaper Haaretz. ''There was almost no disagreement on the new Government's guidelines; on how to divide the pie, who gets what and how much, there was plenty of disagreement.'' **********Because Mr. Barak will serve as his own Defense Minister, his Foreign Minister will technically be second in command. Some express doubt that Mr. Levy, who is not considered a visionary, will play a profound role. **********But others say Mr. Levy can be expected to do some battling for control of policy -- especially if Shimon Peres, the former Prime Minister, is appointed to what would be a newly created post of Minister of Regional Development, as expected. **********Mr. Levy, who was born and reared in Morocco, rose to prominence in the 1960's as a municipal leader and a union leader in the construction trade. **********He became an Israeli legend as one of the first North African immigrants -- and the rare-blue collar worker -- to battle his way into the country's elite. His rise, which was accompanied by much mockery from that elite, mirrored the transformation of the Sephardic working class into a pivotal electoral bloc. **********He joined Mr. Barak's One Israel party during the campaign and played a major role in persuading many longtime members of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party of Middle Eastern origin to abandon their party for Mr. Barak. **********Mr. Levy was first elected to the Parliament in 1969, when he was 31, and he has served continuously ever since. His mentor, Menachem Begin, considered him a political natural and took him under his wing in the conservative Herut Party, which later became Likud. **********Mr. Levy assumed his first Cabinet post, Minister of Housing, when Mr. Begin became Prime Minister in 1977. But he opposed Mr. Begin's war in Lebanon in the early 1980's. **********In 1990, when Yitzhak Shamir appointed him Foreign Minister for the first time, the choice was scoffed at because of Mr. Levy's lack of diplomatic experience and his rudimentary knowledge of English. Mr. Shamir, who made the appointment under political pressure, was not a big fan and kept his own Foreign Minister out of his inner circle. **********Before long, though, some critics were turned around by what seemed to be Mr. Levy's instinctive diplomatic skills, although criticism of his administrative skills and what was perceived as his thin-skinned ambition dogged him through both of his previous terms. **********He formed his own party, Gesher, in 1995 as a social issues party representing Sephardic immigrants. Gesher joined forces with Mr. Netanyahu the next year, the same way it melded into One Israel this spring. **********Mr. Levy served as Mr. Netanyahu's Foreign Minister, but quit in January 1998. He said he was frustrated with the Prime Minister's political conduct and with the stagnation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort. **********Among other key appointments announced so far: Natan Sharansky, the Russian immigrant leader, will be Interior Minister; Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist Meretz Party, will be Education Minister; Yitzhak Mordechai, the former Defense Minister, will be Transportation Minister, and Shas, the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic party, will have the Health, Infrastructure and Labor Ministries. **********It was still unclear tonight who would hold the key post of Finance Minister."

We have risen to political power and created a high-technology world that will shape the future. On the calendar, we have been but a blip in this millennium, but one that has made much noise. Who can dispute that boomers are on top now? **********But as we celebrate on Friday, we should be aware that what dawns on Saturday will be the beginning of the end of baby-boomer dominance. It won't be our millennium; it won't even be our century. I suspect that when our great-grandchildren celebrate the arrival of 2100, the phrase baby boomer will have long gone out of the vocabulary. What exactly was a flapper, anyway? **********So what will happen to boomers in the next century? We will soon know whether boomers were able to accomplish the basics, like saving enough for retirement and enough to send the baby boomlet through college, and some of us may learn whether it was wise to spend $1 million in the New York suburbs for a five-bedroom home on a quarter-acre lot. Will we really be retiring early, as many of us dream, or will we be hanging on until someone puts us out to pasture? **********To get an idea of what is in store for us, I asked two experts, both of them baby boomers themselves: Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University, who has long studied wealth and its effects, and Bambi Holzer, a senior vice president for investments at PaineWebber, who wrote ''Retire Rich: The Baby Boomer's Guide to a Secure Future'' (John Wiley & Sons, 1998). **********Optimistic about their generation, both  said boomers were likely to meet all their financial goals. Mr. Wolff said it would be a remarkable achievement, considering that boomers entered the work force when the economy was stagnant and that the sheer volume of workers kept wages low. And the money they did have, he said, they spent. **********''This was the spendthrift generation 20 years ago, the generation that didn't save at all,'' he said. ''Now they've accumulated a large amount of wealth. It will turn out that they did better than their parents because their parents were more conservative. Baby boomers have been much more adventurous.'' **********Mr. Wolff said his research showed that in 1998, the average wealth of baby boomers 44 to 49 years old was about $245,000, more than 60 percent more than what their parents had at the same age, adjusted for inflation. **********He and Ms. Holzer said one reason was that with the decline of traditional pensions, boomers had to take over saving for their retirement. That taught them how to invest. **********''The baby boomer generation was the first do-it-yourself generation in investing,'' she said. ''As a result of that education, our generation is aware of the investment process. It has been forecast that the 401(k) assets amassed by individuals will be greater than the value of their homes.'' **********IF we're so smart, will we be smart enough to get out in time, before a market crash? **********Mr. Wolff says yes, and he even thinks that we probably won't get stuck with overpriced houses. But it may not have anything to do with savvy. We will just become more conservative with money. **********''I think what's going to happen is those close to retirement are going to buy retirement homes,'' he said. ''Boomers will also begin to diversify more into bonds and liquid assets, such as CD's and Treasury bills. And they will pay off outstanding mortgages.'' **********On retirement, Mr. Wolff and Ms. Holzer both predicted that boomers wouldn't keep it simple. ''Boomers won't want a rocking-chair retirement,'' Ms. Holzer said. **********Mr. Wolff said boomers did not identify with careers as their parents did and would  gladly let go of the reins. They would then direct energies elsewhere. **********''Baby boomers are more interested in personal fulfillment,'' he said. ''They will be much more in tune with bettering themselves. I think they will still be a force politically and culturally and will contribute to the intellectual life of the country.'' **********That's quite an assessment for a generation that had such a countercultural start. Boomers, Mr. Wolff said, will accomplish their goals ''despite their gloomy beginning and the initial perception of the generation, much to our parents' surprise.''"

Even Russia is reviving a bit. But for all the relief that brings, the global financial meltdown remains a haunting memory -- not as searing as the Depression for a generation of Americans, but scary enough. And just as the Depression brought regulation to America's financial markets, the Asian and Russian crises are forcing rules on the global market. **********That is a striking shift in course. The thousands of lenders and borrowers who move money among themselves in what is called the global financial market had counted on markets to heal themselves without much oversight. Many economists encouraged that view, until Asia took a dive. And now public officials with the power to regulate global markets are speaking more explicitly than ever about actually doing so. **********They are not thumping pulpits about it.  But in interviews, speeches and forum discussions at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, held here last week, some officials offered views they would not have dared to put on the record six months ago. **********''There is a growing acceptance in the official international community that you tremendously increase the risk of triggering volatility and crisis if rules are not made for the proper structuring of debt,'' Jack Boorman, the I.M.F.'s director of policy development, said in an interview. Volatility is a euphemism for the panicky rush of foreign lenders out of Asia, then Russia, and then Brazil. Credit even dried up in the United States last fall, until a worried Federal Reserve abruptly cut rates. **********While the World Bank had spoken out for global rule-making, the I.M.F. had held back, and so had the Clinton Administration. But it was clear at last week's meeting that they, too, have now come on board. **********The Asian crisis has imposed on all of them a common frame of reference. It goes like this: The global capital market, like national markets, is neither self-regulating nor self-curing. Left alone, lenders and borrowers tend to operate with too much exuberance, on the one extreme, and then pull back too far in panic, on the other. **********''Crises are, in a sense, accidents,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, in a speech last Sunday. ''As with accidents, crises will never be eliminated, and are not amenable to silver-bullet solutions. Think of auto accidents: If one looks back at any auto accident, there are always many things that could have combined to produce greater safety.'' **********Given that recognition, the new rule-making -- or accident prevention, as Mr. Summers put it -- is under way. It is now openly recognized that lenders must be regulated, and negotiations have begun over what strictures to impose on them. (Hapless borrowers have been lectured from all sides since the global crisis started in 1997 on how they should have behaved and must now behave.) **********''There is more belief now in the necessity of controls on both the lending and the borrowing side,'' said Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s first deputy managing director. **********The lenders, after all, are part of a system that can swing too easily from optimism to pessimism. These swings are facilitated by short-term loans, which lenders prefer to long-term lending. Loans of less than a year are less expensive for lenders because banks need not keep as large a percentage of the loans' value in reserve. And short-term loans can be withdrawn quickly in a crisis, which makes the lenders whole but tends to deepen the crisis. **********Borrowers are also tempted by short-term loans. They can often borrow abroad for the short term at relatively low interest rates and re-lend the borrowed money long term at home at higher rates. They gamble that the short-term loans will be renewed indefinitely, not suddenly withdrawn in panic. **********One goal of the new rule-making is to discourage short-term lending in favor of long-term loans, which are less likely to finance speculation and more likely to finance factories and similar investments. Not surprisingly, this shift is turning out to be the hardest part of the new rule-making process. **********LENDERS, naturally, are opposed. ''Presumably the market, on its own, will find the right balance between short-  and long-term credit,'' said James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers Association. **********Public officials are sensitive to this resistance. Still, there is much talk of raising reserve requirements on short-term loans, and of requiring bondholders to postpone repayment in the event of a crisis. **********Tougher proposals come more slowly to the table. One is the so-called Chile approach: When short-term foreign loans enter in great quantity, Chile requires the foreign lenders to deposit a percentage of each loan in a noninterest-bearing account -- a tax, in effect, that raises a loan's cost. Such a strong deterrent never entered Treasury Secretary Robert E.

Nichols, the dictionary's editorial director, said she was considering adding the usage warnings earlier this year when a language snarl hit the rival dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster Inc. In that episode, the publisher and America Online Inc. removed an electronic version of Merriam's classic collegiate thesaurus for revisions after complaints that a word list for ''homosexual'' included synonyms without any warning that the words were slurs. **********''That only confirmed to me that it's not only a good idea, but a great idea'' to provide warnings, Ms. Nichols said. ''Increasingly, people also expect a dictionary to give guidance about words that are better avoided for fear of accidentally causing offense.'' **********Random House is owned by Bertelsmann A.G. The bright red dust jacket for its new 1,571-page dictionary promises ''more new words than any other dictionary'' and ''clear guidance on avoiding offensive language.'' **********In some cases, the word warnings appear even before the definitions. ''Holy roller,'' for example, is first labeled: ''A slur and must be avoided. It is perceived as insulting.'' Then comes the definition: ''A contemptuous term used to refer to a member of a Pentecostal sect.'' **********Milder words with double meanings come with weaker alerts. ''Babe,'' for instance, is first defined as ''a baby or small child.'' **********But the dictionary adds a final note, leaving it to the reader to decide whether to use it as a term of endearment or insult: ''sometimes used with disparaging intent and perceived as insulting or demeaning to women'' as well as ''an affectionate term of address used by a man or woman to a sweetheart.''

The controversy apparently stemmed from a statement issued on Wednesday by the NATO force in Kosovo that at least four bodies found at the site were those of Serbs. **********That statement was retracted today, and no firm details were offered on results of the exhumation of the bodies by investigators from the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. American soldiers found the bodies on July 24 after local people reported their existence. **********This investigation in eastern Kosovo is the only instance known where the war crimes tribunal is involved in investigating killings that may have been committed by Albanians against Serbs. **********The Yugoslav Government used Wednesday's statement about Serbian victims as what it terms further proof that the NATO-led force in Kosovo and the United Nations administration here are not protecting the province's few remaining Serbs, and to reiterate its demand to allow Serbian forces to move in to do so. **********The Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, called for an urgent session of the United Nations Security Council to discuss reports of the mass grave site and accused the NATO-led force, known by its acronym KFOR, of covering up the discovery, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported. **********''The fact that the U.S. KFOR troops, in whose area this crime against humanity was discovered, knew about the case on July 24 and have concealed it from the international public ever since indicates an intention to cover up this revolting massacre,'' Tanjug said, citing a Foreign Ministry statement. **********Amplifying the statement from NATO forces on Wednesday, Maj. Erik Gunnars, public affairs officer at the American troops' base at Gniljane, in eastern Kosovo, said today that the 15 bodies discovered appeared to include Albanians killed during the war over the province, as well as Serbs killed after hostilities ceased. **********Paul Risley, spokesman for the tribunal in The Hague, said by telephone from the Netherlands that two of the bodies might be those of Serbs who went missing after NATO troops arrived in Kosovo in June. Mr. Risley said, however, that the tentative identification was based only on a description of the clothes worn by the victims. **********Some, if not all, of the dead appear to have been executed, said Capt. Larry Kaminski, another spokesman for the American forces in Gniljane. If the victims were civilians killed by an armed party, the killings would constitute a war crime, Mr. Risley said. Revenge killings or straight criminal acts would not be prosecuted as war crimes, he added. **********Today, spokesmen for the NATO-led force in Pristina said that they could not confirm Wednesday's statement that four of the victims were Serbs and that they had no information as to whether any of  the bodies found were those of Serbs or Albanians. **********The grave site is cut into an earth bank close to a stream forded by a dirt track. Thick woods cover the steep sides of the valley on all sides. **********Lying amid the dust and stones are scraps of human hair, what appear to be vertebrae, and several black plastic bags. Flies and a heavy sickly smell hang over the site. **********Nexhmedin Mustafa, a young farmer from the nearby village of Podgrade, said he came to the site before the bodies were removed. ''The graves were very shallow, he said. ''I saw a leg sticking out here,  You could see the clothes of some of them.'' **********He said one of the bodies seemed to be that of a child between 7 and 10. He also said he had seen spent cartridges on the ground just yards from the graves, which have been marked by a white piece of webbing by the investigators. **********Eleven bodies were found in these shallow graves, according to the NATO-led force. Two others were found in a nearby pool of water, and four more were found unburied some 600 yards away. **********Local villagers showed an uncomfortable silence when asked about the grave site. Most denied knowledge of its existence, although they recounted in detail other deaths in the region during the war. **********''We don't know if they were Serb or Albanian,'' said Ekrem Sherifi, of Podgrade. ''We were thrown out of our village during the war. We weren't here when it happened.''"

So perhaps it is only natural that alongside technology shares, luxury-goods stocks have ridden a wave of investor favor: by last Thursday, the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter luxury goods index had doubled from its level a year earlier. **********''The world is getting richer,'' said Andrew November, director of global strategy at Hill Samuel Asset Management in London. He added that ''more and more people can afford these goods, especially in the emerging markets.'' **********In Europe, of course, much of the glow surrounding luxury goods has been generated by mergers. Gucci Group, for instance, which is awash in $3 billion in cash after it sold 42 percent of its equity earlier this year to the French billionaire, Francois Pinault, wants to transform itself into a multibrand giant. In the last 12 months, its shares returned 128 percent. **********In Switzerland, Compagnie Financiere Richemont, which owns the jeweler Cartier and luxury watchmakers like Vacheron Constantin and Baume & Mercier, decided earlier this year to swap out of cigarette and cable television businesses it owned in order to focus on luxury goods. Rene Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, believes that Richemont will eventually use the proceeds for luxury acquisitions. Richemont's shares returned 94 percent over the last 12 months. **********In October, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of France announced an alliance with Prada, the Italian fashion house, to acquire 51 percent of Fendi, the design house in Rome. LVMH shares have returned 124.7 percent in the last 12 months. **********Another, somewhat unlikely, entry in the luxury sweepstakes is Switzerland's Swatch, which has assembled a stable of luxury watchmakers that includes Omega and Blancpain. In the last 12 months, its  regular shares have returned 42.9 percent. **********Some experts think the run-ups mean that the stocks are fully priced. The core European luxury goods companies in the Morgan Stanley index, for example, traded at 33 times estimated 2000 earnings last week, versus a like multiple of 18 just 12 months ago. Ken Cox, a money manager at Templeton Funds in Britain, said he had held shares of Gucci but accepted Mr. Pinault's tender offer earlier this year. **********Yet other experts said that, despite rising P/E's, there is still value to be extracted. **********Michel Legros, a money manager at Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management in London, said that while LVMH has cut costs  at many of its businesses, its apparel and Hennessy Cognac divisions could benefit from efficiency drives. Gian Luca Manca, an analyst at HSBC Securities, calls LVMH his favorite luxury goods stock. He says the shares, which closed at 332.1 euros on Friday, will outpace the market by 5 to 10 percent over 12 months. **********Sagrar Maceira de Rosen, an analyst at J. P. Morgan in London, said she believed that Gucci offers growth opportunities. In October, she started coverage of Gucci with a buy rating and says its move last week to acquire control of Yves Saint Laurent was ''strategically very positive.'' She said the shares, which closed at 82.45 euros, or $85.7645, on Friday, could hit $100 in a year. **********Mr. Weber of Vontobel is enthusiastic about Richemont and Swatch, now trading at 3298 and 264.5 Swiss francs, respectively. Both, he says, will continue beefing up their luxury segments, ensuring continued earnings growth. **********STILL, there are risks. **********Luxury goods are a field strewn with egos, where shareholder value can take a back seat to personalities. The takeover of Fendi by LVMH and Prada hinged largely on the decision of Fendi's ready-to-wear designer, Karl Lagerfeld, who did not relish working for Tom Ford, Gucci's design genius. **********Mr. November of Hill Samuel Asset Management echoed other experts in cautioning that the price jumps made it tricky to pick winners. ''If you're getting in at that level,'' he said, ''be sure it's the right one.'' **********Morgan Stanley analysts give an outperform ranking to the Italian jeweler Bulgari, whose shares have returned nearly 40 percent over the last 12 months. **********And analysts cite two companies as potential takeover targets. In Austria, the luxury hosiery maker Wolford A.G. has seen its share price languish, even as its growth potential is generally believed to be strong. Shares in Stefanel, the Italian fashion retailer, gained only about 10 percent in the last year, despite rumors in September, later denied, that LVMH was preparing a bid. **********Predicting the takeover premiums that such potential targets can garner is difficult. But Morgan Stanley has calculated that over the past 13 years, prices have averaged 14.6 times earnings before taxes and interest; most recent deals have been higher. **********One uncertainty is whether the mergers will benefit shareholders. Ms. Maceira de Rosen of J. P. Morgan said she saw ''no huge synergies in the traditional sense'' resulting from the current wave of takeovers, though she remained enthusiastic about combinations like the Gucci-Yves Saint Laurent link. An acquisition by a multibrand giant with deep pockets, she said, can give a smaller company the needed capital for expansion. **********Domenico de Sole, Gucci's chief executive, pointed out that the very definition of a luxury brand ''tends to impose limits to its growth, if it wants to remain an exclusive brand.'' Thus, he said, a multitude of brands is required to guarantee revenue growth. **********In other words, expect more mergers."

They wondered whether the newly chosen President, Abdurrahman Wahid, and the 35 Cabinet ministers he just named had the expertise and cohesion needed to become efficient crisis managers. **********Worse, they fear that the Government, in its attempt to use unfamiliar democratic institutions to eradicate the corruption of its predecessor, may sacrifice economics in the name of popular justice. **********''Democracy is a desirable form of government, but it's not necessarily the most efficient form of government,'' said Ron Leven, a J. P. Morgan currency strategist in Singapore. **********Pervading such concern is a sense that despite encouraging moves toward stability and accountability, Indonesia's political process is both difficult to decipher and unpredictable. ''We're only certain about one thing: the economy's a mess,'' said William Belchere, head of fixed-income research and strategy at Merrill Lynch. **********With its banks and largest corporations still mired in delinquent debts, Indonesia remains dependent on emergency financing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But that help has been suspended until a banking scandal that helped undermine the previous administration is resolved. The scandal has virtually paralyzed the agency responsible for reworking those loans and resuscitating banks. **********And despite appeals by the new President that Indonesia needs foreign investors, many foreign financial specialists here seem dismayed that Mr. Wahid, a frail Muslim cleric, emerged as the country's leader. Noting the violent protests of the last 15 months, investors had concluded that the only political combination likely to put Indonesia on stable ground was for Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose party won the greatest share of votes in June's Parliament elections, to be chosen president and the former Defense Minister and armed forces chief, General Wiranto, to be named vice president. **********Some of these financial specialists said they were encouraged by Mr. Wahid's speech over the weekend, in which he said that ''foreign investment'' remained the two most important words for the economy. **********They also noted that the value of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, which is often seen as a barometer of investor sentiment, had risen against the dollar for much of the last month. Even so, caution prevailed. **********''I was impressed by Gus Dur's speech,'' said Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management, referring to Mr. Wahid by the nickname commonly used here. ''But a speech is one thing.'' **********Foremost among concerns is how quickly the Government can satisfy demands by the I.M.F. that those responsible for the banking scandal be brought to justice. The fund and other lenders have suspended a $43 billion aid package until the scandal, in which funds designated for bank restructuring were diverted to a company affiliated with Mr. Habibie's political party, is resolved. Indonesia's new Parliament has given two commissions the task of deciding whether to meet the I.M.F.'s demand that an audit of the scandal naming those involved be made public. **********Investors are also waiting to see how resolution of the scandal affects the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency. Officials at the agency approved the deal in question, and some political analysts predict that they and the agency's chairman, Glenn Yusuf, will be replaced. **********Doubts also surround Mr. Wahid's choice of economics minister, Kwik Kian Gie, a top aide to Ms. Megawati, who has in the past suggested that Indonesia adopt policies opposed by the I.M.F., including a change that would lock Indonesia's currency into a constant value against the dollar. Mr. Kwik said today that Indonesia would not adopt such a change."

He was released only when Mr. Luodeng bribed a police officer who, adding a final insult, warned the father not to let it happen again. **********''It was my fault he got arrested,'' Mr. Luodeng said later, shaking his head. ''I'm the one who taught him to be proud he is Tibetan.'' **********A ''patriotic education'' campaign recently began in this ethnically Tibetan area of Sichuan province, extending the pledges of allegiance that are common at state-run work places and schools elsewhere to those here, and even to Buddhist monasteries. The campaign is apparently being carried out with all the sensitivity of similar campaigns in other ethnic Tibetan areas, meaning relatively little. **********Of the 6 million ethnic Tibetans who live in areas under Chinese control, more than half live outside the official Tibetan Autonomous Region. They are in neighboring provinces that include large areas of the vast Tibetan plateau. **********In part because the authorities in Beijing are most concerned about damping demands for independence, China's official policy toward Tibetans and other ethnic minorities is a broad form of affirmative action, giving preferences in university admissions, in Government promotions and in relaxed population control. **********Yet that policy, in a remote Tibetan area like this one, seems more than outweighed by a brutal intolerance, religious oppression and widespread racism, many Tibetans say. **********International human rights monitors recognize that conditions for Tibetans are marginally better in areas like this one in the mountains of Sichuan province than they are in Tibet proper, where the authorities are nervous and strictly prevent any demonstration of opposition to Chinese rule. **********Yet if Chinese officials here are less oppressive than in Tibet, they still rule over ordinary people in an arbitrary way that extends all the way to young children, local Tibetans say, even if the toughest treatment is usually reserved for monks and anyone else who challenges local officials. They say Chinese officials treat Tibetans almost uniformly as inferior to Han Chinese. **********Tibetans take it for granted that they will have the worst jobs, that they will lose virtually any legal dispute with an ethnic Chinese no matter what the evidence and that they will suffer unexpected hardships throughout their lives. **********''We have no voice,'' said Mr. Luodeng, 51, a truck driver. ''We have no way of appeal, no one who will listen. We are a lost people.'' **********Officially, the Chinese authorities say they tolerate freedom of religious worship, though in practice that means little more than allowing temples and monasteries to remain open. At the monasteries sprinkled throughout the region, monks say, there are intense efforts to control their daily operations. **********Chinese officials still limit the number of monks in each monastery, tightly supervise the selection of religious leaders and strictly enforce the regulations that require monks to swear allegiance to the local Communist Party authorities. **********''We have no human rights here,'' complained a 27-year-old monk at the main temple in Garze, a town about 400 miles over dirt roads from the nearest city. **********In mid-June, two monks were arrested at the monastery in Garze and five others fled to elude police officials who were upset at a pamphlet that was being passed around in support of independence for Tibetans. **********Overwhelmingly, Tibetans here say, a primary goal in life is to see the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader, whose photograph is in plain view in countless homes, stores and temples in this area. Technically, such pictures are banned, and their display is a modest sign of tolerance by the authorities. No such pictures are on public view in Lhasa, Tibet's capital. **********Tibetans often talk about when the Dalai Lama will return to Tibet. **********''Last year, we said it would be this year,'' a shop owner in Garze said. ''This year, we say next year. We don't really know.'' **********With hopes of any return to Tibet by the Dalai Lama remaining dismal, a growing number of Tibetan monks from this area and others figure that if their religious leader cannot come home, they will go to him. So thousands are emigrating to India, where the Dalai Lama and a community of Tibetan refugees live in Dharamsala. **********The ability of Tibetans to get across the border to India appears to represent their growing ability to obtain passports from Chinese officials, many of whom request bribes for the favor. One monk in Garze who went to India and recently returned to visit his family said he had paid about $300 for a passport that should ordinarily cost about $30. **********This summer the World Bank came under fire for supporting a Government project to move 58,000 impoverished farmers -- about 40 percent ethnic Chinese and the balance Hui Muslim and other minorities -- from eastern Qinghai province to a newly irrigated area farther west in Qinghai that has traditionally been inhabited by Tibetans. Human rights groups argue that one of the main problems facing Tibetans is the arrival of so many Chinese, whom the Tibetans see as diluting native culture. **********In this Tibetan area, however, cultural dilution is not nearly as pressing an issue to people like Mr. Luodeng as simply being able to live without the wanton interference of corrupt, power-hungry officials. **********A 40-year-old tradesman in Garze complained that the Chinese authorities had burned down his house this year, for no apparent reason except that he is Tibetan. **********Outraged that local officials could behave this way, the tradesman said he had gone to the government of the neighboring county to seek redress. He said the official in charge had said: ''What race are you? Tibetan? Go ask the Dalai Lama for help.'' **********Mr. Luodeng has little affection for Chinese people, even though he married one. ''Only 1 out of 10 Chinese is decent,'' he said. ''The rest are bad, trying to figure out how to get money out of you.''"

""We expect those companies to survive and improve returns through a combination of cost-cutting and consolidation."" **********Liberalization is compelling the industry to manage itself better, to dispose of ancillary assets and to concentrate on generating greater amounts of cash, all of which improve the lot of shareholders, Mr. Taylor said. He predicted that the industry would emulate the U.S. airline business after it was deregulated a couple of decades ago; the result was relatively few players of consequence due to economies of scale and stiff barriers to entry. **********Among the companies for which Salomon has ""buy"" recommendations are VEBA AG of Germany and three from Britain โ Scottish Power PLC, National Power PLC and Scottish & Southern PLC. A lesser rating of ""outperform"" is assigned to Iberdrola SA of Spain, RWE AG of Germany and the French company Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux.

Lawyers on both sides called it the largest such verdict against a health maintenance organization. **********Aetna said it was confident that the damages would be overturned on appeal, as would a finding by the jury in San Bernardino County Superior Court last week awarding $4.5 million in actual damages in the 1995 death of David Goodrich, 44, a career local prosecutor. **********The previous record, an $89 million award in a similar case five years ago, was later settled for a small fraction of the original amount. **********Mr. Goodrich's case, which comes against a growing national backlash against the restrictive policies of H.M.O.'s, is unusual because most Americans are barred by a 1974 Federal law from suing their health insurer or H.M.O. for any damages except unpaid bills even if treatment they are entitled to is refused. The 1974 law does not even allow collection of legal fees. **********Mr. Goodrich's widow, Teresa, could sue because her husband was a Government employee not covered by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act. **********Mr. Goodrich collapsed in a courtroom in San Bernardino, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, in 1992. His doctors in Aetna Health Plans of California said that his illness was beyond their skills and referred him for treatment to doctors outside the H.M.O. **********Doctors at the City of Hope hospital in Duarte, Calif., recommended a bone-marrow transplant in October 1992 and the Aetna doctors agreed, said Mike Bidart, Teresa Goodrich's lawyer. **********''The standard for approval is 48 hours, but Aetna delayed for six months until the cancer spread to his liver and it was too late,'' Mr. Bidart said. **********David Simon, the chief legal officer of Aetna's managed care subsidiary, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, said last night that the H.M.O. had acted promptly at all times, ''but when the question of treatment was put to us, it was too late. It is unfortunate that attorney Goodrich had terminal cancer, but we did nothing to hasten his death.'' **********Elizabeth Goodrich, the deceased's sister, said last night that she was shocked by Mr. Simon's remarks. ''Aetna not only delayed, but they admitted in court that they did not meet their own standards for acting quickly,'' she said. **********Ms. Goodrich said that her brother died believing that his chances of survival, while not good, were lost because of Aetna's conduct. **********Mr. Bidart, of the Shernoff, Bidart, Darras & Arkin law firm in Claremont, Calif., said that Aetna had denied coverage on the grounds that the bone-marrow treatment was experimental and thus not covered, but that the insurance policy covering Mr. Goodrich had no such exclusion. **********Mr. Simon said that the judge refused to allow Aetna to present evidence showing that the treatment Mr. Goodrich and his doctors proposed was excluded. **********In January 1995, when Mr. Goodrich was near death, he underwent abdominal surgery at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif., to relieve his pain. The next day Aetna hand-delivered a letter denying payment for the surgery because it was done outside the H.M.O. network without advance approval. **********''Aetna's position was that if you are disloyal, your benefits are cut off,'' Mr. Bidart said. **********Mr. Simon said that the letter was required under California law and was not a sign of callousness by the H.M.O. **********He added that the jury was never told that Mr. Goodrich had a second insurance policy through his wife that covered his treatment. The $775,000 in medical bills have since been paid by the two insurers, another fact the jury was never told, Mr. Simon said. **********''This was an emotional verdict by an inflamed jury that we are confident will be overturned when all of the evidence is heard by dispassionate appellate judges,'' Mr. Simon said. **********Mr. Bidart had asked the jury to award about $32 million in punitive damages, roughly the value of Aetna's surplus in California above legally required reserves. Mr. Simon said the punitive damage award was six times the California H.M.O.'s net worth. **********The largest previous award against an H.M.O., for $89 million in April 1994, was returned by a jury in neighboring Riverside County, also for refusing bone-marrow treatment. The patient, Nelene Fox, died. Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a nonprofit H.M.O. watchdog group in Santa Monica, said the Goodrich verdict was a message to Congress as well as Aetna. **********''Court cases like this are rare because most Americans, 125 million of them, cannot under Federal law sue their H.M.O. for bad faith or denying treatment,'' he said. ''The jury was telling Congress to pay attention to denial of rights that kill patients.''"

And he is spending more money placing help-wanted ads than he is promoting the restaurant itself. **********The proportion of his total costs accounted for by labor has crept up to 29 percent from 24 percent during the last few years, and though he has clamped down on other expenses as much as possible, Mr. Ciotola said he has reached the point where customers at his restaurant, Da Vinci, will have to pick up some of the tab if wages keep rising rapidly. **********''It's just about as tight as it's going to get,'' Mr. Ciotola said. ''Any additional increases we face, we'll just have to pass along in terms of menu prices or I'm not going to make any money.'' **********The nation's low and still declining unemployment rate -- it fell to 4.1 percent in October, the lowest in almost 30 years -- has been great news for Mr. Ciotola's 75 employees and workers in most industries all over the country. **********But the shrinking pool of available labor, and the possibility that upward pressure on wages could spur inflation, seem to be the biggest issues on the minds of Federal Reserve officials as they debate whether to raise interest rates a third time this year when they meet on Tuesday. **********So far, employment cost increases have remained restrained despite the drop in unemployment. Moreover, to the degree that those costs have surged, from such hot industries as computer software and telecommunications to more traditional sectors like retailing, businesses have proved remarkably successful in absorbing them without sacrificing profits or raising prices. **********The reasons range from new trends in compensation, like the rising use of stock options in the place of salary increases, to an upturn in the growth rate of productivity, or each worker's output each hour. The question is how long such forces can keep a lid on the pressures that might force up wages and prices. **********Productivity improvements can continue, one Fed official said recently, ''but it defies all logic to assume you won't get increases in prices and wages at some point.'' **********Nobody knows precisely when that point will be reached, though, making the decision about whether to raise rates next week a particularly close call for the central bank, which pushed its benchmark Federal funds target rate up by a quarter of a percentage point in August, to 5.25 percent, after an earlier quarter-point increase in June. **********There is clearly a case for the Fed to take no action next week. By most measures, inflation remains reasonably well contained. The economy is showing some signs of slowing in response to earlier interest rate increases. Many stocks are down from their highs this summer. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other Fed officials are increasingly convinced that the improvement in productivity growth reflects structural changes in the way businesses operate, not just a brief cyclical upturn. **********''If they do raise rates, I'd really like to know why,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ''The only rationale is that growth is strong, and I think the Fed has moved beyond the idea that growth by itself is something to be afraid of.'' **********The case in favor of another rate increase next week is built largely on the idea that the nation is running out of workers, and that at some point a simple supply-and-demand situation will lead to a surge in wages and then, perhaps, prices. In this view, the Fed should stay ahead of the trend by slowing the economy a bit more to keep the labor market from getting even tighter. **********''Even in the absence of a rise in core inflation, developments in the labor market are likely to result in the Fed instituting more pre-emptive rate hikes,'' said Ian Morris, an economist at HSBC Securities in New York. **********In a report last month, John Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, took an in-depth look at the strains in the labor market. He said that even the broadest measure of available labor -- including not just people who are officially unemployed but some part-time workers and others who might be tempted back into the labor market -- had declined steeply, to 7 percent in September from 7.6 percent a year earlier. **********Joblessness among adults, 3.5 percent in October, is near a three-decade low. Overall labor force participation is stagnant or down, and the growth of the labor force is slowing somewhat. **********Mr. Youngdahl concluded that there appeared to be growing sentiment at the Fed that it is ''not only the small size but the inflexibility of the margin in labor supply that creates potential for an appreciable upward shift in labor expense growth.'' **********In his public appearances, Mr. Greenspan has alluded repeatedly to tight labor markets. Speaking to a group of business executives last month, Mr. Greenspan said that the number of people being drawn into the work force beyond those due to normal population trends -- in other words, people who had previously chosen not to work -- was accounting for roughly half a percentage point of economic growth. **********Eventually, Mr. Greenspan said, the economy would have to revert back to a growth rate reflecting normal labor force growth and the long-term rate of productivity gains. **********''Clearly, the growth in gross domestic product cannot exceed the sum of growth in structural productivity and in the working-age population indefinitely,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''Market pressures must eventually emerge that work to contain such unsustainable growth.'' **********There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of mounting pressures in the labor markets. Sears, Roebuck & Company said that in some cities it had to pay cash bonuses to attract and even retain employees in its stores and that regional managers had discretion to raise wages if needed. **********James H. Keyes, chairman of Johnson Controls, a manufacturer based in Milwaukee, said his company now often drew new employees from lower-paying, less-skilled jobs in the service sector, and must spend money and time training them. Moreover, Johnson's customers in industries like automobiles demand decreasing prices on some of its products, putting additional pressure on the company to offset rising labor costs with productivity improvements. **********And at the loftiest reaches of the employment scale, experienced executives going into senior jobs at technology start-ups are able to demand and get richer packages of stock and options in addition to cash compensation. **********''We're living in the middle of an unprecedented supply-and-demand imbalance,'' said David B. Kixmiller, a partner in the Silicon Valley office of Heidrick & Struggles, the executive search firm. **********To hold down labor costs in that kind of environment, companies have become more imaginative. Some use one-time cash bonuses to reward workers without permanently raising wage rates. Others are offering more equity-based pay programs like stock options that do not show up in traditional measures of wage and salary growth. Others are offering expensive gifts, extra time off and other benefits in an effort to lure new employees and hold onto the ones they have. **********Some analysts also think that workers themselves are less aggressive in pushing for pay increases than they were in previous business cycles when unemployment dipped to low levels. The reason, they speculate, is that the combination of global competition and the relentless corporate push to cut costs hasleft workers somewhat insecure about their jobs -- even if they are relatively confident that they could find another if they did become unemployed. **********The pressure on labor costs could well ease if the economy is indeed slowing. But the economy has repeatedly defied projections of a slowdown, and at this point continued strong growth could send unemployment down to levels the nation has not seen since 1969. **********Mr. Morris of HSBC calculated recently that if labor force growth remains at its current annual rate of roughly 1 percent, labor force participation remains steady at around 67 percent and the economy creates an average of 250,000 nonfarm jobs a month, the unemployment rate will decline to as low as 3.5 percent by the middle of next year. **********If job growth averages 200,000 a month -- it has been running at an average of 192,000 a month this year -- it would push the unemployment rate down to as low as 3.9 percent by mid-2000, Mr. Morris said. **********Fed officials will no doubt scrutinize new reports on retail sales and productivity that are to be released on Friday, the last major economic indicators before their meeting next Tuesday. And while they have given few clues in the last few weeks as to their thinking about the arguments for and against a rate increase, they have made clear that they are very much on alert. **********''One should not assume that the business cycle is dead,'' William McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, told reporters in Vienna today after delivering a speech there. ''One should not assume that the American economy can keep growing faster without inflation.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/19/business/technology-privacy-on-internet-poses-legal-puzzle.html,Steve Lohr,1999-04-19,Privacy on Internet is subject of discussion and debate at conference marking 35th anniversary of founding of Laboratory for Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; discussion focuses on some of broadest social and legal issues ...,1038,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Privacy on Internet Poses Legal Puzzle,TECHNOLOGY; Privacy on Internet Poses Legal Puzzle," **********Each time a revolutionary new technology has arrived, the governments of the day have been leery of its capacity for mischief and criminality. Centuries ago, there were calls for giving the authorities the power of prior restraint lest the printing press become an instrument of sedition and slander. Later, there were qualms about selling automobiles to the public because crooks could use them to escape the police. **********As the designated representative of this rich and checkered tradition, Philip Reitinger, a prosecutor for the Justice Department, knew he faced a tough crowd last Tuesday in Cambridge, Mass. **********He was speaking at a conference to mark the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a gathering of technology's true believers. **********Mr. Reitinger, square-jawed and pin-striped, opened with a bit of dry humor, laced with sarcasm. ''It may come as a shock to many of you, but people commit crimes on the Internet,'' he said. **********So began a spirited discussion and debate on a seemingly narrow subject, ''Should the Laboratory for Computer Science Anonymous Remailer Be Shut Down?'' But the discussion focused on some of the broadest social and legal issues involving the Internet: identity, privacy, anonymity and free speech. **********Mr. Reitinger's opposite number on the panel was Nadine Strossen, a professor at the New York Law School and president of the American Civil Liberties Union. They were joined by Frans Kaashoek, an associate professor at M.I.T., who has been in charge of the anonymous remailer since it began operating in 1996. **********An anonymous remailer, a type of data-network relay, is essentially a technological buffer, offering confidentiality to its users. **********It can be used to mask the origin of a piece of E-mail or the computer from which a person is browsing the World Wide Web. It does this by stripping off the identifying information on an E-mail, for example, and substituting an anonymous code number or term. **********Sophisticated remailers, like the one at M.I.T., also route messages through many different relay computers around the world, leaving no record of the path an anonymous message traveled after leaving the remailer. **********But computer experts have occasionally tracked messages from remailers, either because a person used an anonymity service incorrectly or because of security flaws in a remailer. **********There are about 40 anonymous remail services worldwide. They are used by, among others, dissidents and human rights representatives in nations with repressive governments, whistle-blowers in companies or government agencies, minority groups fearing discrimination and people simply wishing to avoid the bulk E-mail advertising that marketers increasingly send over the Net. **********In Kosovo, some people with on-line connections have started using anonymous remail services to try to maintain confidential communications and avoid detection by the Serbian military. **********But anonymous remail services, Federal prosecutors say, are also used by child pornographers, extortionists, software pirates and drug dealers. **********Though not illegal, remailers are often viewed with suspicion by law enforcement agencies. They occupy a gray area in cyberspace, and Mr. Kaashoek good-naturedly underscored that fact by wearing a black ski mask for much of the panel discussion. After his opening, Mr. Reitinger turned to his theme. **********''Anonymity has a down side to it,'' he said. ''It's hard to put a pseudonym in jail. There are not a lot of indictments that say, United States of America versus John Doe. If people are truly anonymous, there can be no law enforcement.'' **********Mr. Reitinger and Ms. Strossen have debated these issues in the past, so their early exchanges had the practiced rhythms of old sparring partners. **********Her opening salvo: ''We've got to make sure that freedom of speech, freedom of the press and privacy are as protected in cyberspace as they are in the rest of life. Certain individual rights cannot be sacrificed because of the panic and fears of abuse of a new technology, or because it creates problems for law enforcement.'' **********Mr. Reitinger, a senior counsel in the Justice Department's computer crime and intellectual property division, agreed that the Internet had made his life more difficult. Trying to trace a path of criminal communications often involves working with authorities in 8 to 20 nations, he observed. **********Anonymous remailers can make that tracing far more difficult, if not impossible. Mr. Kaashoek said M.I.T. had received several subpoenas from state and Federal authorities since the university's remailer was set up in 1996. M.I.T., he said, has answered the subpoenas but he noted that typically the tracking information it can offer involves only one leg of a many-legged path of communication. ''If a person is using our system correctly,'' Mr. Kaashoek said, ''law enforcement isn't going to find that information very useful.'' **********As a medium, the Internet does seem unique in the way that it magnifies the issues of privacy and anonymity. ''The problem is that this technology is just so darned powerful,'' said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future. ''It makes it easy to be anonymous, but it can also make it far easier to track people down and invade their privacy.'' **********Mr. Saffo did not attend the debate, but both Ms. Strossen and Mr. Reitinger addressed the point that Internet technology has raised the stakes on matters of privacy. Both agreed that the technology poses difficult challenges, though they approached the subject from understandably different vantage points. **********Ms. Strossen said she was ''very concerned'' that new software technology allows corporations or governments to track a person's every mouse click and to assemble vast digital dossiers on individuals. ''It can include all your personal financial transactions and your medical records,'' she observed. ''I don't think our laws adequately protect individual privacy anymore. The technologies of anonymity and cryptography may be the only way to protect privacy.'' **********To which Mr. Reitinger replied: ''I think we are perilously close to a lose-lose situation in which citizens have lost their privacy to commercial interests and criminals have easy access to absolute anonymity. That's not a world we want.'' **********There was scattered clapping for various remarks made during the debate, but that comment from Mr. Reitinger was greeted with sustained applause. Sophisticated criminals, of course, will always have access to the latest technology, whether cars or software. Nodding to that reality, Mr. Reitinger told the audience of computer scientists, ''I'm just asking that you help law enforcement to capture the stupid criminals.''"

Others fled in terror both of the Serbs and the NATO bombs that rained down on Yugoslavia for 78 days. More than one million of the 1.8 million Albanians in Kosovo before the war have been uprooted in the last 11 weeks. More than 900,000 crossed the borders, and an estimated 500,000 more have been hiding in the woods and mountains, with little food, medicine or shelter. **********The NATO peacekeepers, their generals say, intend to reverse all that and complete the daunting task of bringing the refugees back home. Much of the landscape is destroyed, buildings are burned, crops unplanted and farm animals foraging on their own. The killing and looting of the last 11 weeks will doubtless have inflamed the deep-seated mistrust between Serbs and Albanians, who had lived for the last decade under tough police rule from Belgrade and whose armed guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, have waged an increasingly violent struggle against the Serbian security forces for the last 15 months. **********Today, Kosovo's Serbs were downcast and bitter, taking some pleasure only in the unexpected, confusing appearance of Russian troops in Pristina as an as yet self-styled element of the peacekeeping force. Late tonight, there were many bursts of automatic weapons fire in Pristina, Kosovo's darkened capital. **********The lead elements on the move today were British, spearheaded by paratroopers and Ghurka troops of the Fifth Airborne Brigade and followed by the tanks and other heavy equipment of the Fourth Armored Corps. They are to be followed by French, Italian, German and American soldiers who will control various zones throughout Kosovo. **********As the sky began to lighten around 4 A.M. today, a senior British officer attached to the paratroops checked his watch outside a headquarters tent set up in the parking lot of the Europa 93 cafe a little back from the border crossing. Yes, he nodded, everything should be moving on schedule. **********From a wheat field, eight Chinook and six Puma helicopters, with six American Apaches flying cover, had lifted a force of paratroopers to secure the hills around Kacanik, overlooking the highway. **********Long lines of troop carriers and other vehicles already stretched along the road leading to the border crossing. At 5:25, Brig. Adrian Freer, commanding the ground convoy, strode smartly back from another meeting with Yugoslav Army officers and swung into the lead Land-Rover. The convoy moved over the border into Djeneral Jankovic, an industrial and railroad terminal town on the Kosovo side of the border with Macedonia. **********The most striking feature of the route the convoy traveled -- all the way up to its greeting at Lugagji, less than 16 miles south of Pristina -- was the utter emptiness of the landscape. **********Aside from the military bustle filling the road, there was not a single human being to be seen in a landscape of shops with broken windows and burned and destroyed houses. In Djeneral Jankovoc, soldiers manned the empty street corners. All along the way, the convoy dropped off troops and armored vehicles, the soldiers sheltering under hastily rigged ponchos, and staring out over their weapons at countryside where nothing was moving except a few stray dogs and a cow grazing beside an abandoned cement block factory."

The number of multiple-PC homes is expected to double in the next few years, the importance of the Internet for communications and commerce is expected to soar, and home networks are suddenly a practical necessity for many people, not just a project for electronic tinkerers. **********Large businesses typically attack the problem of networks by hiring full-time administrators to worry about wiring topologies and network protocols, but in households where even programming the VCR or getting Junior to take out the trash is an ordeal, hiring a network specialist is out of the question. **********Yet industry analysts say we are rapidly approaching the day when a much broader array of home devices will be sharing data, not just PC's and peripherals, but also television sets, stereo systems, smart land-line telephones, cellular phones, digital cameras and even kitchen appliances. A consumer might download music from the Internet through a computer and play it on a home stereo, for example, or play a DVD movie on the home-office computer but watch it on the big television set in the living room. **********In the home of the near future, if all goes as planned, someone might simply point a digital video camera at the television and the two devices would instantly recognize each other. A signal sent from the computer in the car could arm the home security system or turn down the thermostat. A computer in the master bedroom could display images beamed from the camera in the nursery or over the front door. **********In some of the more imaginative scenarios, the refrigerator could know it was low on milk and eggs and place an order with the local supermarket, and a microwave oven could check a database that listed the allergies or eating habits of family members and issue an alert if an unwanted ingredient was detected when a package's bar code was waved in front of it. All the clocks in the house would set themselves by linking to the PC in the den, which would set its own internal clock via the Internet, checking with an atomic clock in Colorado. **********The technology to create all such fancy networks exists today. But to many consumers, it may seem like a complex solution in search of a simple problem. **********Right now, according to surveys done by computer network companies, the main reason to build a home network is to share Internet access, whether through a conventional dial-up modem or, increasingly, through a high-speed cable or digital subscriber line (D.S.L.) modem. A network enables two or more computers to share the high-speed connection at the same time, so family members don't have to take turns. **********Setting up a network, at a typical cost of $50 to $100 for each connected computer, is often cheaper than buying a modem for each PC and getting a second or third phone line from the phone company. **********And once the household signs up for high-speed cable or D.S.L. access -- typically at a cost of $40 to $60 a month for the line, plus equipment and installation fees, plus additional monthly fees of $20 or more for the Internet service provider (unless the cable provider is also the I.S.P.) -- it is often cheaper to add a new PC to a network than it is to set up a separate high-speed connection for a new PC. **********The second most common reason to build a network, the surveys found, is to enable two or more family members to play multiplayer games together. **********Playing against the computer is increasingly passe; racing against Dad in a Formula One race or teaming up with little sister in a dogfight is the future of PC games. And playing games, by the way, is the second-fastest-growing use of home computers, after surfing the Internet. **********The traditional reasons for having a computer network in the office -- the need to share printers, files and applications -- are farther down the list for PC users at home. **********Home networks will become much more interesting and complex in the next few years with the growing deployment of new digital devices like television set-top boxes, smart telephones and wireless Web pads that connect to the Internet via radio waves. The trend is expected to accelerate as consumers begin buying digital entertainment, like music, videos and books, over the Net and downloading on one device -- probably a powerful PC acting as the household's Internet gateway -- then transferring the files to another device that can handle them better. That device might be a stereo with a better speaker system, a television with a larger screen or some sort of specialized digital device, like an electronic book that can be carried to the comfy couch in the living room. **********But not yet. Despite the recent arrival of a number of different home network kits that promise to simplify the task, setting up the connections isn't that much easier than it was when only hobbyists were doing it. **********The conventional way to build a PC network in offices, using a technology called Ethernet, is also popular in homes where PC users demand high-speed connections (10 million to 100 million bits per second) and have the technical determination to make Ethernet work. The most popular Ethernet kit for home networks, which involves stringing wires, is Linksys's Homelink, which connects two PC's for about $100. **********Although Ethernet has snaked into many homes, most consumers are not keen on do-it-yourself projects that involve boring holes in walls, stringing wires along the floor with duct tape or paying hundreds of dollars for custom installations. **********But under the battle cry of ''no new wires,'' more than a dozen companies have come up with alternatives that connect PC's over the phone wiring a house already has. **********I've tried several of these, including the Intel Corporation's Anypoint Home Network kit ($189); a variation from Farallon Communications called Homeline ($139 to connect two computers), for the several million houses where Windows PC's and Apple Macintoshes co-exist, and one called Homefree from Diamond Multimedia Systems ($100). **********Unlike Ethernet systems, these new home network kits that connect through phone lines are intended to appeal to consumers who love the Internet but don't necessarily like computers. **********The kits are relatively easy to install and configure. The current phone line standard allows connection speeds of one million bits per second, much slower than Ethernet, but second-generation versions of the kits scheduled to arrive this fall are expected have a data transfer speed that is 10 times as fast. **********All of these kits use the home's existing telephone wiring to share data without interrupting normal phone service or high-speed D.S.L. Internet service. The computers share the same wires as the phones but operate at a different frequency that does not interfere with voice traffic. You need a phone jack near each computer, and users who have multiple phone lines must make sure that all the wall jacks in the network have the same phone number. **********Despite promises of simplicity, however, the phone line products have been known to cause even experienced network users to have conniptions. Computers are complex things, and getting them all to work in harmony is tricky. Sometimes the network stops working for no apparent reason: printers can stop printing, and laptop computers brought home from the office can cause configuration confusion. That's when cryptic error messages can make even the most patient person reach for the aspirin bottle. **********''There are definitely some kinks that need to be ironed out,'' said Michael Wolf, an industry analyst with the Cahners In-Stat Group of Phoenix, who noted that these first-generation network kits were still too hard for average consumers to use. ''When you get beyond the techno-geeks, you have some problems.'' **********Not all computers are hostile in network environments. Network connectors and file-sharing software are standard equipment on Apple Macintosh computers, which makes home networks easy as long as all the computers are Macs. But 9 out of 10 computers sold today are not as network-friendly as the Macintosh. **********Companies like Intel and Microsoft, whose technologies form the basis of the most common home PC's today, acknowledge that home networks could be made simpler. They say they are working on next-generation products that will simplify the setup process and make home networks more reliable and easier to use. **********Microsoft, for example, plans to emphasize ''universal plug and play'' capabilities in its next version of Windows for consumers, and it is working with the 3Com Corporation to create a series of home network kits that will go on sale later this year. Compaq, the world's largest PC maker, plans to make home network technology a standard feature in its consumer PC's. **********Meanwhile, nearly every major PC maker, and many of the largest consumer electronics companies, have joined one or more working groups that are trying to establish common standards for networks that connect through phone lines, radio waves, infrared signals, home power lines and a variety of special wires. **********Mr. Wolf, of Cahners In-Stat, said he expected home phone-line systems to be the most common solution for home networks in the next few years, followed by wireless systems and systems that connect through electrical outlets. **********Networks that connect through a home's electrical wiring have appeal in residences where phone jacks may be scarce. They connect PC's to regular 110-volt wall outlets. One such kit is the $199 Intelogis Passport network. But power lines are finicky, and interference from refrigerator and air-conditioner power spikes can degrade the network's performance. Data moves at less than half the speed of the basic home phone line alternatives. **********A more appealing solution, especially for people who use portable computers and handheld information devices, is to bypass wires altogether by connecting devices with radio waves. **********Wireless network kits like Proxim's Symphony (which costs $199 for each laptop and $149 for each desktop) offer data transmission speeds that are comparable to the speeds of current phone-line systems, but wireless systems invariably cost much more than wired systems. **********A company called Sharewave has created wireless network technology that connects PC's and other devices at Ethernet speeds. Computer and consumer electronics products based on Sharewave technologies are expected to be in stores next year. Motorola has been demonstrating a wireless home-network hub that is expected to be on sale later this year. **********These are all solutions for retrofitting homes and apartments with computer network equipment. The ultimate and most expensive approach to building a home network is to buy a new house that has high-speed wiring already built into the walls. **********Many new subdivisions are being built with such wiring as a standard feature, and some analysts expect computer networks to be as common in new homes in the 21st century as plumbing and electricity. ''We expect that in a few years, almost all new construction will include network cabling,'' said Michael Kwatinetz, a market analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. **********Two new subdivisions in Houston, each with nearly 2,000 homes, have been built with I.B.M. Home Director network hubs built into closets or garages. **********At DC Ranch, a development outside of Scottsdale, Ariz., each of the 8,000 houses that have been built or are planned has high-speed connections in the walls. **********And each home is linked to the others and the world on a fiber-optic network that provides data services, digital television and digital phone service. A new development of 50,000 homes near Las Vegas, Nev., is to be built with internal networks as a standard amenity. **********Eventually, the most optimistic forecasters say, Internet access will be nearly as common as phone access in houses."

You know, kaboom. No copy of the broadcast, whose history was reported in Time magazine in 1992, has turned up. If you should find a copy, close the curtains, stay away from the windows and do not look toward the flash of light. Instead, get in touch with Conelrad (www.conelrad .com). **********The Arthur Godfrey public service announcement is No. 1 on the hit parade of requests by Conelrad's creators for submissions to their fledgling site, which promises an overview and a thrillingly creepy look at America's postwar atomic culture. ''It will be a permanent and definitive reminder of how pop culture and the cold war intersected,'' Bill Geerhart, Conelrad's editor, wrote by E-mail. **********Conelrad, as a baby boomer will be happy to tell you, was the Government's acronym for what became the Emergency Broadcast System, at 640 and 1240 AM on the radio. Short for Control of Electromagnetic Radiation, it existed from 1951 to 1963 as a way of shifting the broadcast frequencies of AM stations to prevent enemy aircraft from homing in on radio signals for navigation. In the event of a nuclear attack, those frequencies were where Arthur Godfrey's message and all other Government emergency instructions were to have been broadcast. **********This Conelrad Web site -- and remember, this is only a test -- pledges to be short on polemics (there are no discussions of Communists in the State Department) and long on films, records, television and literature. **********Polemics are hardly needed. The official Government advice speaks for itself, thunderingly obvious and laughably useless. (''Any shadow will offer protection from searing flash.'') Equally interesting are the 45-r.p.m. singles titles, like ''Uranium Fever'' (mid-50's) by Elton Britt, who called himself the world's highest yodeler, and ''Atomic Cocktail'' (1945) by Slim Gaillard. **********For a much more sobering look at the cold war's real atomic victims, the site has a link to the National Association of Atomic Veterans (www.naav.com), which puts out a quarterly newsletter about the soldiers who took part in radioactive-weapons tests and their efforts to get Government assistance. (And for more on Communist espionage, try the National Security Agency's files on the Venona project, which decoded Soviet messages to their American spymasters: www.nsa.gov:8080 /docs/venona/index.html. **********Conelrad's television section has summaries of Rod Serling's still powerful atomic-nightmare episodes from ''Twilight Zone,'' which might be expected. But it also has an offbeat twist on ''I Dream of Jeannie,'' ''Bewitched'' and ''Mr. Ed'' as responses to nuclear brinkmanship (the genie is out of the bottle, we have unleashed special powers, and don't get us started about mutants). **********''The Munsters and the Addamses were the post-nuclear monsters who literally moved in next door to the Cleavers,'' Mr. Geerhart wrote in an introduction to the television section. **********The movie section offers a close look at American International's ''Panic in Year Zero'' (1962), directed by Ray Milland. He also stars as a father who responsibly turns the car radio to Conelrad (the real one) as soon as he sees a mushroom cloud over Los Angeles. Viewers with Real Video can listen to Les Baxter's crashing jazz score. **********Mr. Geerhart said the Conelrad site was founded this year by three Los Angeles friends in their mid-30's and 40's: Mr. Geerhart, who works for Citigroup; Curtis Samson, a retired Air Force captain, and Ken Sitz, who works for Buena Vista's Internet division. **********''We are people who were born into the cold war and continue to be intrigued by the emerging details of this intense 'cool' conflict,'' Mr. Geerhart wrote. **********''There isn't a particular political agenda to the site. Our main goal is to present an entertaining nonfiction site and generate discussion on our message boards.'' **********Mr. Geerhart promises that Conelrad will soon feature Five-Star Fallout Shelter, his first-person account of a tour through the former Congressional relocation center that was secretly located under the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va., for 30 years."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/23/world/crisis-balkans-bombing-nato-mistakenly-hits-rebel-base-kosovo-killing-7.html,Michael Gordon,1999-05-23,NATO aircraft bomb a key base held by Kosovo Liberation Army in Kosare under mistaken assumption that it is still held by Yugoslav forces; KLA says 7 fighters were killed and 25 wounded in attack; photo of bombed power plant in Belgrade (M),735,,The New York Times,World,News,article,"NATO Mistakenly Hits Rebel Base in Kosovo, Killing 7","CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE BOMBING; NATO Mistakenly Hits Rebel Base in Kosovo, Killing 7"," **********NATO aircraft mistakenly bombed a key base that had been seized by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army six weeks ago, allied spokesman said today. **********Rebel fighters use the base to funnel supplies and troops deep inside Kosovo. It is situated at Kosare, a mountain town in Kosovo about six miles from the Albanian border. **********But NATO did not know that the base was under the control of the Kosovo Liberation Army, even though it has often been featured in reports by the international press, including television broadcasts and still photographs. **********''The target which was struck by NATO was done so on the assumption that it was still in the hands of the Yugoslav Army,'' said Jamie P. Shea, the NATO spokesman. ''And subsequently it appears to have been taken over by the K.L.A.'' **********The Kosovo Liberation Army said 7 fighters had been killed and 25 wounded in the attack, which took place on Friday morning. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has monitors in the region, said at least one rebel fighter had been killed and 15 wounded. **********The bombing of Kosare was the latest in a series of intelligence errors that have embarrassed allied war planners. The mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, the result of bad intelligence work by the Central Intelligence Agency, sparked angry protests in Beijing. **********More controversy over NATO's targeting flared on Friday when Belgrade charged that NATO had bombed a prison near Istok. Serbian officials said 19 inmates and guards, including Kosovo Albanians, had been killed in the raid. **********NATO spokesmen said today that 20 allied planes had targeted a major military command post and staging area near the prison. They said the alliance had not intended to hit the prison and was still not certain that it had done so. Allied officers are still examining video tapes from the strike planes. **********The prison has been cited in international reports on human rights abuses as a Serbian police center for the torture and interrogation of rebels and other Kosovo Albanians deemed dissidents by the authorities. NATO spokesmen acknowledged that allied planners had assumed that the prison was empty at the time it was struck. **********The errors have occurred as NATO has stepped up its aircraft raids and reported notable success. On Friday, the alliance flew 648 missions, of which 245 were bombing attacks. **********NATO said it had stuck at least 12 tanks, 11 armored vehicles, 9 artillery positions and at least 7 other vehicles. It also hit electrical transformers, among other targets. **********The Friday attack on Kosare threw a spotlight on the relationship between NATO and the Kosovo Liberation Army. Officially, they do not fight together. But military officials say rebel troops in Kosovo often provide information on Serbian positions, which enables NATO to bomb them. **********Allied spokesman have also cited the rebels' persistence in the field, as an indication that the Yugoslav military is weakening. Allied intelligence officials estimate that there are between 6,000 and 10,000 rebel fighters in Kosovo and approximately an equal number in camps in Albania. **********They are lightly armed with rifles and anti-tank weapons, but can still have the ability to harass Serbian forces. **********Because the rebels want NATO to keep bombing, it has not complained publicly about the attack at its Kosare base. NATO did not volunteer any information on the strike either until questioned about the incident at its press briefing today. **********Even so, NATO's information was sketchy. Mr. Shea did not explain how the Kosare base, which has been in rebel hands for more than a month, became a NATO target. **********He described it as a ''a border command post that was until very recently in the hands of the Yugoslav Army.'' **********''If we had known, in a very dynamic situation -- particularly where the K.L.A. is extremely active in that part -- that it had been captured by the K.L.A. then it would have been taken off the target list,'' Mr. Shea said. **********NATO warplanes have often bombed Serbian border posts, which the alliance says the Serbs have sometimes used to hide ammunition and fuel. **********The border posts are relatively easy to attack, particularly when bad weather or target identification problems have prevented allied planes from hitting more difficult targets, like Serbian troops and armor. **********Additionally, the Kosovo-Albania border has been the scene of intense fighting. The rebels have been infiltrating men and materiel through seven mountain bases, and the Serbs have been trying to seal the border."

But how can something as ephemeral as inspiration be systematically created and nurtured in an organized, deadline-driven business environment? **********One of the answers at Ideo Product Design, a company based in Palo Alto, Calif., is the Tech Box, a library that catalogues some 200 weird physical materials and odd objects, ranging from rubber balls to pieces of space shuttle tile, for inspiration-seeking engineers to play with. **********Ideo, a design consulting firm, has engineered everything from the gummy-toothpaste-resistant cap for Crest's Neat Squeeze toothpaste tube to the entire body of the handheld Audible Mobile Player, a new device that downloads recorded books from the Internet. Since it was founded as David Kelley Design in 1978, Ideo has completed approximately 3,000 projects, including collaborating with Apple Computer to create the first commercial mouse and some of the first laptops and assisting in the design of a virtual-reality headset for Sega. One of Ideo's recent projects involved the user interface for an easy-to-use portable defibrillator from Heartstream Inc. **********With the Tech Box, the company has catalogued and electronically documented materials, objects and gadgets. There are six boxes all told in the company's six major offices -- in San Francisco; Palo Alto; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Chicago; Boston, and London -- and one that the company has sold to an office furnishings client, Steelcase Inc. in Grand Rapids. **********Each box has five drawers holding 200-odd objects, which are tagged and numbered. There are related Web sites on a company intranet; access to the intranet is gained through an iMac that sits on top of a file cabinet. Only Ideo employees (and Steelcase employees, for their box) have full access to the boxes and intranet information; Ideo staff members can walk other clients through the box for brainstorming sessions. **********Engineers rummage through the compartments and play with the items, which include tiny batteries, miniature switches and the kind of heat-sensitive thermochromatic material that makes mood rings intuitive, in quests for inspiration. They might be seeking the right ''click'' for an electronic book's buttons or a microprocessor cooling mechanism. **********''It's the Montessori approach,'' said Dennis Boyle, a senior engineer at Ideo who has taught product design classes at nearby Stanford University for 15 years. ''The whole idea is to go through and just experience these things.'' **********As Mr. Boyle explored the drawers' compartments, he picked up various things. ''Here's an electroluminescent display -- you find it in portable computers and pagers and watches and night lights,'' he said. ''See how light and flexible it is?'' **********He handled a piece of Kevlar, the material used in bulletproof vests, then a sheet of shiny gold-colored Mylar, the insulation material used in space satellites. A clear gelatinous material in a small plastic container grabbed Mr. Boyle's attention next. He said it was called Aerogel and explained: ''It's really only four times as dense as air. It crumbles quickly, and it's somewhat of a hazard, so we don't let people fool around with it. But in space it's turned out to be an extremely efficient insulator. It's so light, it feels like you're holding a piece of smoke.'' **********Christine Kurjan, an Ideo design engineer who acts as the Tech Box's curator, added:  ''If you had a piece the size of your body, it would only weigh a pound but it would support a car. I've read about it being, in 20 years, usable for windows.'' **********Mr. Boyle said the Tech Box (and its precursor, a cardboard box of stuff owned by Mr. Boyle) has been a way of collecting information over the years ''so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you come up with a new idea.'' **********Matt Herron, formerly of Apple and currently vice president for product development at Softbook Press, has worked with Mr. Boyle for several years on various projects. In a recent project, the Tech Box helped Softbook, an electronic book company based in Menlo Park, Calif., find the right click for its electronic book buttons. **********''For years,'' Mr. Boyle said, ''there had been a tech collection in boxes that we'd more or less just dump out on the table for brainstorming or student talks. It was less formal.'' **********Mr. Herron, who also worked for an Ideo competitor called Frogdesign, based in Silicon Valley, said of this kind of object catalogue, ''Dennis is the only one I know who's applied it to high technology.'' **********Demonstrating the actual workings of the Tech Box, Ms. Kurjan pointed to the intranet page displayed on the dimly glowing iMac while Mr. Boyle pulled open the drawers. ''Each one of these items has a page in here,'' Ms. Kurjan said. ''What it is, what it's made of, how it works.'' The pages also list manufacturers and who, if anyone, in the company has used the material in a project. **********Mr. Kelley pointed to a ''phase-change chemical hand-warmer,'' a packet that is put in ski boots or mittens to release heat. ''We've not applied this one yet,'' Mr. Kelley said, ''but my favorite concept for this one is the 'plate in the restaurant.' '' Mr. Kelley would like to embed the phase-change chemical warmer inside the plate to keep it hot. Because boiling cools the phase-changing chemical warmer, the dishwasher should return the hot plate to normal, theorized Mr. Kelley, who pointed out that he was not an engineer. **********The transformation of the Tech Box from a handful of favorite gadgets on each engineer's desk to a catalogued and curated collection has had people vying to come up with things that would be worthy of it. Drawing on the work of a Stanford professor of organizational behavior, Bob Sutton, who is writing a book based on an 18-month study of Ideo, Mr. Kelley said getting something included in the box might even be seen as raising someone's status. **********Mr. Kelley said he had recently risen in status when a discovery of his had been deemed worthy of the Tech Box. ''It's a Pack-A-Ccino -- a cappuccino with its own heat source, so when you're on the ski slopes you can still have a hot cappuccino,'' he said. ''I suspect it's really, really bad-tasting, but the technology is there, it works.'' **********Mr. Boyle countered that at a staff meeting where the coffee had been sampled, the consensus had been that it ''wasn't as bad as we expected.'' Mr. Boyle paused and added, ''Maybe we could use that for a piece of sports equipment, or medical equipment, and have it be very portable.'' **********''It's a mental tool box,'' he added, glancing at the Tech Box, ''a whole bunch of neat, possibly useful ideas.''"

The selling was touched off by growing fears that rising yields in Japan will attract investors away from the American market. **********The surge in interest rates also helped push stock prices lower. Higher interest rates can lure investors away from stocks and cause those who stay there to worry more about the high price of equities. So with investors already worrying if the sharp run-up in stocks since last October can continue with the slower earnings growth of the last two quarters, yesterday's interest rate surge made the market's outlook worse. **********''There was a major shock in the bond market and stocks don't usually ignore that,'' said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''When you get to 20 percent overvalued, you usually get into trouble,'' he said of the stock market, adding that his overvaluation measure was now nearing 18 percent. **********In the bond market, which closed early ahead of the Presidents' Day holiday Monday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 5.42 percent, its highest since Aug. 26, from the 5.30 percent yield of the new 30-year bond auctioned Thursday. **********But more important for investors than the absolute level of interest rates was that the yield on the 30-year bond and other Treasury securities broke through the top of a trading range that had lasted since Nov. 6, when the yield on the 30-year bond was 5.39 percent. **********With more and more signs that the economy is not slowing down as forecast by many economists, ''you can't rule out yields going higher,'' said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, global chief economist at Salomon Smith Barney. And, he said, ''the higher yields go, the more they highlight the vulnerability of the equity market.'' **********On Wall street, stocks gave up most of the gains they had made on Thursday when the Nasdaq index leaped 96 points in its biggest one-day point gain ever. Technology stocks were the culprits again, as Dell Computer, down 12, to 89 7/8; Microsoft, off 5, to 157 3/4; Intel, down 6 3/4, to 126 1/2, and Cisco Systems, off 5 13/16 , to 99 1/16 , helped lead the broader market lower. Earnings concerns undermined Dell's price as an analyst from BancBoston Robertson Stephens said Dell's fourth-quarter sales would slow sharply. Dell is to report earnings next week. **********Internet stocks also took a beating, led by Excite, Realnetworks and At Home. In the first six trading days of this year, Internet stocks, as measured by The Street.com's Net index, jumped 44.7 percent. Since then, the sector has lost 17.9 percent. **********Stocks of smaller companies have also suffered recently, after a strong rally since last fall. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks rose 40 percent from early October to the second week in January. But since then, the index has fallen 8 percent. And the Russell index is the only one of the four majors that has not surpassed its 1998 high. **********Yesterday, the Nasdaq index fell 83.66 points, or 3.5 percent, to 2,321.89, and is off 2.2 percent this week. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, which is light on technology stocks, fell 88.57 points, or 1 percent, to 9,274.89. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which includes some of the big-name technology stocks, dropped 23.91, or 1.9 percent, to 1,230.13. The Russell index fell 7.72 points, or 1.9 percent, to 398.44. For the week, the Dow was off three-tenths of 1 percent, the S.& P. 500 seven-tenths of 1 percent and the Russell 3.5 percent. **********The Dow and the S.& P. 500 have now been trapped in a trading range for a month, taking sharp swings up and down but going nowhere. The Russell has been falling since the beginning of February. The Nasdaq has been selling off for a few weeks, but is still up 5.9 percent for the year. **********The major political news of the day, the acquittal of President Clinton, seemed to have no effect, analysts said, although the fall in bond prices accelerated after the two votes. Instead, it was disappointment that a move by the Bank of Japan to stimulate economic growth there did not go far enough and, therefore, would allow Japanese interest rates to move higher. **********What the Bank of Japan announced was a cut in a key lending rate to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent. But the central bank's announcement also showed that it would not buy any more Japanese Government bonds, a move that would both help to lower interest rates and raise the nation's money supply. Both steps, economists said, would stimulate Japanese growth much more than the rate cut. **********For bond investors, however, the decision not to buy more bonds was a signal that Japanese interest rates could continue to climb and draw investors away from the American bond market. Since October, the yield on 10-year Japanese bonds has jumped to 2 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent. While still lower than comparable American rates, the Japanese yields are drawing Japanese investors back home. **********Mr. Schoenholtz and Mr. Wien said that other factors were also undermining the bond market. One is that investors may be switching their views on Federal Reserve interest rate policy. They began this year expecting the Fed to cut its interest rate target as the economy slowed. Now they are wondering if the next Fed move will be a rate increase if the economy keeps moving along at last year's 3.9 percent pace. **********Another factor is that growth around the rest of the world may be bottoming, rather than continuing to decline. If that is the case, renewed buying of American exports could keep the economy growing too rapidly. Mr. Schoenholtz said that business confidence indicators in Europe had begun to trough and that there were some signs of revival in Asia. **********He also said that even if interest rates moved higher, they should begin to fall again later this year. One reason is that inflation will remain low. The other, he said, is that he believes higher interest rates will undermine the stock market. A stagnant or falling stock market will, in turn, slow consumer spending. And that would put the brakes on the economy, letting interest rates drop again."

Mr. Blair stayed overnight near Belfast and was said to be prepared to go to London on Wednesday afternoon to answer questions in Parliament about Kosovo, then to return here later in the day. **********When the negotiations ended tonight at about 11, several participants said there had been no breakthrough, but they disagreed on how much, if any, progress had been made. **********After meeting with party leaders for four and a half hours on Monday night, the Prime Ministers swept back and forth over this British province in a military helicopter today, emphasizing at several meetings that time is running out for settling the issue, which threatens to cripple or collapse the Northern Ireland peace agreement approved last April 10. **********The British Government has set a deadline of this Friday for an agreement. The sticking point is the insistence by Protestant leaders that the overwhelmingly Catholic I.R.A. make a ''credible beginning'' on disarmament before its political wing, Sinn Fein, is allowed to sit in a new Protestant and Catholic Cabinet of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Assembly is the body that would carry out the home rule provisions of the peace agreement. **********The Cabinet is to be created to pave the way for the return of home rule powers to the province by the London Government after 27 years. **********Failure to compromise this week could lead to another delay and possibly to a return to the widespread sectarian violence the peace agreement is supposed to end. **********The I.R.A. has observed a cease-fire for more than 20 months, but has repeatedly stated that it will not surrender a single bullet or an ounce of Semtex explosive. Unless it does, Protestant leaders say, Sinn Fein will be excluded from the new Assembly Cabinet. Sinn Fein points out that the peace agreement does not require disarmament before May 2000. **********As they began their day with short speeches at the Hazlewood Integrated College, an interdenominational high school in Belfast, the two Prime Ministers sounded optimistic. ''After talking to the parties here last night and again today,'' Mr. Blair said, ''I do believe that we can get there. It is within our grasp.'' **********Asked about his own religious background, he said: ''On my mother's side were very strong Irish Protestants. I married a Catholic, although I am Church of England. We are about to enter the 21st century. Do these things really have to pull people apart?'' **********Mr. Ahern, who is from a working-class district of Dublin, used humor to explain why he opposes a delay in negotiations, which people here have been calling ''parking the issue.'' ''In my end of Dublin,'' he said, ''if you park things too long they usually get vandalized.'' **********As the meetings continued during the day in Parliament Buildings, the home of the Assembly in Belfast, and in Hillsborough Castle, a British residence 20 miles south, an atmosphere of sectarian discord prevailed. **********The I.R.A. tried to improve its image among Catholics in a macabre way. The outlawed guerrilla organization said it would soon disclose the places it buried nine of its operatives executed secretly for being disloyal to the organization. **********In the grisly logic of Northern Ireland politics, this was to put a human face on terrorism by returning bodies to relatives. The I.R.A. statement on Monday night apologized for the delay in returning the victims, but not for killing them. **********Mr. Blair was heckled twice before teatime today, first by a Protestant Unionist Assembly member, Cedric Wilson, who hung out of a window and shouted angrily, but unintelligibly, at the Prime Minister as he left the helicopter on the lawn in front of Parliament Buildings. **********When Mr. Blair left the building at 3:45 P.M., surrounded by security men and accompanied by Mr. Ahern, a small group of older people held up signs attacking terrorism, and shouted ''God save Ulster'' and ''Never mind Yugoslavia. Think of Northern Ireland, your own country.'' **********Several well-dressed older Protestant women, who said they were relatives of I.R.A. victims, seemed to epitomize the fearful hard-line Protestant views on the I.R.A. disarmament issue. **********''The I.R.A. will get its united Ireland,'' one woman said. ''They'll still have all their ammunition, all their weaponry. And united Ireland will mean the ethnic cleansing of the Protestant people.''"

The brands leaving the Euro RSCG agencies, primarily Euro RSCG Tatham in Chicago, are being consolidated at other roster shops that handle more P.& G. assignments around the world. **********Euro RSCG Tatham and predecessor agencies had worked for P.& G. since 1956; the first assignment was Fluffo shortening (oh, those vintage product names). Two brands leaving the agency have been there since they were introduced by P.& G.: Mr. Clean liquid cleanser, which came out in 1957, and Head & Shoulders dandruff shampoo, which made its debut in 1960. **********This is the most sweeping of four roster realignments in the last year by P.& G., which spends more than $5.7 billion annually on advertising. Most of the changes have consolidated brand accounts by designating agencies to handle consumer products on a worldwide basis. Euro RSCG agencies lost one large assignment, the Vidal Sassoon line of hair care products, in October. **********''This decision is especially difficult because Euro RSCG has been a good agency partner for many years,'' Denis Beausejour, vice president for global marketing at P.& G. in Cincinnati, said in a statement. ''But unfortunately, we have never reached a critical mass of business with them.'' **********Indeed, in simplifying its agency lineup, P.& G. has favored four other worldwide networks, developing much closer ties to them at the expense of rivals like Euro RSCG. They are: the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago; D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Communications in New York, a unit of MacManus Group; Grey Advertising in New York, and Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. **********''There's no question they're going to focus on those four agencies,'' said Bob Schmetterer, chairman and chief executive at Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising. **********''Since this is part of a longer-term trend,'' he added, the account losses were ''not a surprise.'' **********Despite the consolidation, one Euro RSCG agency remains on the P.& G. domestic roster. Jordan McGrath Case & Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, which Euro RSCG acquired only last week, creates campaigns for Bounty paper products, Era detergent and Zest soap in North America. **********Mr. Beausejour said that he hoped the acquisition would ''help both agencies grow to better meet the needs of their clients,'' adding that P.& G. would continue to work with Jordan McGrath on a regional basis. **********Interestingly, when the acquisition was announced on Jan. 19, Mr. Schmetterer played down the significance of the fact that Jordan McGrath and Euro RSCG Tatham shared P.& G. as a client. **********''Now you know why,'' he said yesterday, adding that executives had known for about 18 months that such a consolidation was possible. **********Mr. Schmetterer confirmed a report this week in the trade publication Adweek that Steve Dworin, the vice chairman at Euro RSCG whose duties included overseeing the agency's relations with P.& G., had left the agency. Mr. Schmetterer said the departure was unrelated to the consolidation, but declined to elaborate. **********Now for the details of the changes. **********First, the two accounts that are estimated to be the largest of the five. One is Mr. Clean, which Euro RSCG Tatham had handled in the United States. That brand leaves for Grey, making Grey the brand's worldwide agency. **********The other is Head & Shoulders, a brand that Euro RSCG Tatham had handled in North America. Those duties shift to Saatchi & Saatchi, which handles the shampoo in Asia and Europe. Burnett remains the brand's agency in Latin America. **********The other three brands involved are Old Spice fragrances and toiletries, Metamucil laxatives and Clearasil acne medications. **********Old Spice sails from Euro RSCG Tatham, which had handled it in North America, and other Euro RSCG agencies in Europe. Destination: Saatchi & Saatchi, which handles the brand in China and Latin America and becomes its worldwide agency. **********Metamucil, handled by Euro RSCG Tatham in the United States and other Euro RSCG agencies in Europe, moves to Burnett. In a related move, Burnett becomes the worldwide agency for Metamucil by assuming from Grey the brand's accounts in Asia, Canada and Latin America; those shifts are also effective on April 1. **********As for Clearasil, that brand is leaving Euro RSCG Tatham, which had handled it in North America, and other Euro RSCG agencies in Europe. The new agency will be announced at a later date, P.& G. said. **********Two other brands that had been at Euro RSCG Tatham, Biz bleach and Coast soap, have not been advertised for about 18 months. Gretchen Briscoe, a spokeswoman for P.& G., said those accounts would remain inactive. **********The consolidation will cost Euro RSCG Tatham about $75 million in billings of total billings estimated at $565 million. In the last two years, though, the agency has landed assignments with billings estimated at $230 million from other advertisers like Bayer A.G., the Hunt-Wesson unit of Conagra Inc., Midas Inc., the Red Lobster unit of Darden Restaurants and the Sara Lee Corporation. **********The other brands consolidated by P.& G. in the last year, in addition to Vidal Sassoon, include Crest toothbrushes, consolidated at D.M.B.& B., and Safeguard soap, which left Jordan McGrath and Burnett for Saatchi & Saatchi. **********The largest of the consolidations came in January 1998 when P.& G. dismissed Wells BDDP in New York, now defunct, and moved United States accounts with billings estimated at $125 million to Saatchi & Saatchi (Oil of Olay beauty products), Grey (Pringles snack chips) and Burnett (Gain detergent)."

One could have thought so from the way executives of the Comcast Corporation and Mediaone Group Inc., two of the nation's biggest cable companies, trumpeted their $53 billion deal yesterday. **********Rather than cable, the word of the day was broadband: jargon for delivering high-speed data services, video and potentially even phone calls over advanced communications pipelines. **********The emphasis was not a surprise. Delivering an integrated basket of advanced services has become the main goal of almost every communications company in the nation. **********In the digital future, cable companies will be on the same playing field as the giant phone companies. Indeed, the new Comcast's most important rivals will be companies like Bell Atlantic. So while cable television provides most of of the combined Comcast-Mediaone's revenue and profits today, that business is not as glamorous nor does it offer as much potential as data services, broadband and the Internet. **********Providing advanced services, primarily high-speed access to the Internet, will probably be as vital to the combined company's future as is making sure that television service does not cut out during the Super Bowl. **********But in its reliance on cyberspace the enlarged Comcast, which will be the nation's No. 3 cable company, is hardly alone. The entire cable television industry is set to battle the local telephone industry to determine which sector will provide the United States' roughly 100 million homes with office-caliber Internet links. **********A combined Comcast-Mediaone, however, has a strong chance to emerge as the cable carrier with the best combination of size and Internet familiarity. Among the nation's biggest cable companies, only Cox Communications Inc. would deliver high-speed data services to a larger proportion of its customers, according to the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston. **********Even more important, Comcast has convinced at least some major players in the technology world that it really means business about broadband. **********''The bottom line is they get it,'' said John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of advanced data networking equipment, speaking yesterday from Phoenix, where he had just finished speaking to more than 300 senior Comcast executives. ''They talk on their announcement not about cable but about an integrated data, voice, video strategy. And they want to not only deliver that to the home but offer integrated offerings. They understand the future.'' **********Despite their depth of understanding, the future has not yet arrived. Including the effect of Comcast's pending $700 million deal to acquire control of Jones Intercable Inc., a combined Comcast-Mediaone would sell high-speed cable modem service to only about 135,000, or about 1.3 percent, of its roughly 10.6 million customers, according to the Yankee Group. Cox would sell cable modem service to 67,000, or about 1.8 percent, of its roughly 3.7 million customers. **********That would put the new Comcast far ahead of, say, Tele-Communications Inc., which the AT&T Corporation recently acquired for more than $30 billion. TCI sells high-speed data service to fewer than one-third of 1 percent of its customers, partly because its network has not been as thoroughly upgraded to offer data service as have Comcast's and Mediaone's, according to some analysts. **********But even though it outstrips many of its competitors, Comcast is in the same situation as the rest of the communications industry in having a long way to go before it makes high-speed Internet service into anything resembling a mainstream service. Only about a quarter of the nation's homes are linked to the Internet at all, and at roughly $500 a year, cable modem service remains an unaffordable luxury for many. **********But the chief obstacle in the way of the cable industry's vision of creating a broadband nation will not be price. It will be the local phone industry, which is bigger than the cable industry, has more money than the cable industry and has more customers than the cable industry. It may even have more influence in Washington than the cable industry (though that one is probably a toss-up). **********The biggest markets for both Mediaone and Comcast are in territory dominated by the Bell Atlantic Corporation, the nation's No. 1 local phone carrier. Even more relevant to the new Comcast than Bell Atlantic's size is the fact that Bell Atlantic plans to offer high-speed Internet access over normal phone lines in areas covering 7.5 million homes by the end of this year, a figure that Bell Atlantic plans to increase to more than 14 million by the end of next year. If Bell Atlantic can stick to that schedule, it may secure many of the households that could have become the new Comcast's best customers. Mediaone's biggest market is around Boston, while Comcast's biggest market stretches from Washington to Philadelphia. **********Cable modems are often faster than the new high-speed modems deployed by phone companies. The trade-off is that cable modem users share transmission capacity with their neighbors, while high-speed phone line users generally get their own private data pipe. **********''They put two cable companies together, but that doesn't change the nature of their product,'' said Susan Kraus, a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman. ''We think that our product is the winner and that it's more than competitive.'' **********In offering advanced data services, the new Comcast may even face internal problems. Comcast is part of the At Home cable modem consortium, which also includes AT&T, while Mediaone is part of the rival Road Runner group, which is led by Time Warner Inc. The two groups are vying to become the leading cable modem operator. That rivalry, of course, did not prevent Time Warner from forming a joint venture with AT&T to offer local phone service, but in an interview, Brian L. Roberts, Comcast's president, said that the Road Runner-At Home question was ''the only thing that's not perfectly clean.'' **********Ultimately, however, perhaps the main strategic question for the new Comcast is how much talent and investment can be directed toward new initiatives like the Internet and perhaps phone service without undermining the cash cow of its core television business. For all of yesterday's talk about broadband, the cable is still the thing for companies like Comcast and perhaps for Mediaone, which split from U S West, the Bell local phone giant, just last year. **********Referring to Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc., and Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner's cable television unit, Mr. Roberts said: ''If you go to the traditional cable people -- Jerry, Joe Collins, probably the Coxes, the world, the Comcasts -- they believe in a television-centric future that gets enhanced by these new things. If you go to the AT&T's and the Mediaones of the world, people from a phone background, they see video as the beginning and, hey, the phone business is 10 times bigger and data even more than that. One of the things I like is there will be a healthy balance of those two ideas in this company.'' **********But Mr. Roberts said he suspected he knew which way the future was tilting. **********''I was born in the cable business,'' he added. ''But that said, my daughter had a sleepover two weeks ago and she wakes up -- she's 11 years old -- and she and her friends go downstairs Saturday morning and they want to go on line. They did not go to watch cartoons. I was shocked. I said, 'Who are you chatting with? You're all in the house.' And they said, 'Oh no, we have friends out there.' ''"

The system may be partly deployed at sea, and could easily be moved to protect Taiwan. **********China would regard such a move as the establishment of a military alliance between the United States and Taiwan, Mr. Wang said. In China's view, that would represent an unacceptable violation of China's internal affairs, since China considers Taiwan a breakaway province, not a separate country. **********Mr. Wang's comments represent China's sharpest denunciation so far of American proposals for an advanced missile defense system that would use rockets to shoot down incoming missiles. **********Defense Secretary William S. Cohen told Congress this month that a full national missile defense system to protect the United States had not yet been tested, would cost billions of dollars, could be operating by 2005 at the earliest and even then would have a high risk of failure. But the notion of creating one has suddenly become popular in Washington. **********It is a smaller, more technically feasible plan for a theater missile defense system that makes Chinese officials like Mr. Wang so irate, even if it is also years away. **********Military experts say that since China would have difficulty invading Taiwan, it has instead focused on the possibility of launching missiles if, for example, Taiwan declares itself independent. In 1996, Beijing fired several missiles that splashed into the ocean near Taiwan, causing widespread panic on the island. **********In recent weeks China has apparently moved and targeted several batteries of missiles toward Taiwan. That may be little more than posturing, but it comes as United States tensions with China are growing. **********There has been an uproar recently in United States over allegations that in the last decade, China was given nuclear secrets by a Taiwan-born American scientist at the research center in Los Alamos, N.M. **********Mr. Wang dismissed such concerns. ''Chinese people have been very poor for many years,'' he said. ''Now we are awakening. But we will never have the goal of invading another country. Our goal is to pursue peace.'' **********Other military experts warn that the increasingly tense volleys of accusations from Washington jeopardize Asian-Pacific security, as well as relations with China. **********''If we treat China as an enemy it will surely become one,'' former Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in Hong Kong on Monday. ''I cannot point to a time in recent history when I was more concerned about the U.S.-China relationship based on what is going on in Washington today.'' **********Despite growing tensions, China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji, is planning to visit the United States early next month, the first such visit by a Chinese Prime Minister in 15 years. **********American policy on the China-Taiwan issue is delicate. In recent years the United States has pursued a strategy of ambiguity about whether it would protect Taiwan in a potential military conflict with the mainland. Washington has been careful not to declare that it would take military action, both to avoid provoking China and to avoid giving Taiwan license to act aggressively. **********Yet it was President Clinton's move, sending two aircraft carriers toward Taiwan in 1996, that effectively defused the China-Taiwan crisis at the time. **********Although tensions are growing now, China and Taiwan are proceeding with a series of occasional talks that began in 1993. The talks are aimed at exploring the ultimate goal of reunification, but they have made little headway. **********Mr. Wang, whose title is chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, said he was still planning to proceed with his first visit to Taiwan in September or October. It would follow a trip to mainland China by his Taiwan counterpart, Koo Chen-fu. **********China still wants to build a ''constructive strategic partnership'' with the United States, Mr. Wang said. ''Note the word constructive,'' he said. ''That means that it is progressing, moving toward closer, more cooperative relations.'' **********If a theater missile defense system is deployed in Taiwan, he added, ''then I ask you: are our relations constructive or destructive?'' **********For years Chinese officials have accused the United States, which has sold F-16 fighter planes and Patriot missiles to Taiwan, of violating the three joint communiques that provide the diplomatic framework for United States relations with China by promising to phase out American military support for Taiwan. Mr. Wang reitereated China's objection today. **********''When we look at today's Taiwan, which has already purchased advanced weapons systems from the United States, we think that it already constitutes an arms race on Taiwan,'' Mr. Wang said. ''There should be no such arms race on the island.'' **********American officials say building a theater missile defense system for Taiwan, a decision that is still far from being made, would not represent a change in policy. **********A senior American diplomat who is based in China, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said such a system would not be ''significantly different from selling F-16's or Patriots.''"

Big corporate customers, whose spending on insurance premiums can run to hundreds of millions of dollars annually, pay the brokers hefty commissions and fees on the assumption that the brokers work objectively for them, assembling the best coverage at the best prices with no interest in choosing one carrier over another. **********But it turns out that for years, brokers have also been quietly receiving incentive payments on the other end of the deal, from some of the very insurance companies that, according to custom and law, they are supposed to be dispassionately scrutinizing on their customers' behalf. The existence of these payments, called contingency fees, and the extent to which they should be disclosed, have become hot topics in the commercial insurance business in the United States, Canada and Britain. **********The rapid consolidation of the brokerage industry is making contingency fees even more controversial. Two giant brokers, the Marsh & McLennan Companies in New York and Aon in Chicago now dominate the field. And risk managers -- the executives who buy coverage for corporations -- have become increasingly concerned that brokers, less restrained by competition, could concentrate their business with insurers that offer the biggest incentives rather than those that provide the best service and lowest prices. **********''The broker says, 'Here's the fee for the service we're rendering,' and then you turn around and the broker has a sweetheart arrangement for shifting business to certain insurance companies,'' said Lance J. Ewing, who is in charge of buying coverage for GES Exposition Services in Las Vegas, Nev. **********''In a sense,'' Mr. Ewing said, ''the broker is double-dipping by getting the premium from me and getting money back from the insurance company.'' **********Insurance companies pay brokers fees based on volume and profitability. Brokers are paid more, for example, if claims on the coverage they arrange are low. **********Many corporate executives said they had been unaware of contingency fees until recently. State regulators in New York say they, too, were in the dark. **********The brokers acknowledge that they have not called attention to contingency fees but say they have always been willing to discuss them in general terms, if asked. They say that the payments from the insurers are a small part of their total revenue -- no more than 5 percent -- and that the fees do not influence their choice of carriers. **********But the insurance companies that pay the fees see them differently. Though some insurers do not pay contingency fees, many others consider them a necessary tool for making sure they get a slice of the pie. **********For months, the Risk and Insurance Management Society, an association mainly of American and Canadian risk managers, has been calling for full disclosure of the fees. And last summer, after becoming aware of the controversy, the New York State Department of Insurance issued a formal reminder that according to state law insurance buyers should be informed of all compensation arrangements between insurer and broker so they can ''understand the costs of coverage and the motivation of their broker.'' Department officials are meeting with brokers and risk managers later this month. **********IN January, Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker, said in  a joint statement with the risk managers association that if asked, it would tell customers which of their insurers were paying incentives. And it agreed to help customers work out a ''reasonable estimate'' of how much Marsh was deriving in contingency fees from each customer's total insurance business. **********But Robert J. Newhouse, a senior Marsh executive, said in an interview that the broker would not specify how much it was receiving from individual insurers. To do so, he said, would be handing ''sensitive information'' to competitors. **********The joint statement referred to Marsh's new disclosure plans as ''mutually agreeable.'' But the debate is far from over. The statement falls far short of the disclosure language in New York State law as well as an earlier policy statement by the association calling for disclosure of all broker compensation by each carrier on each line of business. Moreover, Mr. Newhouse said Marsh planned to apply the new policy only to its largest customers. **********SUSAN MELTZER, who buys property and casualty insurance for the Sun Life Assurance Company in Toronto and helped work out the joint statement, said the new policy was ''a first step.'' She said she had not heard that Marsh planned to limit disclosure to its largest customers. **********Diane Wolfson buys insurance for Domtar Inc., a pulp and paper company in Montreal. She said she ''would have loved'' to have Marsh simply open its books, as New York law envisions, and disclose its contingency fees to all customers without being asked. But she said she and other association executives who approved the joint statement ''wanted to work with them, wanted to encourage them.'' **********''How they will implement it, and how they make information available, and to what extent it is going to be difficult to get specifics -- well, we'll have to test it to see to what extent we can be satisfied with it,'' she said. **********Herbert M. Harrell, an Alexandria, Va.,  consultant to risk managers, called Marsh's new policy a step in the right direction but said, ''It is not equivalent to revealing their total financial interest.'' Contingency fees, he said, are not the only issue. **********''There are many different ways for income to come to brokers and influence them other than contingency fees,'' Mr. Harrell said. ''Examples would be for servicing an account and reimbursement for expenses such as advertising. Although brokers may try hard to put their clients' interests first, being only human, they may not always do so. It's less likely that a broker will succumb to temptation if his financial interests are known.'' **********Kenneth H. Pinkston, the chief executive in North America for the Willis Corroon Corporation of Britain, the third-largest broker, said that his company plans to begin including notices along with billings, telling customers which of their insurers pay contingency fees. **********Aon, the second-largest broker, said its policy was to identify carriers from which it receives contingency fees when it is asked to do so. It will tell customers the total amount it receives in contingency fees from a particular carrier, but says it cannot break down a single corporate client's contribution to the total. **********The New York regulators and the risk managers were unable to cite cases in which brokers had arranged coverage that might have been bought for less or had steered customers to insurers that failed to  meet clients' needs in other ways. But the risk managers said that is not surprising. **********''No risk manager wants to come forward and say, 'Yeah, my broker didn't get the best deal for my company,' '' Mr. Ewing said. ''Nobody wants that information out there. That would be almost job suicide.''"

His appeal came 10 weeks after student protests had touched off the worst rioting in Teheran since the overthrow of the Shah in 1979. **********''I have heard that some people in some quarters have said that they will take matters into their own hands and will mete out punishment,'' Mr. Khamenei said. ''Never! Never! In an Islamic system, punishment is the authorities' prerogative.'' **********''Any such act from any person is forbidden,'' he continued, ''and now that I have forbidden it, it is not only legally barred but religiously forbidden.'' **********Equally stunning, Mr. Khamenei gave effusive backing to President Mohammad Khatami, his rival in a tense power struggle between conservative clerics and a reform bloc led by Mr. Khatami, a leading cleric himself, who won a landslide election in 1997 on a promise to make Islamic rule more democratic. **********Until now, most Iranians have seen Mr. Khamenei as the main obstacle to President Khatami's efforts to make Government accountable, to subordinate the police and courts to an impartial legal system, and to broaden freedoms of speech and press. **********In wording with a broad resonance among the conservative clergy, Mr. Khamenei said that President Khatami ''is pious; he loves the household of the Prophet Mohammed, and he is working for the rebirth of Islam.'' **********Among reformers, the reference to the President working for a renewal of Islam was taken as particularly significant, since it appeared to be an acceptance, even if only tactical, of Mr. Khatami's insistence that what he wants is a more tolerant Islamic state, not Western-style secularism in which the Muslim faith is relegated to the private domain. **********In other remarks, Mr. Khamenei hinted that his shift of tone, after months of pronouncements that appeared intended to isolate President Khatami, resulted from concern that a showdown might not end in a triumph for the hard-liners, given Mr. Khatami's strong popular support. **********Even in the senior clergy, the hard-liners have suffered major defections, including several high-ranking clerics who were enthusiastic supporters of the event that traumatized Americans 20 years ago -- the Islamic militants' seizure of the United States Embassy, and the holding of American diplomats as hostages for 444 days. **********Mr. Khamenei said he had met with ''leading officials'' of the conservative and reform factions within the Government in recent days in an effort to reduce tensions, and claimed that his efforts had been successful. Failing to find common ground, he implied, could lead to both sides losing out to more radical elements who favor sidelining Islam. **********''The country and the revolution need unity,'' he said. ''The regime's two main forces, both faithful to the revolution, must reconcile themselves so as to isolate those who do not belong to us.'' **********Mr. Khamenei's remarks were assured of maximum impact by virtue of their having been delivered at the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the forbidding cleric who imposed a puritanical Islamic regime on Iran after 1979 that began to moderate only after Mr. Khatami won the Presidency, with more than 20 million of the 29 million votes cast. **********Mr. Khamenei's sermon at Friday prayers, rebroadcast across Iran, capped 10 days of commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Khomeini, who died in 1989. **********In his references to the student satirists, Mr. Khamenei appeared to take a leaf out of President Khatami's book, saying that it would be wrong to ''defame all students'' because ''two or three, either deliberately or through ignorance,'' had insulted Islam. **********In demanding that the students not be subjected to summary justice, as many opponents of Islamic rule have been since 1979, Mr. Khamenei described his instruction that they be given a proper trial as a fatwa, a religious decree that is considered binding on all Muslims. **********But he coupled this with a demand for a policy change by the Education and Culture Ministers, Khatami allies who have licensed reformist newspapers, broadened intellectual freedoms in schools and colleges, and otherwise worked to soften Islamic rule. **********''I expected more from the country's cultural managers,'' he said. ''I do not want the cultural atmosphere to be such that a person feels he can offer insults with impunity, even where such insults occur through carelessness.'' **********He added: ''I seriously call on the cultural officials to rethink and revise their policies.'' **********The mixed signals left Iranians to ponder where the balance of Mr. Khamenei's message lay. Among Khatami supporters, the prevailing view was Mr. Khamenei and his allies saw profound dangers in a new showdown. In this, the reformers said, there were echoes of 1979, when the Shah decided not to fight for his throne. Like the Shah, they said, the clerics in power now either abhor the prospect of a bloodbath, or fear that trying to settle the issue by force could end with the army, the police and even the Revolutionary Guards, the main bulwark of Islamic rule, splintering between conservatives and reformers. **********In any case, Mr. Khamenei's decision to hold out an olive branch came as a relief to Iranians, who had braced themselves for a new showdown on Teheran's campuses after the conservatives took up the issue of the student satire. **********After quelling the July riots by busing tens of thousands of supporters into Teheran for a show of force, Islamic hard-liners went on a broad offensive, holding secret trials of some student leaders, banning a leading reformist newspaper, and warning of further crackdowns through the speeches of hard-line conservative clerics. **********Last week, they appeared to have found a pretext for a new crackdown in the publication of a satire in an obscure campus magazine. The magazine, Wave, was circulated among students at the Amir Kabir University in Teheran, a scientific college, and took the form of an imaginary dialogue between a student and the Imam of the Age, an Islamic saint whose reappearance on earth ushers in a new age of justice, which is a major tenet of belief among Iran's Shiite Muslims. **********In the dialogue, the student asked the Imam to delay his re-appearance for a few days to allow the student to complete exams and other chores. **********The affair quickly mushroomed, with hard-line newspapers running banner headlines, conservative students staging protests demanding that the authors be hanged, and a senior police commander saying he would personally carry out any sentence imposed by Muslim clerics. **********Sensing the risk of a replay of July's events, when police units joined with Islamic militia gangs in an attack on a student dormitory, killing at least two students, President Khatami stepped in with a condemnation of the satire as ''insulting'' to Islam, but said the greater offense was the hard-liners' efforts to turn ''a small wave into a storm.'' **********After Mr. Khamenei's sermon today, the risk of the affair getting out of hand appeared to have been contained. But there were doubts as to how long a truce could last, given the countdown to parliamentary elections in February, when President Khatami hopes to win a majority that would strengthen the reform drive. In recent weeks, conservative clerics have vowed to use their powers in a powerful overseer body, the Council of Guardians, to reject any reformist candidates they deem threatening to Islamic rule."

The paint was peeling on the pillars supporting a worn-looking ''Palladium'' theater. Two attendants slept on the counter of a ticket booth. The hot dog concession was open, but out of food. **********The day's take at the gate: 12 people. Pretty paltry for a park that cost $50 million to build a few years back, when bright forecasts predicted 30,000 visitors a day. **********Like countless other virtually empty theme parks in China, the American Dream symbolizes the disastrous miscalculations made by both Chinese and foreign investors who were convinced by Chinese officials that a huge, child-loving populace would fuel a lively theme park business. Instead, projects have been swamped by excessive competition, poor market projections, high costs and relentless interference from local officials. **********The dismal outcome highlights a glaring fallacy in the rationale of innumerable foreign investors who come to China, misty-eyed about the potential demand in China's enormous market but blind to all the competing supply. **********''If we can just sell one item to every Chinese . . .'' has been a mantra of naive Western business executives for more than 100 years. But as the theme park business shows, as soon as a good idea appears, so much supply can quickly follow -- much of it cheap and low quality -- that a market is often inundated and even ruined. **********More than 2,000 theme parks popped up in China in the last five years, but the quality has been so poor at so many places that several hundred have gone out of business. Even worse, many of the potential consumers who were expected to flock to the parks have gone sour on the notion of theme parks altogether. **********Yang Zhengtai, a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai who has studied amusement park investments, estimates that more than 80 percent of the theme parks in China lose money. Construction on new parks has now slowed considerably. **********But that has not quelled talk here about bringing the biggest theme park creator of them all -- the Walt Disney Company -- to China. Despite the terrible track record of theme parks, Chinese officials from several cities are eager to lure such a big attraction. **********Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman, created a stir in China when he said in his annual report this year that ''we could be getting close to the time for a major Disney attraction in the world's most populous nation.'' Chinese officials in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen said coyly that they had been visited by Disney executives looking at prospective sites. **********Then Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, disclosed in March that talks had begun about building a theme park at a site near Hong Kong's new airport. It blew a bubble of optimism among Hong Kong executives that a new Disneyland could lift the former colony out of its economic doldrums. **********It also provoked a competitive reaction from Shanghai, where officials seem to feel that China's largest and fastest-growing city should be the leading candidate. The city's Mayor gamely suggested that Disney build a park in each city, Hong Kong and Shanghai. **********''There is a Disneyland in California, and another in Florida,'' said the Mayor, Xu Kuangdi. ''There is no reason why we can't have one in Hong Kong and one in Shanghai.'' **********One reason, it seems clear, is that China's experience with theme parks has been so disastrous. Another is that it has yet to be demonstrated that the market in any mainland Chinese city can support a high-cost theme park, like American Dream, which at $50 million ranks as one of the more expensive parks. Nor have any parks been able to attract a significant number of customers from other Asian countries. **********There are a few successes, like the Hangzhou Amusement Park, in the city by that name about 120 miles from Shanghai, where designers integrated the area's natural beauty into the park. **********Managers would not disclose gate receipts, but say they sometimes get more than 5,000 visitors a day. **********Shanghai officials acknowledge that Disney now favors Hong Kong, where negotiations over a possible theme park have been under way for months. In July, the Hong Kong government said that the discussions would continue until October and that the outcome was still unclear. **********On paper, China still looks like a field of opportunity for the theme park business. There is a fast-growing economy, an awakening middle class with leisure time and disposable income, and a cultural disposition toward pampering children, accentuated by a one-child policy. **********For a reality check, consider the experience of the American Dream park. **********The park was largely financed by Robert Miller, who founded DFS Group Ltd., the duty-free chain. Based on projections of three million visitors a year, tickets were priced at $12.50 each when the park opened in 1996, ambitious in a place where the average salary is still only $50 a month, but a sample of the optimism that infused the field at the time. **********''The first year wasn't bad,'' said Chen Xuan, head of ticketing at American Dream. ''But people in China only go to a park once, so once the people who could afford it came, sales dropped off.'' **********Mr. Yang, the professor who has studied amusement parks, said Chinese consumers were indeed willing to spend well, and to return again, but only if the park was good enough to merit it. **********''People feel that if there is a place with real quality, they're willing to pay,'' Mr. Yang said. ''If it just seems ordinary, they are unlikely to pay a second time.'' **********American Dream, next to a refrigerator factory on a run-down highway, is not easy to get to for ordinary customers, few of whom own cars. Most visitors come on buses organized by their factory or office, and younger groups come with tourist agencies. **********Making matters worse, dozens of competing parks sprouted in the surrounding area. An even more congested region, measured by theme parks, is around the city of Chengdu in Sichuan Province, where more than 100 parks fought for market share in the mid-1990's. Most have closed over the last two years. **********Interference from local officials, often the make-or-break factor in any large investment in China, was typical. Many officials seem to see foreign investors as cash cows, not partners, and insuring a high employment rate is one of their main concerns. At American Dream, more than 400 employees are still on duty each day, even though few have anything to do when they outnumber customers more than 25 to one. **********When the owners realized the staff was too big, they tried to carry out mass layoffs. Yet workers who had been promised jobs rioted, forcing the park to pay settlement charges to some and to rehire many others. **********Then there were the costs. With inexperienced managers, many Chinese parks pay top dollar for old theme park equipment. **********American Dream paid $540,000 for a Ferris wheel that was later found to be worth about $50,000. Other rides broke down as soon as they began operation. **********Like theme parks in the United States, American Dream was intended to offer a variety of rides and entertainment, including a boat ride, a modest imitation of a roller coaster and a movie theater. One section carries the flavor of America's Wild West; another looks like Main Street U.S.A. **********When revenue plummeted, disappointed local officials demanded compensation for roads and water lines built to support the projects, as well as taxes that had been waived. **********Desperate for customers, American Dream now sell tickets for $2.50 apiece, a fifth the original price. **********Some Chinese officials, who often seem to struggle to keep up with the chaotic side effects of the shift from a planned to a market-oriented economy, have denounced the plethora of theme parks as badly wasteful. **********Chen Lantong, a member of China's national legislature, complained at a recent session that too many construction projects in China are being built without official approval or inspection. Among large projects costing over $500,000, Mr. Chen estimated, more than 40 percent were beyond the control of central government authorities. **********At American Dream, employees are searching for a bright side. **********''Just staying open in this market is an achievement,'' a ticket seller said.

The Times has fired him, the country's press advocacy group has criticized him and ordinary people here express disgust that he criticized the royal court. **********''How can somebody malign a girl of 18 years to this extent?'' the Director of Public Prosecutions, Lincoln Ng'arua, said, referring to the King's fiancee and the questions the article raised. ''It is completely contrary to the morals of the community.'' **********''Truth is not the issue in the case,'' the prosecutor said, echoing the views of many here. ''You can say something truthful about someone and still be charged with defamation.'' **********Criminal prosecutions of this region's journalists have become more and more frequent in recent months as some governments try to stifle the work of reporters who air critical views, according to the Media Institute of Southern Africa, a press advocacy organization based in Namibia. **********A journalist from Angola who has been critical of the Government has been arrested four times since April. Earlier this year, two journalists from Zimbabwe were arrested after they reported that soldiers were planning to overthrow the Government. Two journalists from Malawi who quoted protesters at an opposition rally were charged with trying to incite a coup and a dozen journalists at a Zambian paper were charged with treason after publishing a report on the country's military abilities. **********The clash between news media freedom and the deeply held traditional reverence for Swaziland's monarchs began in early September at the annual Reed Dance, where King Mswati III, 31, has often selected a new bride from among the many bare-breasted maidens who dance before him. **********The King, on the throne since 1986, is following the tradition of his father, King Sobhuza II, who reigned for almost 61 years, overseeing the transition from British colonial rule to independence in 1968, and is believed to have had as many as 100 wives. **********This year, the King selected Senteni Masango, 18, as his latest liphovela, or fiancee. A short story about the selection ran in The Times. **********But a few reporters who had learned a little more about the liphovela went to burly, chain-smoking Mr. Makhubu with their scoop, guessing he was one of the few editors willing to publish it. **********On Sunday, Sept. 12, the front-page screamed, ''Liphovela a high school  dropout.'' The story ran without the reporters' names under the byline, ''Sunday Writers.'' Mr. Makhubu pledged that he would take any heat. **********The police quickly came calling, questioning reporters and editors. But Mr. Makhubu was undeterred. Days later, when a photo of Ms. Masango seated alongside one of the King's wives and another of his liphovelas came across the editor's desk, he followed his instinct. The wife was wearing a cap and gown from her own college graduation, and the irony was irresistible. ''The graduate, the liphovela and the dropout,'' read the front-page headline under the photo in the Sept. 19 paper. **********This time, court elders summoned the newspaper's executives to the  royal compound. The newspaper suspended Mr. Makhubu, saying he had disobeyed a direct order not to publish anything ''derogatory or controversial'' about ''the King, his wives and in particular his new liphovela.'' On Oct. 4, he was fired. **********Paul Loffler, the publisher, said in an interview that the paper stood by the first story, and is planning to pay Mr. Makhubu's legal expenses. He denied pressure to fire the editor, whom he called ''a very good journalist'' whose judgment sometimes erred, but said the second swipe at the liphovela was intolerable. **********In the streets, most people are unsympathetic to Mr. Makhubu. ''I don't care what they do to him,'' said Theodorah Dlamini, a 43-year-old schoolteacher, whose sentiment was typical. ''It was totally wrong. You accept what your father has decided, and the King is our father.'' **********Themba Nhlengethwa, 46, said: ''They were warned that there are things they shouldn't touch. Even if they were right, they are wrong.'' **********In Africa, freedom frequently clashes with deeply rooted cultural traditions. This is especially so in smaller countries like Swaziland, with just under a million people who share the same heritage, said Jeanette Minnie, regional director of the Media Institute of Southern Africa. **********Until now, Swaziland's authorities had usually used more subtle tactics, like summoning reporters and editors for chats with the elders, rather than turning to the colonial-era defamation laws, Ms. Minnie said. **********For now, Mr. Makhubu's passport has been revoked. He may end up in prison. And he has lost his job, with scant chances of working here as a journalist again."

Wonderful! You're Hired.,MANAGEMENT; Failed at Your Last Job? Wonderful! You're Hired.," **********At age 30, Michael Barach quit a lucrative job as a vice president for marketing for a $100 million furniture company to take charge of a start-up called Cartoon Corner -- a concept similar to the Disney Store, but with generic cartoons on the merchandise. **********The company was forced to dissolve within three years, partly as a result of his miscalculations and partly as a result of bad timing. That left Mr. Barach, who had graduated at the top of his business class at Harvard, broke and dispirited, but also dying for a second chance. ''I was unbelievably hungry,'' he recalled. ''I felt that I was behind my peer group.'' **********It was just this hunger that appealed to the venture capital firm  Bessemer Venture Partners, which installed Mr. Barach as chief executive of Mothernature.com, an Internet site offering natural products, about a year ago. Today, he argues that his failure at Cartoon Corner made him a sharper chief executive. ''I am much more humble and paranoid,'' he said. He is so convinced that at least one setback in a career is crucial to shaping business judgment that he looks to hire executives who have had similar disappointments. ''All my senior managers had something happen along the way,'' he said. **********Not long ago, only winners needed apply in corporate America. An executive who presided over a new product that flopped had little hope of being promoted or getting a better job elsewhere. An entrepreneur who crash-landed a start-up was unlikely to get cash from venture capitalists for his next brainstorm. **********But a decade's worth of talk from business schools and corporate trainers about the glories of risk-taking, combined with a shortage of executive talent in the current economic boom, has given a dash of class to failure. An executive or an entrepreneur who has cratered once is suddenly a sexy hire. **********''Failure is a badge,'' said Irv Grousebeck, an entrepreneurship professor at the Stanford Business School. These days, he says, managers who have made errors and suffered for them are wanted not just by Internet start-ups but increasingly by Fortune 500 companies eager to make themselves more competitive against small businesses that move fast and take chances. ''It is not just that these people had guts enough to take risks,'' he said. It is also assumed that ''they learned under the whip of urgency.'' **********This is not to say that job candidates with stellar, unblemished records need worry about going on unemployment. Nor does it mean that any failure will add the right kind of luster to the resume. A botched start-up will probably do; after all, it puts the candidate in the company of such successful entrepreneurs as John Chambers, the president of Cisco Systems Inc., and Alexander d'Arbeloff, the chairman of Teradyne Inc., each of whom has at least one disaster to his name. Also acceptable, but requiring a convincing explanation of what went wrong, are management blunders in corporations. **********Moral lapses, however, are widely viewed as unredeemable. ''Anything related to issues of integrity, trust and ethics are fatal flaws,'' said Rebecca Guerra, vice president for human resources at Ebay, the on-line auction house. **********Not all industry sectors find that failure has the same cachet. Nowhere is it more in vogue, of course, than Silicon Valley, where new technology companies like to brag that they are shattering the old corporate mold with their venturesome employment policies. **********''Failure is as much a credential as success -- even, perhaps, more so,'' said David Cowan, a venture capitalist in Menlo Park, Calif., who has installed chief executives with checkered track records at a half-dozen Internet start-ups. ''If they are coming off a failed business, they have an innate understanding of the consequences of running out of cash, and they focus on long-term issues earlier on than other people.'' **********Even conservative employers, like banks and accounting firms, are coming around to the notion that failure is tolerable in small doses. Gene Manheim, a partner with Herbert Mines Associates, a New York recruiting firm, said they might have no choice. ''The pool of talent is already too small to thin it out again by eliminating those who have failed,'' he said. **********Over the last decade, Arnold P. Cohen, a retail executive, played a leading role at three well-known clothing concerns -- London Fog Industries, Today's Man Inc. and J. Peterman -- as each descended into serious financial trouble or went bankrupt. Despite this fiasco of a management record, everyone who has worked with Mr. Cohen sings his praises in one area: merchandising. With executive talent in retailing scarce, American Malls International, a Washington, D.C., real-estate developer, recently hired him as the merchandiser for its new malls in Japan. **********The volatile job market is also fueling the trend. Job hopping by managers has become more common in recent years as corporate America has downsized, and companies are hiring more people in their 40's and 50's. By definition, these corporate longtimers have more bloopers in their backgrounds than newly minted M.B.A. graduates. **********Deloitte & Touche, the big management-consulting firm, which used to focus on fresh-faced MBA graduates, has started to reach for people in their 30's and beyond. ''We need people with practice and experience and, hey, if you are out there competing in the world, life happens,'' said Jim Wall, who is in charge of hiring at Deloitte & Touche. **********Mr. Wall predicted that the firm would be hiring even more people with compromised records. ''We are going to see a lot of M.B.A. students who heretofore had mostly considered opportunities in investment banking and corporate strategy but now are taking the fly right out of business school on some start-up venture,'' he said. ''Some are going to be successful, and some of them are not, and it is the latter group that isn't going to want to come back. Are they still valuable as talent? You bet.'' **********Notice his choice of words. For all the new luster of failure, career counselors say, employers generally prefer euphemisms to describe it. ''We are interested in people who have worked beyond their comfort zone,'' said Nancy Eberhardt, whose cheeky title is queen of culture for Carl M. Freeman Associates, a real estate developer in Potomac, Md. ''The person we like to see is the person who took a risk to do something bigger than they were.''"

Rubin, the State Department spokesman. But the use of force, as opposed to the threat of force, was completely different, he said. **********What NATO was now trying to do, President Clinton said this afternoon, was ''to stop the brutal repression'' by the Serbs. **********''Our strikes have three objectives,'' he said -- to ''demonstrate the seriousness of NATO's opposition to aggression,'' to deter President Milosevic ''from continuing and escalating his attacks'' in Kosovo, and to damage Serbia's capacity to wage war in the future. **********A top Pentagon planner conceded, ''We have no great expectations that Milosevic is going to back down and agree to a satisfactory peace settlement because of one bombing raid or 10.'' **********In his televised speech tonight, Mr. Clinton left no easy way out for Mr. Milosevic, insisting that he would have to agree to allied terms to end the bombing. On the other hand, the President let the Serbian leader know that he need not fear an American invasion. **********''I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo to fight a war,'' Mr. Clinton said, apparently seeking to reassure the American public but at the same time giving Mr. Milosevic an incentive to hang on. **********But neither Mr. Clinton nor other senior American officials would address the questions that troubled many in this and other NATO capitals tonight: What would constitute success for the NATO effort? If the ultimate goal is peace in Kosovo, who is to maintain it once the bombs have stopped falling? Is the plan to keep bombing more or less indefinitely? If so, how will that help Kosovo? **********''These bombs are not going to do the job,'' said Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican who was a naval pilot in the Vietnam War. ''It's almost pathetic. You're just going to solidify the determination of the Serbs to resist a peace agreement. **********''You'd have to drop the bridges and turn off the lights in Belgrade to have even a remote chance of changing Milosevic's mind,'' he said. ''What you'll get is all the old Vietnam stuff, bombing pauses, escalation, negotiations, trouble.'' **********Mr. McCain, who is expected to announce his candidacy for President next month, said the Administration was caught with unpalatable alternatives -- bombing, which he said ''has never worked without ground forces,'' and the use of ground forces, which he said had little support on Capitol Hill or in the nation as a whole. **********Clearly irritated by the President's critics, Mr. Rubin said that ''in their opposition to the use of air power, they have offered no alternative other than the appeasement of President Milosevic's policies, which is something unacceptable to this Administration.'' **********But in fact some of the critics offered more. **********David Owen, the former British Foreign Secretary, said in a telephone interview that he sympathized with Mr. Clinton's wish to make a stand in Kosovo. But it was ''completely useless,'' he added, to resort to air power while letting it be known that there was no intention of using or threatening to use ground forces. **********''NATO seems to think it can have half a war,'' said Lord Owen, who worked as a high-level mediator in the Bosnian crisis. ''They should have built up ground forces in Macedonia -- not a token force, a big one, say 60,000 troops or more. The only thing that will get Milosevic's attention is the real prospect that you're going to sweep his troops out of Kosovo and stay there to keep them out.'' **********An allied force of 25,000 in Kosovo was the goal, of course, of the peace treaty that Mr. Milosevic spurned after talks near Paris. But invading in order to install such a force might require as many as 100,000 men, and they would have to impose peace, not keep it. **********Once before, Mr. Milosevic yielded to the force of bombing. But that was during the Bosnian crisis. Bosnia was an independent country, and the problem concerned Serbs who lived there, not Serbs who live in a province (Kosovo) that is Serbian. And the bombing of 1995 was backed by a Croatian ground offensive. **********Otherwise, bombing has worked only when followed up. More often, it has failed. **********Hitler pulverized the East End of London, to say nothing of industrial cities like Coventry, without weakening the Churchill Government or the British people's will to resist. The United States never broke the spirit of Ho Chi Minh or the North Vietnamese with its ceaseless raids on Hanoi and Haiphong. Quite the opposite. **********More recently, Iraq offers a relevant case in point. **********The weeks of bombing that preceded the all-out American ground attack in the Persian Gulf war in 1991 reduced the efficacy of such fighting units as the Republican Guard. But as Washington admitted at the time, it was not enough. Tanks and infantrymen were also needed. **********In the years since then, there have been many more air attacks, each intended to ''teach Saddam Hussein a lesson'' or to ''maintain our credibility'' or to ''reduce his war-making capacity.'' None achieved much. **********The stakes this time are much higher. A botched operation could seriously damage the effort to formulate a new peacekeeping and crisis-management role for NATO, which Mr. Clinton had hoped to unveil at NATO's 50th anniversary summit here next month. Even a successful operation could seriously damage American relations with Russia. **********Quite apart from the broader implications, the bombing campaign, which is the first offensive action ever undertaken against a sovereign nation by NATO, constitutes a leap in the dark. No one really knows how Mr. Milosevic will react or, for that matter, how the Kosovo Albanians will react. Protected by alliance bombers, they may feel less inclined than before to accept the peace agreement, which includes an interim autonomy deal that would defer independence for at least three years."

And Amazon.com shoppers logging in from Merrill Lynch & Company tended to select the video ''Tae-Bo Workout: Instructional and Basic.'' **********To generate the lists, Amazon mines the data that all of its customers provide when they shop: a shipping address, an E-mail address and the list of items bought. The shipping addresses let it create its best-seller lists based on geographic areas like towns or foreign countries. Using the Internet domain name in the E-mail address, Amazon can often identify a customer's employer or college, for example. **********The lists give no actual sales figures. Nor do the purchase circles identify individual buyers, even though Amazon.com's data base is capable of doing so. Amazon said these rankings of ''uniquely best-selling'' products -- titles that are more popular with a particular group than among its customers generally -- are intended to let browsers know the buying preferences of people with whom they might have something else in common, or about whom they might simply be curious. **********Amazon and other on-line retailers have long offered recommendations generated by software that analyzes buying patterns, letting a customer know that people who bought the same R.E.M. and Miles Davis CD's also tend to like Liz Phair, for instance. The drawback to such referrals is that a customer knows very little else about who those other customers are. **********So Amazon came up with preference circles to give a customer a stronger sense of common interest with fellow shoppers. The premise is that peer pressure might make the lists more effective as a sales tool than a generic list that reflects the buying habits of the entire country. Amazon said the preference circle lists would be updated weekly or monthly, depending on the size of the group. Customers can sign up to have new lists E-mailed to them. **********Whatever Amazon.com's motives, once word began circulating last week of Amazon.com's new program, privacy-rights advocates began sounding alarms. **********''An awful lot of people, including myself, purchase books using their own money but using the E-mail address that's assigned to them by their company,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization in San Diego. Ms. Givens said she would not want one of her own recent book purchases to show up on a list that might appear to be endorsed by her organization. **********The privacy policy on Amazon's site says the company does not disclose information about individual customers or their purchases to outside parties. But the policy statement also says that the company reserves the right to do so in the future. Amazon.com, however, allows customers to indicate by E-mail that they never want their information released. **********''We are continuing to look at ways that we can take this data and re-apply it back to Amazon.com in a way that is fun and interactive, but is done in a way that our customers are comfortable with,'' Mr. Capelli said. ''We would never do anything that would compromise or call into question individuals' confidentiality for items they have purchased.'' **********Corporate confidentiality is a separate issue from individual rights. When Amazon's computers zoom in on purchasing quirks at a specific company, the results could end up revealing more than Amazon's customers might like, since the lists are available to any curious outsider. **********Take, for example, Levi Strauss & Company, which has been trying to make its classic jeans brand hip again. Amazon's purchase circle listing for Levi says that employees at the company have been busily ordering the books ''Strategic Brand Management,'' ''Building Strong Brands'' and ''Street Trends: How Today's Alternative Youth Cultures Are Creating Tomorrow's Mainstream Markets.'' **********Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for Levi Strauss, said company officials would not comment on the Amazon list because, ''as you know, we're intently focused on revitalizing the brands here.'' **********The Levi book purchases simply confirmed what outsiders already knew about the company's hot buttons. But critics wondered what clues outsiders might glean about the internal issues of a company if its book list revealed heavy purchases of titles about international expansion, say, or finding a new job. **********Anita L. Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and co-author of a recent book, ''Privacy Law'' (West Publishing, 1999), said that ''confidential business plans or corporate issues might be indirectly revealed'' by the lists. But she said that Amazon's use of customer data in this way is ''disturbing but not necessarily illegal.'' **********There are laws protecting some facets of individual privacy in this area. A Federal law prohibiting video stores from releasing movie rental records was passed in 1988 after reporters obtained such records for Robert H. Bork when he was a Supreme Court nominee. And most states have similar laws protecting library patrons from disclosure of their book-borrowing habits. **********But ''things like the Bork law governing video checkouts or library records don't apply when you have information aggregated'' for many individuals, Ms. Allen said. And in any case, the privacy laws that would protect individuals in such cases have not been shown to apply to corporations, she said. **********Mr. Capelli of Amazon said last week that no companies had complained about the purchase circles. But because some individuals had said that they did not want their purchasing data used for such lists, the company amended its Web site last Thursday, telling customers that they could send an E-mail to have their purchases excluded from the lists. And companies can send faxes on their corporate letterhead requesting that their employee purchasing lists be removed from the site. **********Amazon also updated its privacy policy to mention the purchase circles. Customers who never read the privacy policy or visit the purchase circle pages, however, are unlikely to see that opt-out information or know that they have a choice about how their purchasing data is used. **********Whatever the marketing and privacy implications, the lists do offer an unscientific survey of regional tastes. Outside of major cities like Los Angeles and New York, the lists of best-selling music, for example, are remarkably homogeneous across the country, with artists like Sarah McLachlan and the Dave Matthews Band predominating. **********The book lists show more regional variation. A series of novels about an imminent apocalypse by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins is popular on the charts in Memphis, Wichita, Kan., and Jackson, Miss. But none of those books made it to New York's list, which after Mr. Andersen's ''Turn of the Century,'' lists ''The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' and ''For the Relief of Unbearable Urges.''"

Sometimes it is like a real hard snap, he says, a cold thunder fired through the blue Arctic ice. Sometimes it is more brittle, like the dry crack of an ice cube when it breaks. **********''That means it's O.K.,'' said Mr. Paul, who has been driving huge loads -- like the 25-foot-wide, 118,000-pound dump truck bed lashed to his rig -- up and down the Yellowknife ice road for 15 years. ''It's when you don't hear anything that you start to worry.'' **********During the coldest part of the tough winters here in Canada's remote Northwest Territories, when the crazy quilt of big lakes and small ponds in the region freezes over but the mines keep digging, men like Mr. Paul take their trucks off the regular road and onto a blue highway that crosses 400 miles of frozen lakes and bleached-out tundra. **********This road is itself a metaphor for Canada: this is the wild cold that novelists use to paint the country's dreamscape; the hard work of rugged people who, together, turn the great cold to their own advantage. **********The road is also about money -- the millions it costs to create, the many millions more it allows the mining companies to save by bringing in heavy equipment on trucks rather than in planes. **********The season is short, from early February, when the ice turns solid down four feet, to late March or, if they are lucky, the first week in April, when the ice goes spongy, and silent. **********But while the ice road is open, these tundra truckers will carry more than 1,200 heavy loads north. For the last two years, most have taken fuel and heavy equipment to the Ekati mine near Lac de Gras, Canada's first diamond mine. **********Mr. Paul said the prospector who found the diamonds advised him long ago to invest in the mine. Mr. Paul did not. ''I'm not a gambler,'' he said. ''That's why I didn't do it.'' **********He does not gamble on the road either. He rarely listens to music, preferring to focus on the aqua blue strip of cleared ice that winds through the vast white plains. Besides the rumble of the apple-red, 18-speed Western Star diesel rig, the only sounds come from the ice itself, and the three C.B. or satellite communications systems. **********Mr. Paul, 44, is not superstitious. There is no rabbit's foot or horseshoe in the cab. Just a thermos of coffee, and Mr. Paul wearing a pair of beaded moccasins, chain-smoking Export A menthol cigarettes and popping small pieces of hard candy. **********''The ice don't bother me one bit,'' said Mr. Paul, a welder when the ice road melts away. ''Some people can't do it. But there's no gray hairs on my head. It's just like I was on the highway.'' **********Canadians have long exploited the hard flat surfaces of frozen lakes to travel in winter, but until recently they had never risked putting such heavy loads in such great numbers on the ice. **********''It's taken a number of years to get the road where it's at,'' said John Zigarlick, chairman of Nuna Logistics, which creates and maintains most of the road. ''But it's not perfect.'' **********A local company, Robinson Trucking, pioneered the first ice route to the northern mines in 1979, and it still works on the road and some of its spurs. At first the process was pretty crude. Using indigenous scouts and the intuition born of living in a harsh environment, they blazed a rough trail across the lakes by snowmobile. Then a plow cleared the snow, continuing on the land portages between lakes. **********Today, Mr. Zigarlick said, global positioning satellites guide helicopters along a route across a lake. When the copter lands on the opposite shore, the plow operator heads toward its lights to keep the route true. Ice conditions are checked with radar, and water is sprayed on the surface, like repaving. **********It takes a special kind of driver to take a rig weighing over 150,000 pounds onto the ice. Some of the youngest ones picture adventure but find boredom as they creep through the white desert. They have been known to jam a stick under the dash to hold down the accelerator, while they put their feet up on the seat and test the capacity of their stereo systems' woofers. **********Then there are veterans like Ralph Noseworthy and Terry Sparks, who come from Newfoundland, and who revel in the camaraderie of the road, telling tall tales and working hard to razz newcomers. **********What they all have in common is the ice, and their first encounter with it: that moment of edging the behemoth trucks onto the comparatively fragile and unpredictable surface that separates them from a few hundred deadly feet of water. **********''The first year I came up it was all the same as any other road until I heard the noise of the ice,'' said Billy Fitzgerald, 43, who brings his own truck out from Newfoundland to ride the ice roads. ''It was almost like a pane of glass on a good frosty night, and I was saying to meself, 'What have I got into?' '' **********This is barren country, where ravens rule the road. In great numbers they dance grisly jigs behind the upturned ribs of slain caribou left by local hunters. Sometimes, when Billy Fitzgerald's truck rumbles by and he holds out a cracker, they come right up to his open window. **********''Close enough to see the black in his beady black eye,'' he says. **********When it snows too much or blows too hard to keep the road open, the truckers hole up for a day or two at Lockhart Camp to wait out the storm. That is when the tables outside the always-open kitchen groan under the bombast and bragging about the ice road. They still talk about the time the three loads of silver ore went right to the bottom of Hottah Lake, or when Mr. Paul had to wait an hour and a half for a herd of caribou to cross. **********They say the lakes are named for drivers who plunged through and felt the icy fingers of the water close around their hearts. There is Pat's Lake for one, and Pikrul Lake, where one unlucky soul named Doug Pikrul was said to have gone through twice in one day. They pulled him out, dried him off and sent him back on the road the next day. **********It is hard to sift lore from reality but it is clear that the risk of breaking through is real. ''We've had trucks go through,'' said Dale Wheaton, freight manager at Robinson Trucking, ''but we've never lost anyone yet.'' **********The money is good, and the season is short. About half of the drivers come from Newfoundland, where there is no work (''That's cause it's all been done,'' Mr. Sparks said). They can return home with as much as $25,000 for a little over two months' work. They cram in as many trips as they can, and only a near blizzard can keep the trucks idling. **********As the days lengthen, and winter ends, the drivers start to pine for home. ''Oh, when I'm driving back I'm thinking of me woman,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. Then, inevitably, in the middle of summer, when he is on his patio, having a beer, he will tell a story about the ice, and about the boys who ride the blue highway. **********''I'm thinking, 'I got through it this time,' '' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''And I'll be hoping the next year will be the same.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/business/three-years-later-at-hilton-a-deal-maker-plays-his-card.html,Andrew Pollack,1999-09-12,"Hilton Hotels Corp president Stephen F Bollenbach, interviewed at his office in Beverly Hills, comments on his reputation as master deal maker and $3.1 billion deal to acquire Promus Hotel Corp; photos (M)",1229,,The New York Times,Business Day,Biography,article,"Three Years Later at Hilton, A Deal Maker Plays His Card","Three Years Later at Hilton, A Deal Maker Plays His Card"," **********STEPHEN F. BOLLENBACH, president of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, likes to make playful $1 bets with his company executives about the price of Hilton's stock. He stuffs the dollar bills representing those wagers into the frame of a picture -- of him and Barron Hilton, the company chairman -- hanging on the wall behind his desk. **********Recently that stock has been a poor bet, even with the announcement by Hilton last week that it would pay $3.1 billion in cash and stock to acquire the Promus Hotel Corporation. **********Indeed, Mr. Bollenbach has found it hard to live up the gargantuan expectations Wall Street had for him. From the moment he joined the company three and a half years ago, bringing a reputation as a master deal maker, investors have been disappointed that he has not done a big acquisition. Now that he has, many investors are wondering whether Mr. Bollenbach was desperate and  paid too much. **********''From the time he walked in the door as C.E.O.,  there were great expectations that his Mark McGwire-like reputation would be extended to Hilton,'' said John Rohs, an analyst at Schroder & Company. ''The stock clearly reflects the fact that he hasn't hit the home run, but it's not for lack of trying.'' **********If Mr. Bollenbach, at 57, is frustrated, he didn't show it in an interview at his office last week. Nor did he express any sense of relief at finally having made a big acquisition. Like Mark McGwire, Mr. Bollenbach says he is not out to hit home runs, just to win ball games. ''My approach isn't trying to measure success by the number of transactions,'' Mr. Bollenbach said. ''It's kind of a lousy measure. The shareholders are interested in value for the company.'' **********But creating that value, as measured by stock price, has been difficult.  Hilton's stock, which fell slightly after the deal with Promus was announced, closed on Friday at $10.8125, down more than $6 so far this year. An investor who owned a share of Hilton worth about $20 when Mr. Bollenbach took over, would now own a share of Hilton and Park Place Entertainment, the gambling company spun off at the beginning of this year, together worth only about $22. **********In fairness, most hotel stocks have been falling because of fears about softness in the business.  And rather than rushing into the Promus deal, in fact, Mr. Bollenbach passed on it more than a year ago because the price was even higher then. **********Many analysts agree that the deal should help Hilton strategically in the long run. The agreement will give Hilton several new brands, including Doubletree Hotels, Embassy Suites and Hampton Inns, and move it into segments of the market beyond luxury business hotels. And it will make Hilton one of the Big Three of the hotel business along with Marriott and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide. **********''I think the other companies are going to be marginalized,'' Mr. Bollenbach said, referring to those outside the Big Three. ''To me, it's like being a soft-drink seller when you're not Coke or not Pepsi. How do you deal with it?'' **********If Mr. Bollenbach did not purposely market himself as a deal maker, his history spoke for him. In the last 10 years, Mr. Bollenbach, mainly working as a chief financial officer at various companies, has rapidly engineered big deals and moved on -- often taking loyal aides with him. He helped rescue Donald Trump from financial difficulties. He helped break the old Marriott into two companies. As chief financial officer of the Walt Disney Company in 1995, he engineered the acquisition of ABC. **********So when Mr. Bollenbach came to Hilton in February 1996, the stock climbed more than 20 percent in two days. Within months, Hilton agreed to pay $2 billion to buy Bally Entertainment, to make Hilton the largest gambling company. **********Last year, he engineered the spinoff of Park Place Entertainment, of which he is chairman.  One rationale was that the gambling business, with its low valuation, was weighing down the  hotel company's stock. But in the last couple of weeks, Park Place's share price rose past Hilton's, causing Mr. Bollenbach to lose a dollar in a bet with Park Place president Arthur Goldberg. **********But in 1997, Hilton lost out to Starwood in a protracted battle to buy the ITT Corporation, owner of the Sheraton hotels and Caesars casinos. Hilton also had talks in the past about buying Circus Circus, the casino company now known as Mandalay Resort Group, and some of the hotels of Patriot American Hospitality, now known as Wyndham International. Yet another possible deal explored from time to time has been a merger with Hilton Group P.L.C., the British company once known as Ladbroke that controls the Hilton name overseas. **********The two companies have become so closely aligned, sharing reservations systems and sales forces, that if they eventually merge, as seems likely, Mr. Bollenbach said, ''it'll be a non-issue.'' **********And the unsuccessful ITT bid, which was widely portrayed as the biggest failure of Mr. Bollenbach's career, doesn't look so bad in retrospect. Park Place managed to buy Caesars from Starwood this year at a price lower than what Hilton would have effectively paid in 1997. **********''Doing an acquisition is the easiest thing in the world,'' Mr. Bollenbach said. ''The hard thing is making sure you don't overpay and the second hard thing is managing what you bought.'' **********It is that second challenge -- integrating Promus -- that will occupy him for the near future. **********The word in the industry on Mr. Bollenbach is that he is not a true hotelier like Bill Marriott, who is said to walk into his company's properties to check if the beds are being made correctly. Asked if he ever stayed in a Hilton hotel incognito to check out the service, Mr. Bollenbach replied: ''What do you think, I'm nuts? Of course not.'' He goes in style, escorted by the hotel manager. Much of the actual hotel operations are left to the executive vice president, Dieter H. Huckestein. **********But Mr. Bollenbach is involved in the company's advertising strategy, its fledgling Internet operations and in major hotel renovations. And while he doesn't check the temperature of the soup, he said, ''I promise you that's not what made Marriott get successful.'' **********What did, he said, was getting other people to spend $20 billion to build hotels that Marriott can manage -- an operation in which Mr. Bollenbach had a hand during previous stints at Marriott. **********MR. BOLLENBACH, the son of a milkman,  grew up in Southern California and got his start in business working for Daniel K. Ludwig, the industrialist who was once one of the richest men in the world. **********Mr. Bollenbach's work for a string of hotel companies helped prepare him to work for Barron Hilton, the hotel company's chairman and biggest stockholder and the son of the company founder, Conrad Hilton. Mr. Hilton, 71, is now little involved in the company, spending his time flying gliders and helicopters on his Nevada ranch and taking fishing trips to Alaska. Mr. Bollenbach's pleasures consist largely of travel -- tacking side trips with his wife, Barbara, onto his business trips around the world. They have two grown sons. **********Despite his job-hopping, Mr. Bollenbach has said Hilton will be his last job. Since his deal-making has yet failed to excite investors, Mr. Bollenbach's effectiveness in transforming Hilton will be judged only over time."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/06/business/computer-chip-researchers-set-to-showcase-advances.html,John Markoff,1999-12-06,,820,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Computer Chip Researchers Set to Showcase Advances,Computer Chip Researchers Set to Showcase Advances," **********Computer chip researchers are gathering for an industry conclave in Washington this week, where a range of technical presentations are expected to revive the recently flagging spirts of the semiconductor community. **********The announcements planned by I.B.M., Lucent's Bell Laboratories, Motorola, the University of California at Berkeley and other research laboratories at the International Electron Device Meeting suggest that researchers are finding ways to accelerate the speed at which chip makers can further shrink the size of the microscopic transistors that are the basic component of microelectronic systems. **********Word of the advances are significant now, since a number of prominent semiconductor researchers have been expressing concerns that the industry might be approaching fundamental physical limits that might curtail chip development. **********''This is important because in the last five years there has been a doomsday feeling among semiconductor researchers,'' said Chenming Hu, a University of California at Berkeley electrical engineering professor. A research team led by Mr. Hu will present a paper detailing a new kind of transistor that the research team believes can be scaled down to just 18 nanometers -- or about the width of 100 atoms. That would be about one-twentieth the size of today's smallest transistors. **********The Berkeley researchers predict that the new transistor design could lead to devices that store 400 times as much data as today's densest memory chips. **********While such a transistor might not be common for another decade, the Berkeley announcement indicates that it might be possible to extend the future of microscopic semiconductor circuitry well beyond the year 2014, when some researchers have been predicting that the technology would meet its theoretical limits. **********Since the 1960's, the chip industry has operated under an assumption that had proved so reliable that it is known as Moore's Law -- named for the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who had observed that the number of transistors that chip makers could fit on a given piece of silicon was doubling every 18 months. But recently, even Mr. Moore himself has warned that the growth rate was coming at such spiraling costs that Moore's Law might no longer be sustainable. **********This week's meeting, however, may indicate that the circuiteers have made new breakthroughs in  their quest for the infinitessimal. **********Moreover, while the Berkeley announcements describe advances that may not have any immediate application, I.B.M. researchers will present a series of papers detailing advances in transistors and materials that are to become available soon in the company's commercial products, while having a potentially far-reaching impact on future designs. **********A group of I.B.M. researchers, in cooperation with researchers from the Infineon Technologies Corporation, will report on a new kind of vertical transistor -- a sort of semiconductor high-rise architecture that will make it possible to build elaborate composite chips that will stack computing logic circuits on top of memory circuits within the same chip design. Today's chip designs typically lay out such circuits in relatively sprawling one-story, low-rise configurations. **********The stackable design could circumvent the so-called ''processor-to-memory'' delays that are the most significant limiting factor in the design of high-speed computers. **********''As we get faster and faster processors it becomes crucial to get memory close to the processor,'' said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, an industry consulting firm in Seaford, N.Y. **********I.B.M. executives said the new technology could conceivably spawn a renaissance in computer design. **********I.B.M. will also report on a new complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, chip-making technology that the company says should pave the way for a generation of microprocessors that will reach computing speeds above a billion operations a second. The new technology is based on a relatively new kind of manufacturing process known as silicon-on-insulator, which offers higher speeds and lower power consumption than conventional silicon-based CMOS chips. **********The company would not state specific product dates but said it generally makes such technology announcements a year to 18 months  before products are introduced. **********Researchers at Motorola Laboratories have developed a new class of materials known as perovskites (pronounced per-AHV-skights) that will permit a new class of transistors. **********Perovskites are a class of crystalline oxide materials with singular material properties that may prove  preferable to the conventional silicon dioxides which have long been used as insulating materials on chips. **********At last year's industry meeting,  the greatest excitement surrounded the use of copper wires as an alternative to the traditional aluminum wires in semiconductor chips -- a development that allows for higher speeds at lower power consumption. Now, the introduction of new materials and chip-making processes like silicon-on-insulator suggest that scientists have found another way to potentially make great strides in chip circuit density and performance. **********At this week's meeting, molecular computing researchers are scheduled to announce development of a memory device no larger than a single molecule. Researchers have been making great strides this year, and they say that their work points to a path for the computing devices that will be needed once conventional lithographic chip-making processes begin to fail. Lithography is a means for etching circuitry onto chip surfaces."

All five sites promised to have the best collection of online information for children, and all five employed human or software filters to block pornographic, profane and violent sites.

But they said Mr. Lee's statements had not provided enough evidence to lead to his arrest. **********Still, the officials say Mr. Lee, who has been the focus of the F.B.I. investigation since 1996, remains a suspect in the Government's investigation of whether China stole technology related to the design of America's most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88. **********Officials say that the Chinese apparently stole the design technology in the 1980's, but that the United States did not detect the theft until 1995. In June 1996, the F.B.I. opened a criminal investigation of the allegations of Chinese atomic espionage, which have been denied by Beijing. **********Mr. Lee was allowed to retain his access to United States nuclear secrets and remain in a highly sensitive job at Los Alamos for more than a year after the bureau urged the Energy Department to cut off his access to classified material and move him to a less sensitive position. **********In interviews with nuclear weapons experts brought in by the bureau to determine whether Mr. Lee had committed espionage, the officials said, Mr. Lee made statements proving that he had violated the security rules at Los Alamos, a lab owned by the Department of Energy. **********Mr. Lee, who did not have a lawyer with him during the questioning, stopped being cooperative on the third day, after The New York Times published an article on the case, the officials said. The F.B.I. then decided that there was no longer any investigative reason to keep Mr. Lee on the job and gave the green light to Mr. Richardson to fire him. **********Since then, the investigation of the theft of nuclear secrets from Los Alamos has stalled, the officials acknowledged. They said they had no other suspects and were uncertain where their investigation could go. **********Mr. Lee, a computer scientist, has retained a lawyer and is no longer providing any information to investigators, the officials added. **********''In this particular case, we don't have anybody saying this is the guy,'' said one senior intelligence official. He said investigators still did not have a clear picture of Mr. Lee's actions. **********''The guy violated some rules and was fired for doing that,'' the official said. ''But we really don't know what his motivations were for doing that. We really don't know enough about what he did. He may have used poor judgment. He may have been persuaded by sentiment or something else to give information he shouldn't have. There are huge unknowns at this point.'' **********In his interviews with the F.B.I., Mr. Lee confirmed some evidence about his travel and contacts with Chinese scientists that had already been gathered by investigators, while also providing information about contacts with Chinese scientists not previously known by the F.B.I. **********The officials declined to provide details about the contacts with Chinese scientists acknowledged by Mr. Lee. But a central focus of the F.B.I.'s questioning was whether he had passed classified information related to how the W-88 warhead is detonated to Chinese scientists during scientific conferences. One such conference occurred in China in 1988, the officials said. **********''The admissions that he made were not things that were against the law, but against D.O.E. regulations,'' said a United States official. ''Some of it was known already and some of it was new, and it gave D.O.E. a stronger cause for termination.'' **********Senior officials say they have decided to start over their investigation. The F.B.I. has added extra agents to the case to review old evidence and try to develop new leads. **********At the same time, United States officials say there is evidence of ongoing Chinese espionage operations aimed at Los Alamos and America's other nuclear weapons laboratories. Officials assert that there is no evidence that those spy efforts have succeeded in stealing more nuclear technology. But the F.B.I. has not been able to develop enough evidence to open full criminal investigations of those activities."

Their bodies did not require any of the usual ritual washing or the cover of a white shroud. They were placed in their graves just as they had fallen, martyrs already ascended into heaven. **********The young men were blown apart in battle by artillery fire a few miles from here. They were not well known, but 2,000 people came to their funeral under a brutal morning sun. Martyrdom is treated quite momentously in this city. The special burial plot lies before the National Assembly and beside the Supreme Court. **********Muzaffarabad is the capital of what is known in Pakistan as Azad, or liberated, Kashmir; the Indians know it as Pakistan-occupied territory. Outside of town, along a route that winds through the breathtaking green of the lower Himalayas, the same hand-lettered words appear again and again on rocky walls beside the road: Martyrdom is our motto. **********As the ''Kargil jihad,'' the two-month war for strategic mountain tops in the area that India controls, was being celebrated in Muzaffarabad, it was being deflated 80 miles away in the Pakistani capital. Fulfilling a pledge made by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif last weekend in Washington, the Government of Pakistan officially appealed to the Mujahedeen, or holy warriors, to end the fighting on the windswept peaks. **********Mr. Sharif had met for two hours with his top military and civilian leaders. Afterward, in a statement, the group asked the militants to pull back to ''provide an opportunity for the international community to play an active role'' in solving the 52-year dispute over Kashmir. Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed Khan emphasized that President Clinton had promised ''to take a personal interest.'' **********The Prime Minister then met with a delegation of Mujahedeen groups. Some later took a wait-and-see attitude while others rebuffed his entreaty outright. ''We don't accept any Washington accord and are not concerned with appeals from the Government of Pakistan,'' said Abdul Ahad, a spokesman for Al-Badr Mujahedeen. **********The funeral in Muzaffarabad itself seemed a flat rejection of Mr. Sharif's proposal. ''We started the holy war based on our trust in God, not the Governments of Pakistan or the United States,'' said Ahmed Hamza of Al-Badr Mujahedeen, addressing the crowd. **********Five of the coffins rested on the ground together. The dead belonged to the group Tehrik-e-Jihad. Dozens of its soldiers in camouflage fatigues and headscarves marched with precision. Before any prayers were recited, speeches were made, amplified through a sound truck. Mourning was secondary to exhortation. **********''By the will of Allah, we will start dozens of Kargils,'' said Saleem Wani, a leader of the Tehrik-e-Jihad. **********A chant began in response. ''God is great!'' **********For weeks, India has been portraying the Mujahedeen as rather feckless rebels being led into battle by Pakistani army regulars. Each day in New Delhi, the military announces a new string of victories and a lopsided death toll. **********In Muzaffarabad, those claims are turned inside out. The Mujahedeen maintain that the holy war is entirely their own, and the Pakistanis mere allies. As for how the fighting is going, they say the Indians are taking a drubbing. **********''If the Indians boasts were truth, the war would be over, wouldn't it?'' said Nazir Hussain Shah, 30, a Mujahedeen soldier on leave. ''We are Kashmiris and these mountains are our homes. We are used to fighting up here. We took those peaks in February, in the most bitter part of winter, and we are completely prepared to stay when winter comes again.'' **********However the Kargil campaign turns out, it would seem the Mujahedeen struggle for Kashmir is destined for a long life. It combines the patriot's love of a land with the religious zealot's sense of righteousness and the oppressed's storehouse of hatred. **********Three of the men buried today -- Mohammad Aslam Shah, Nazir Ahmed Qureshi and Altaf Ahmed Shah -- came from families that had fled Indian Kashmir in 1990 and ended up in the Ambor refugee camp outside Muzaffarabad. **********Ambor, once seen as a stopover, is now a settlement, its 3,000 residents having gouged space out of a mountainside and piled hovel atop hovel. Steep paths, barely two feet wide, divide one row of single-room homes from another. The better-off have tin roofs, but most people live under ill-fitting wooden planks. At any given time, hundreds of the young men are fighting the jihad. Every house has someone who has lost a husband, a child or a limb. **********In Altaf Ahmed Shah's house, grieving uncles and cousins were repeating tales of Indian ''tortures and atrocities'' that had driven them from the village of Karnah Bahadur Kot nine years ago. Noor Ali Shah had embarked on the story of his missing right leg when an old man -- a very old man -- began to shout and ambled in, poking with a cane. **********With skinny legs and a stooped frame, Kapur Ali Shah, who said he was 120 years old, looked like a slowly moving question mark. ''Since 1947, we have been asking for our independence,'' he screamed as people reached to steady him. ''We have asked for it and asked for it and asked for it. We ask for it still!'' **********In 1947, the year that India and Pakistan were carved from the British Empire, the two infant nations went to war over the jeweled land that lay between them. Kashmir, predominantly Muslim, seemed essential to both of their identities -- proof that secular India could accommodate all faiths, and proof that Pakistan was the Islamic homeland for the region. **********A half century and two wars later, Kashmir remains the chief issue that keeps the countries loathing each other. Pakistan controls about a third of Kashmir as a protectorate;  the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir includes most of the rest. **********In 1989, a violent separatist movement shook Indian Kashmir. The Indians blamed the Pakistanis for fomenting the rebellion. The Pakistanis and many human rights groups blamed the Indians for stifling dissent and insurrection in a brutal manner. **********Khanum Jan, the mother of Nazir Ahmed Qureshi, one of those buried today, said she lost another son, her eldest, during the violence in 1990. She has one son left. ''All my boys are willing to die for the struggle,'' she said in a low murmur. **********Mohammad Aslam Shah was also the second son in his family to be ''martyred.'' Maskeen Shah, his father, today recalled what had made him flee to Azad Kashmir. **********''Our women were raped,'' he said. ''They tear-gassed us. They shot at us. The looted our properties. I was tortured with electricity, strung upside down.'' **********He sat cross-legged on the floor and as he talked his lips trembled and his eyes got teary. But he refused to accept condolences. **********''I am a happy man today,'' he insisted. ''The title of martyrdom does not come easily. And I am proud of my son for dying for our cause.'' **********He reached out his left arm and pulled a baby onto his lap. The boy, his grandson, is 5 months old and now fatherless. **********''Soon,'' he said, propping the baby onto his toes and forcing a smile, ''this little one will be ready for jihad.''"

Out!'' as the newly elected member, 31-year-old Merve Kavakci, entered the chamber in Ankara with a navy blue scarf covering her hair and the sides of her face. **********Ms. Kavakci had said her scarf simply reflected her private commitment to Islam, but many Turks consider it an inflammatory provocation. Turkey is strongly secular, and its political and military leaders fiercely resist any religious influence in public affairs. **********Among the angriest members of Parliament was Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who arrived to take his oath after President Suleyman Demirel asked him to form Turkey's next Government. **********''Please put this lady in her place,'' Mr. Ecevit told the acting Speaker of Parliament, Ali Reza Septioglu, after Ms. Kavakci appeared wearing her scarf, as she had said she would. **********Then, in a speech to the assembled members, Mr. Ecevit said: ''No one may interfere with the private life of individuals, but this is not a private space. This is the supreme foundation of the state. It is not a place in which to challenge the state.'' **********After hearing that speech, Mr. Septioglu called for a recess. When it was over, Ms. Kavakci did not return to take her oath with other members of Parliament. As a result, she is not qualified to take part in deliberations. It is unclear whether she will take the oath in the future and if so, under what circumstances. **********Among those watching from a balcony as the tumult began were the chief of the Turkish general staff, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, and several other senior officers. The military is among Turkey's most strongly secular institutions. **********Ms. Kavakci is a member of the religious-oriented Virtue Party, which secularists have denounced as subversive. The party lost nearly one-third of its strength in last month's election, falling from 21 percent of the vote in 1995 to 15 percent. But military commanders and their civilian allies, like Mr. Ecevit, still consider it a serious threat to national unity and stability. **********Newspapers that support Islamic politics rallied to Ms. Kavakci's defense. ''The people want their representatives to repeal laws that restrict freedom of expression,'' one of them, Milli Gazete, said in an editorial. **********The clash in Parliament reflected a profound debate that is spreading through Turkish society. Most members of the political elite believe that restrictions on free expression are necessary to prevent the rise of religious fundamentalism, separatism and other causes they consider hostile to Western values. Others argue that Turkey should be able to tolerate unrestricted political debate, even over highly sensitive issues. **********The oath of office that Ms. Kavakci was prevented from taking includes a vow to uphold the ''principles and reforms of Ataturk.'' Three-quarters of a century ago, the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, decreed reforms that shattered centuries-old traditions. He abolished the sultanate, banned religious brotherhoods, adopted Latin script to replace Arabic and banned the fez, the veil and the head scarf. **********''In some places I have seen women who put a piece of cloth or a towel or something like it over their heads to hide their faces,'' Ataturk said in a 1925 speech. ''Can the mothers and daughters of a civilized nation adopt this strange manner, this barbarous posture? It is a spectacle that makes the nation an object of ridicule. It must be remedied at once.''"

Eludes Israel,Membership In Key Group Within U.N. Eludes Israel," **********A move to admit Israel to a group of European and other nations so it can take part more fully in United Nations activities seems to have stalled because the Europeans cannot muster a consensus, diplomats say. **********Frozen out of its own regional group by Arab animosity, Israel is the only member barred from joining any other such group. The groups' purpose is to nominate countries and delegates to important positions within the organization, including the Security Council. Israel and the United States, backed by a media campaign and lobbying by the American Jewish Committee, had hoped to change that by the end of this General Assembly session. **********''It's not a secret that there is not a consensus in the European Union now,'' said Marjatta Rasi, Finland's United Nations representative, who has led the European Union's contingent here for the last six months. **********Last Friday, when European Union political officials met to try to reach consensus, Spain balked. In earlier discussions Ireland and Italy had reservations, diplomats say. Under European Union rules, all members must agree. Other members are Norway, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Iceland and Turkey. **********Some members are concerned about another country's name on lists already too long to ensure that every country gets a chance to serve in coveted positions. Diplomats said that Israel could be asked to forgo claims on some nominations -- the Security Council first of all. **********Kenneth Bandler, spokesman for the American Jewish Committee, said today that his organization opposed such compromises. Israel, he said, should have equal right to vie for seats on the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the World Court, among other bodies. **********''Our principal concern today is that the European Union reach consensus on giving Israel, on a temporary basis, full membership in Weog,'' Mr. Bandler said in an interview, using the acronym for the Western European and Others Group. By that, he said, the panel means the right to compete across the board ''just like any other member of a regional group, any other member of the United Nations.'' **********Israel has never been accepted by the Asian regional group, which includes the Middle East. Israeli estrangement from the United Nations was at its most complete in 1975, when the General Assembly voted to list Zionism as a form of racism. **********But since the end of the cold war Israel's position has improved. In 1991, during the Bush administration, the United States was able to muster the General Assembly votes to strike down the resolution on Zionism. The revival of peace talks under the government of Ehud Barak has added good will. **********Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States representative to the United Nations, raised the issue when he took over here in late summer. **********Until last week Israel's supporters thought the tide had turned. But the Europeans' inability to reach a consensus last Friday in Brussels has set back those hopes."

''Obviously I am delighted,'' he said after watching the verdict, announced live on national television, in his Senate office in Rome. ''It was not so great to have to wait so many years. I consider the case closed.'' **********The outcome was not entirely unexpected. In a trial in Perugia last September, Mr. Andreotti was acquitted of conspiring in the 1979 murder of a muckraking journalist. In Palermo, as in Perugia, prosecutors relied heavily on the testimony of ''pentiti,'' Mafia members turned cooperative witnesses. The prosecution presented more hearsay than hard evidence. **********But the verdict in Sicily was not quite the full exoneration that Mr. Andreotti won in Perugia, where he was acquitted of committing the crime. Judges in Palermo instead concluded that there was insufficient evidence to convict. In Sicily, where the grip of the Mafia is still felt, that distinction may have reflected suspicions that organized crime could not have thrived so long without some help from the powers-that-be. **********The six-year trial in Palermo, which involved more than 300 witnesses, including 30 cooperative Mafia witnesses, was viewed as Italy's ''trial of the century.'' **********Mr. Andreotti was the power broker of the Christian Democratic Party, which governed Italy for almost 50 years. He remains the personification of a system that disintegrated in the early 90's under the weight of its own corruption. In some ways, Italian society was on trial alongside the former Prime Minister. **********''I am relieved,'' said Sergio Romano, a former ambassador who writes frequent editorials on Italian politics. ''Had he been condemned, the entire country would have been held responsible. It is absolutely impossible to be governed for such a long time by people in collusion with organized crime and not know it. It would have cast a horrible shadow on the entire country.'' **********Now, a shadow is growing over Italian prosecutors, who are under fire for what their critics call politically motivated zeal, and an over-reliance on Mafia witnesses, whose credibility has eroded in recent years. The Sicilian prosecutors failed to prove that Mr. Andreotti had reached a tacit ''pact of power'' with mob-connected local politicians, turning a blind eye to organized crime in exchange for votes. **********The most sensational allegation, that in 1987 Mr. Andreotti traveled secretly to Sicily to meet and exchange a ritual kiss with Salvatore (the Beast) Riina, a top mafia boss who was then a fugitive and is now in jail, also did not hold up. That charge was based on testimony given by Baldassare Di Maggio, a minor Sicilian mobster, who claimed he witnessed the embrace. Mr. Di Maggio himself is now back in jail. **********In the Mafia maxi-trials of the 1980's, ''pentiti'' helped prosecutors capture and convict hundreds of mobsters. But the generous immunity deals many won in exchange for testifying led many critics to charge that Mafia witnesses would say whatever prosecutors wanted. Witness protection programs have proved lax. Several mobsters, including Mr. Di Maggio, managed to kill rivals and commit other crimes while under the program. Both magistrates and their critics agree the law needs to be changed. **********Over the last six years, Mr. Andreotti, who was made a senator for life in 1991, juggled his many court appearances with politics, interceding in parliamentary debates on NATO expansion and the European Union with his usual acerbic verve. **********A slight, stooped man known for his erudition, his cynicism and his cunning, he skillfully brokered alliances that kept the popular Communist Party out of government throughout the cold war. **********A devoted Catholic who courted cardinals and Popes, Mr. Andreotti never lost favor in the Vatican. ''I repeat the satisfaction of the Holy See, which was already expressed over the acquittal in Perugia,'' Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the Vatican spokesman, said today. **********Mr. Andreotti's critics have long portrayed him as a wily, sinister figure. ''There has always been a theory, primarily on the left, that throughout the cold war, Italy was ruled by two states -- a visible government, and an invisible power structure with shady connections to organized crime, secret services, and the C.I.A.,'' Mr. Romano explained. ''Some people will go on believing it, but this verdict is a victory for Mr. Andreotti, and inevitably, a defeat for the other side.''"

The rebels proved themselves maddeningly unpredictable during peace talks last month in Rambouillet, France. **********''I think I will conclude that the agreement has been signed when it's been signed,'' said James P. Rubin, the department spokesman, expressing the wariness of many Administration officials. ''We would want it signed as soon as possible.'' **********With less than a week to go before the scheduled resumption of peace talks in France, the agreement also has not been signed by the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, who insisted again today that he would never accept a settlement that called for the presence of foreign peacekeeping troops in Kosovo. **********If the rebel leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army are true to their word, the decision to sign the accord would allow the United States and its NATO allies to raise the diplomatic and military pressure on President Milosevic, whom they have attempted to paint as the villain in the fighting. **********The State Department said Richard C. Holbrooke, the diplomat who has served as the Administration's principal emissary to the Yugoslav leader, was leaving today for Belgrade to pressure him to join in signing the agreement. **********The department said leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army conveyed their decision to sign the agreement in a meeting with Ambassador Christopher Hill, the American envoy to the region. But almost as soon as the announcement was made in Washington, there was evidence that the guerrillas might not live up to the promises made today. **********The Associated Press said in a report today that it had interviewed a senior rebel commander, Ramush Hajredinaj, and that he had vowed not give up his weapons, a key requirement of the peace plan. Administration officials acknowledged that it was unclear whether another key guerrilla leader, Hashim Thaci, had signed off on the deal. **********''Let me say what we need to do is get the maximum clarity from the Kosovar Albanian side so that we are in a position to put the necessary pressure on the Serbs,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''The point is that until an agreement is signed, it's not signed.'' **********Former Senator Bob Dole, who was sent last week as a White House emissary to the ethnic Albanians, said he spoke by telephone today with one of the Kosovo Liberation Army commanders ''who assured me again that they were going to sign the document.'' **********''I said, well, just sign it, sign,'' he said at a news conference in Denver, where he was delivering a speech to a local business group. ''It's frustrating when you should have signed this in France two weeks ago.'' **********Mr. Holbrooke, who hammered out a cease-fire agreement in Kosovo last fall that has since collapsed, is expected to meet with Mr. Milosevic  on Wednesday. Before leaving Washington, Mr. Holbrooke met at the State Department today with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to discuss tactics in dealing with the Yugoslav leader. **********''Ambassador Holbrooke will convey to the authorities in Belgrade the necessity for full compliance with all of their commitments to the international community and for maximum restraint in the period leading up to the March 15 conference,'' the State Department said in a statement, referring to the planned resumption of peace talks in Paris on Monday. **********Senior Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Holbrooke would remind Mr. Milosevic in forceful terms that the United States and its NATO allies still held out the threat of air strikes against Yugoslav forces if he did not abide by the peace accord or if there were further human rights abuses by his troops. **********The Yugoslav leader has continued to object strenuously to the main element of the plan, the deployment of 28,000 NATO-led peacekeepers to Kosovo, including 4,000 American soldiers. The official Yugoslav news agency quoted him today as saying that any accord for Kosovo must ''exclude foreign troops.'' **********But the Administration has said that the presence of a NATO military force is non-negotiable, a viewpoint also expressed today by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain during a ceremony in London to mark the 50th anniversary of NATO. **********J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, announced that he had scheduled a debate in the House this week on whether American troops should be included in a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. **********''It has become increasingly clear that the President is planning to send approximately 4,000 U.S. troops to Kosovo in support of a negotiated interim agreement,'' Mr. Hastert said in a letter to House members. ''I have admitted frankly to the President and his senior advisers that I have reservations regarding the wisdom of deploying additional U.S. troops to the former Yugoslavia.'' **********More Fighting Reported **********PRISTINA, Serbia, March 8 (AP) -- Mortar and small-arms fire broke out in Kosovo province along the Macedonian border today. **********The Kosovo Liberation Army said the fighting started at dawn around Kacanik, near the Serbian province's border with Macedonia. Observers with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, who are monitoring the cease-fire signed last October, reported hearing mortar and small-arms fire from a distance. **********One of their spokesmen said detonations could be heard from four villages that are believed to be rebel strongholds.

They have been making offers and countering each other for the last three months, the executive said. The chairman of Conde Nast, S. I. Newhouse Jr., has offered $650 million for the Fairchild group, said the Disney executive, who also reported that a team of Hearst accountants had been working on the deal with particular zeal for the last two weeks. **********Conde Nast, a division of Advance Publications, is the publisher of Vogue, Allure and Glamour, among other titles; Hearst Magazines, a unit of the Hearst Corporation, publishes Harper's Bazaar and Town & Country. **********Disney has wrestled with the issue of whether to sell Fairchild since 1995, when Disney -- which has never been a traditional magazine publisher -- acquired Capital Cities/ABC, then the longtime parent company of Fairchild Publications. In 1997, Disney even announced a decision to sell the division, then retracted it a week later. **********But Disney has been under pressure recently from Wall Street to sell nonstrategic assets and revive its core business. The company has already sold some noncore assets acquired in the Capital Cities deal. In April 1997, Disney sold four newspapers that it had acquired in the deal -- including The Kansas City Star and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram -- to Knight-Ridder for $1.65 billion. That same year, Disney sold the trade publisher Chilton to the British-Dutch company Reed Elsevier for $447 million and Institutional Investor Inc. to Euromoney Publications for $142 million. **********The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday that Disney was said to be considering a sale of its Anaheim Angels baseball team and its Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey team. **********The Fairchild group, in addition to mainstream titles like Los Angeles and W, publishes a stable of trade magazines including Women's Wear Daily, Supermarket News, Brand Marketing, Footwear News and Children's Business. It is not clear how Conde Nast or Hearst would use these titles if either company acquired them. **********The jewel of the acquisition for either Hearst or Conde Nast would be W, an oversized glossy fashion monthly that has evolved from a narrow trade title to a mainstream general-interest magazine over the last four years, passing the Hearst-owned Harper's Bazaar in advertising pages and revenue in 1998 by a huge margin. **********W has taken apparel advertising from magazines at both Hearst and Conde Nast, advertising revenue that both companies would prefer to have on their own bottom line. In 1998, W had 2,005 advertising pages, while Harper's Bazaar had only 1,542. Vogue, which is owned by Conde Nast, led the field with 2,681 pages of advertising last year, and in second place, with 2,068 pages, was Elle, published by the Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines unit of Lagardere Group. **********In 1994, W generated $33.5 million in advertising revenue for Fairchild, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, and by 1998 that figure had increased to $87.6 million. **********Hearst Magazines clearly wants to make the acquisition, said an executive involved in the negotiations. The company recently announced its intent to sell Sports Afield and Motor Boating & Sailing in a shift toward less niche-oriented and more popular titles. In addition, it recently announced a deal to publish Oprah, a life-style magazine with Oprah Winfrey as brand spokeswoman. Earlier this year, Hearst Magazines also joined a division of Disney, Miramax Films, in a venture to publish Talk, the magazine edited by Tina Brown. The first issue arrived on newsstands last week. **********David J. Londoner, an analyst at Schroder Inc. who follows Disney, said the sale made sense because Fairchild did not fit Disney's corporate strategy. ''Virtually everything Disney does reinforces everything else they do,'' he said. ''And Fairchild is kind of out in left field.'' **********Because Disney earnings are down, ''the company is refocusing and will undoubtedly go through some organizational changes over the next year or so,'' Mr. Londoner said. ''This could well be part of it.'' Disney stock has fallen 12.9 percent so far this year. **********Hearst already has several affiliations with Disney. Hearst television stations are affiliates of ABC, which is owned by Disney, and Hearst owns 20 percent of ESPN, of which ABC owns the balance. Hearst also owns a small piece of ESPN magazine. And ABC and Hearst are investors in two cable services: Lifetime and Arts and Entertainment. The Hearst Corporation's chief financial officer, Ronald J. Doerfler, was chief financial officer of Capital Cities and is thoroughly acquainted with the Fairchild properties. **********Chris Castro, a spokeswoman for Disney, and Deborah Shriver, a spokeswoman for Hearst, both declined to comment. Michael F. Coady, the president and chief executive of Fairchild Publications, did not return phone calls seeking comment. Nor did Steven T. Florio, the chief executive of Conde Nast. Maurie Perl, a spokeswoman for Conde Nast, said, ''We have no comment on acquisitions.''"

But I.B.M. soared in after-hours trading, gaining more than $17 to $189.375. **********Analysts said that I.B.M.'s results, coupled with the Microsoft Corporation's strong performance on Tuesday, should counter the gloomy outlook painted for technology makers this quarter after the Compaq Computer Corporation predicted, and delivered, half the earnings forecast and the Intel Corporation reported sales growth that was less than expected. **********''This is just what the tech doctor ordered,'' said John B. Jones Jr., an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. I.B.M.'s service business, intellectual property and distribution put it in a different class than Compaq, he said. **********''Compaq has many of the same pieces, but not the same quality,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Compaq addresses the world from a PC-centric standpoint. I.B.M. addresses it from a customer-service standpoint.'' **********Though some analysts said I.B.M.'s better-than-expected results reflected the company's ability to manage expectations, they also pointed to a growing division between leaders and laggards in the technology industries. I.B.M. has been able to position traditional strengths in data base management software and large servers as essential tools for electronic commerce. **********The company's huge consulting practice is also riding the Internet wave as customers rush to offer good and services on the World Wide Web. **********Other computer companies that have established a strong Internet identity, like Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems, also reported stronger-than-expected results this quarter. **********Sun's shares have fallen, however, after the company warned that sales might slow in the second half of the year if companies defer technology purchases because of Year 2000 concerns. That same warning was issued in an extremely strong earnings report on Tuesday by Microsoft, and its stock also closed down slightly yesterday. **********For the quarter, I.B.M. reported earnings of roughly $1.47 billion, or $1.55 a diluted share, up nearly 42 percent from $1.04 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent, to $8.58 billion, from $7.32 billion in the first quarter of 1998. **********Per-share figures reflect a decrease in the average number of shares outstanding, to 911.9 million compared with 950.2 million in the first quarter of 1998. I.B.M. spent approximately $2.1 billion on share repurchases in the first quarter, up from $1.6 billion in the final quarter of 1998. **********Analysts expected I.B.M. to earn $1.41 a share, according to First Call, which tracks such estimates. It was the 12th consecutive quarter in which I.B.M. has exceeded estimates. **********''We started 1999 with a strong quarter,'' Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ''We saw a significant improvement in our business in Asia, and we also had double-digit revenue growth in Europe and the Americas. Services is clearly the largest and fastest-growing portion of the information technology industry, and we continue to extend our leadership position each quarter.'' **********I.B.M. said sales in the Americas increased 13 percent, to $8.8 billion; in Europe, the Middle East and Africa by 20 percent, to $6.3 billion; and in the Asia-Pacific region, 20 percent, to $3.5 billion. **********Hardware sales were up 17 percent, services were up 19 percent, and software up 10 percent. The company said it signed $9.8 billion in services contracts in the first quarter and concluded the quarter with a total services contract backlog around $55 billion. **********In a telephone conference call with securities analysts, Douglas Maine, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said that personal computer sales were up 50 percent, a ''significant improvement.'' However, I.B.M. continues to lose money on PC sales, which contributed to an overall decline in the company's gross profit margin. **********In response to analysts' questions about slowing growth for information technology in the second half of the year, possibly due to Year 2000 issues, Mr. Maine said he did not see that. ''There's an absence of anything we're hearing from customers that suggests a slowdown,'' he said, adding that ''the I.T. sector in 1999 will continue to be the key driver'' of worldwide growth in economic output."

Walker, the Priceline founder and vice chairman, about a year ago, when she was delivering a speech on the auto industry. He invited her to visit Priceline's offices. ''Why not?'' she thought. She was impressed. **********Months later, when she decided to leave Wall Street, she called Priceline. ''Fifteen minutes later Jay called back,'' she said, and she joined Priceline's management, now led by Richard S. Braddock, the former Citicorp president. **********At Priceline, where 20-somethings bustle through the halls wearing baseball caps and tennis shoes, she's one of a handful of grown-ups. And one of the few grandparents: Ms. Keller, with three grown children and four grandchildren, is married to Jay W. Chai, chief executive of the American branch of a giant Japanese trading company, Itochu International. A native of Perth Amboy, N.J., she majored in chemistry at Rutgers and earned her M.B.A. from the Bernard Baruch School of the City University of New York. **********Her new job at Priceline has clearly meant a new approach. Ask how many cars Priceline has sold, and Ms. Keller won't say. ''I can't tell you that, but I can tell you it is heartwarming,'' she said with a smile. **********A second plea is firmly refused. ''I used to be so frustrated when people would say, 'I can't tell you the numbers,' '' Ms. Keller said. ''I have to play the other side of the analyst's chair now.'' **********Priceline began brokering auto sales this spring, and Ms. Keller is busy with the nationwide expansion. At first, only customers in the New York area could bid for cars. Last summer, the bidding was extended to California, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with most of the rest of New England due to be added by year-end. **********Priceline makes money as a broker; customers bid for vehicles online and agree to pay the Web site $50 if they buy. Priceline forwards the bids to nearby dealers, who pay it $200 if the lead turns into a sale. **********Although Priceline is growing rapidly, it is still a money-losing Internet start-up. In 21 months of operations, Priceline has built a customer base of 2.9 million; the travel unit is by far the company's largest. **********For the auto unit, some of Ms. Keller's old contacts have proved helpful. Ford announced last month that it would direct some Web site users who look up prices to try Priceline, where they can bid. The link will be tested in Florida, then may be expanded. **********Analysts who follow e-tailing hailed the move as evidence of Priceline's appeal. ''Priceline's ability to partner with a formidable supply partner such as Ford this early in the development of its car-buying service points to the growing demand,'' Lauren Cooks Levitan, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, wrote recently. She called the agreement a ''win-win-win'' for Priceline, car buyers and Ford. **********Will Ms. Keller's contacts help her with other car companies? For years, she was a bear on G.M., the subject of her scathing 1989 book, ''Rude Awakening'' (William Morrow). But the redesigned Maryann Keller is hopeful. ''I don't think the well is poisoned,'' she said. She had criticized G.M. for its weak sales. ''I'm in a different place now, and I can help them sell cars.''"

But on July 14, Mannesmann said it had pulled out of the bidding because One2One's asking price -- believed to be about $17 billion -- was too high. **********One2One had also discussed the prospect of an initial public offering. **********Deutsche Telekom has also talked with France Telecom and the Sprint Corporation, the long-distance and local communications provider, about potentially dissolving Global One, the troubled international joint venture backed by the three companies. **********Those discussions have included negotiations about splitting up Global One's assets, said an executive close to the talks. **********Deutsche Telekom's role in the Global One joint venture has been troubled for some time.

Deutsche Telekom, said an executive who spoke on condition of anonymity, is still trying to decide whether to start a single splashy deal, like a bid for Sprint, or to embark on a series of smaller acquisitions. **********News of a possible acquisition of Sprint and the possible sale of One2One to Deutsche Telekom were reported in the German daily newspaper Handelsblatt. **********The newspaper also said, citing an unnamed Telekom source, that the company was in preliminary talks with America Online Inc., the Microsoft Corporation and Qwest Communications International. **********Qwest last week announced a $35 billion merger with the regional Bell company U S West.

Mine the Salt? Mexican Standoff,Laguna San Ignacio Journal; Save the Whales? Mine the Salt? Mexican Standoff," **********At nightfall, when the winds die down and the waters become glassy, sounds like deep sighs come gliding across this lagoon. They are the echoes of the gray whales breathing, spouting and diving, carried easily to the beach on the pure, still air from hundreds of yards offshore. **********Quiet as the scene is, this sheltered bay and the lunar landscape of natural salt flats surrounding it have become the center of a noisy clash. The fight pits an international environmental movement against a mega-conglomerate, the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, which hopes to build a huge salt plant nearby in partnership with the Mexican Government. **********At stake are core goals for both sides. Mitsubishi and Mexico's Commerce Ministry, which already own another salt plant at a bay up the coast, are determined to show that they can develop a new industry without threatening pristine natural resources. **********For environmentalists the salt plant is a test of their collective power to defend a few corners of the earth they regard as sacred. San Ignacio Lagoon, which cuts into a spectacular untamed desert on the Pacific Coast of the Baja California peninsula, provides a rare refuge that gray whales seek each winter to breed after an odyssey from summer feeding grounds near the Bering Strait. **********''There are so few places left that clearly belong to nature,'' said Jacob Scherr, a director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a United States group that has been leading the fight against the salt plant. ''Shouldn't they be truly beyond the reach of human beings?'' **********This is no simple case of a multinational corporation caught ravaging the backlands by intrepid nature lovers. On both sides the campaign for San Ignacio is global and sophisticated. Each side has videos, Web sites, letter-writing campaigns and guided tours to promote its views. Top scientists have been recruited by each faction and are divided on the issues. **********But then San Ignacio is not just any lagoon. It is part of El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, created by the Mexican Government in 1988 as the largest protected natural area in Latin America. In 1994, also on Mexico's initiative, the reserve was declared a United Nations World Heritage Site, making it one of the few natural areas to come under the wing of the world organization. **********The $100 million salt plant that Mitsubishi and the Mexican Government want to build would cover 62,000 acres of the reserve and match the existing one, a solar evaporation plant, as the largest of its kind in the world. **********Key decisions in the four-year-old dispute are due to be made this year. During the summer the salt company, named Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V., will publish a two-year study it commissioned, at a cost of at least $1 million, on the environmental impact of the proposed plant. **********An international committee of scientists appointed by the Mexican Government will decide whether to approve the study. Based on their conclusions, the Environment Secretary, Julia Carabias, will determine whether to give the go-ahead for construction. **********In 1998 environmentalists petitioned the United Nations to declare that Mexico was threatening its World Heritage Site by even considering the plant. A United Nations mission is expected to visit the area in coming weeks. **********Mitsubishi officials acknowledge that they are edgy about the environmentalists' campaign, which has inundated their offices with 650,000 protest letters and is symbolized by the gray whale, an unusually affable 45-foot-long marine mammal that was removed only five years ago from the endangered species list. **********Mitsubishi owns 49 percent of the salt company and the Mexican Government 51 percent. **********''Certainly we don't enjoy being in the spotlight,'' said James Brumm, an executive vice president of the American subsidiary of Mitsubishi. ''But the way our people look at it is that we haven't made a decision to do anything yet except look at the environmental impact of the proposed project. We have pledged not to go ahead if it will harm the environment.'' **********Yet Mitsubishi and Mexican executives of the salt company leave no doubt that they are playing to win. The current plant, in the town of Guerrero Negro, is aging and cannot be modernized to achieve large increases in its output. The company, already supplying 50 percent of Japan's demand for industrial salt, envisions an exploding market in other Asian countries in coming decades. **********For every complaint that environmentalists have lodged, company engineers have reshaped the proposed plant's design. Instead of using enormous diesel-powered wagons to move salt, as is now done in Guerrero Negro, a conveyor belt will carry it for miles through the desert to a new port the company will build far from the lagoon's mouth. Brine, a byproduct that can be lethal to wildlife, will be diluted and piped out to the sea. **********''It will have nothing to do with the lagoon,'' insisted Juan Bremer, the director general of the salt company. ''There are no smokestacks. We're making salt from natural flats that have been there for a thousand years. When we fill them we make wetlands. We make life. It even looks beautiful.'' **********For the moment it appears that the company has even fought the environmentalists to a draw on the most conspicuous issue, the well-being of the whales. Although there was a decline this season, in previous years the number of gray whales in the bay around the existing plant has reached new highs. **********But the salt company is dogged by a checkered track record. Last year Mexican inspectors found 298 batteries littered across the bottom of the Guerrero Negro bay. Reporters who took the official tour of the salt plant recently were led past a dead whale beached near a seawater intake canal, whose presence seemed to be of no concern to company officials. **********Enforcement of environmental regulations by the Mexican Government has been abysmal. When 94 sea turtles turned up dead near Guerrero Negro in 1997, Government inspectors first blamed the company, then changed their minds after company officials intervened. The sandy road to San Ignacio is lined with mounds of scallop and hatchet clam shells. **********Local fishermen told how outsiders used bribes to buy illegal licenses to fish for the mollusks, then plundered the entire crop to extinction in four years. **********The most serious problem the company could create in San Ignacio is beyond anyone's control: the potential proliferation of Homo sapiens. Today, Guerrero Negro, which was a vacant desert outpost when the plant was founded in the 1950's, is a shabby company town of 13,000 people. Although the company keeps its grounds neat, a trail of plastic bottles and old tires winds from the town center into the bay. **********Environmentalists acknowledge that they may have overplayed the whales to draw attention to the risks to the whole area. **********''You just don't see T-shirts that say, 'Save the Benthic Worm,' '' said Chris Peterson, a marine mammal specialist who leads whale-watching trips in San Ignacio Lagoon. But the whales may yet tip the balance in the debate. The scientists who are examining the impact on them, which will last well into the next century, are dealing with many imponderables. **********''We don't really know that much about them,'' said David Gordon, a naturalist who has written a field guide to gray whales. Experts are not certain, for example, how the whales navigate down the Pacific Coast or know when they have reached the Baja breeding lagoons. **********Nor is anyone sure why the big grays will sometimes ease up alongside a skiff full of whale-watchers in San Ignacio Lagoon and gently lift their eight-foot-long heads out of the water to be stroked and kissed, an astonishing gesture of peace between species. **********The heart of the argument over San Ignacio is not about facts, but about something unquantifiable: the mystical appeal of its uninterrupted desert horizon and harmonious wildlife. **********''When there is a demand for product and you have to develop, someone can say that any site in the world is unique,'' said Mr. Brumm, the Mitsubishi executive. ''San Ignacio is beautiful, but there is nothing unique about it.'' **********Homero Aridjis, the Mexican poet turned environmental activist who was the first to protest the salt plant plans, disagreed. ''What we are defending,'' he said, ''is the right of this species to exist in a poetic world, to live in paradise.''"

He could easily buy it on the street, on the black market, but for 18 dinars a liter, two and a half times more. In fact, at the very end of the line, a street-wise entrepreneur had set up a stand to sell gas at that price. **********But these days, Mr. Krika said, ''my time is less expensive than the money.'' His business is doing well enough, because he repairs and alters clothes more than creates them. In the deep recession that has followed NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia, he said, ''people want money in their pockets now more than they want new pockets.'' **********Does it make him angry to wait in line for gas in Europe at the end of the 20th century? He smiled, a mix between sheepishness and indulgence for the naive assumptions of the foreigner. ''It's part of life here these days,'' he said. ''Everyone knows the problems. The refineries were bombed. You can get angry as much as you like, but where does that get you?'' **********Like most Belgraders, Mr. Krika wants political change and an end to Yugoslavia's isolation. He is upset about the loss of Kosovo, and he would like President Slobodan Milosevic, whom he supported until two years ago, to leave office. But Mr. Krika, who has little respect for the current crop of opposition leaders, is not about to die to make it happen, ''to let one hungry gang take over from another that's already eaten.'' **********Mr. Jovanovic, presiding over the opening of his bar, Pingvin, a companion to his restaurant Duga, is not much happier. He is taking a risk, he acknowledges, because even the normal restaurant crowd is spending less. **********During the 78-day bombing war, Belgrade seemed almost normal in the daytime, with restaurants and coffee bars jammed until about 4 P.M., when there was an eerie exodus for home, before the air raid alerts, lightless streets and thudding detonations. **********On these hot summer nights, Belgrade seems back to its old, Italianate habits, people pouring out of their apartments to hit the restaurants, clubs and bars from 9 P.M. until the early hours. Most people have replaced their broken windows and roof tiles and cleaned the shards of glass from their courtyards, where their children play. **********But economists say that incomes are down at least 40 percent in real terms, that people's savings are becoming depleted and that many have not been paid their salaries or pensions since mid-March. **********Mr. Jovanovic complains that people are ordering less. ''People sit for four hours over two drinks,'' he said. ''During the war it was almost better. Now people don't have any money, and the taxes, if they catch you, are incredible. It hasn't been like this for 20 years.'' **********Usually, he said, a bar owner can clear 30 percent of the receipts, ''but now, it's like a joke.'' **********''There's nothing for the owner, but we give two-thirds for Marko and Marija,'' he said, referring to the two children of Mr. Milosevic and his powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic. **********What Mr. Jovanovic really means, of course, are taxes, including some new postwar levies for ''reconstruction.'' But his comments reflect the common urban mood about Yugoslavia's First Family in this soft authoritarianism, where people generally speak as they please. **********Friendship is still the prime virtue here. ''People like to go to the bars even without money,'' Mr. Jovanovic said. ''Old friends come to chat and drink, and I can't charge them full price or I put it on the tab.'' **********''I've got 15,000 DM tied up in tabs,'' he said, referring to German marks worth about $8,800. ''But how can I go into someone's house these days and take money away from their kids?'' **********Especially with the winter coming. As Belgrade went through an unseasonably chilly few days of rain last week, people started to worry openly about this postwar winter, when a city that largely heats itself with electricity expects to have serious difficulties. **********The real-estate ads now highlight amenities like chimneys and wood-burning stoves rather than marble bathtubs and all-electric kitchens. **********Ljubica Markovic, the chief editor of the independent Beta news agency, said she knew there was trouble when a large generator was delivered to her building for the new apartment of Serbia's Prime Minister, Mirko Marjanovic. ''It's a sign they might be expecting bad times,'' she said dryly. **********In Smederevo, the manager of the town's electricity plant went out to buy a coal- and wood-burning stove for his family, apparently to impress upon the town, known for its stoves, the difficulties to come. **********Outside an electrical supply store here, on the sidewalk, is a tinny little stovepipe, about 3 feet high, to burn wood or coal, for 514 dinars, about $50. Inside, there is a more impressive wood-burning oven, enameled in different colors, for about $400. Zoran Przulj, 35, says he has sold 20 already and expects to sell a lot more, and he offers a three-month payment plan. **********''People are preparing themselves,'' he said. ''People expect a bad winter.'' **********Ironically, perhaps, the last time such stoves were so popular in a Balkan city was during the Bosnian war in Sarajevo, starved of electricity and gas supplies during the 3 1/2-year siege and bombardment by Bosnian Serbs. **********But to use a stove, you need ventilation. In Novi Beograd, or New Belgrade, where hundreds of thousands of people live, the apartment buildings were not constructed with chimneys or much storage space for wood. In older Belgrade, many younger people tossed out the wood-burning stoves that kept their parents warm during World War II. **********And then there are those like Branislav Bondzic, 29, his wife Maja, 26, and their daughter Milica, 5. Their building was built with a chimney, but it is now useless. A few years ago, the owner of the apartment two floors above ripped out the flue to build himself a wet bar. **********Mr. Bondzic shrugged. He has electric radiators and a stove that can also use bottled gas, so he has bought a few canisters. If it gets really cold, he said, he will send the family to his parents' house in a village near Obrenovac, 25 miles away, where there is plenty of wood and food, two pigs and kind neighbors. **********His grandfather was a World War II Partisan who lost most of his wealth, but was given a few fields around his house. There, they still preserve pork in the ''vajat,'' or smokehouse, or lay it in cold storage, in the ground, packed with layers of pork fat and grasses. **********''Usually when we kill the pigs, we sold the fat, but not this year,'' Mr. Bondzic said. ''We need it.'' Anyway, he said, ''when it's grilled, the taste is wonderful -- in the freezer, it loses all taste.'' **********Many Belgraders have connections to the countryside, or to friends and relatives working abroad, who send in extra cash, or both. Those who do not have such ties find them. During Yugoslavia's hyperinflation in the winter of 1993, for instance, the employees of the liberal magazine Vreme got together and bought two pigs, which they slaughtered, preserved and shared. **********Potatoes are also going into cold storage, while nearly every family in Serbia spends at least part of the summer cooking and preserving vegetables -- the peppers, eggplants, onions and so on that fill the green markets now at 30 cents a pound. **********Even city dwellers pile up the jars and cans for storage, and when they share with neighbors, make sure they get the jars back again. **********Still, at Zeleni Venac market here, shoppers were complaining about the price of eggs, with the large size costing 2 dinars or about 20 cents apiece. ''I tell them the price of chicken feed and gasoline are up,'' Ivanka Tankosic said matter of factly. ''Two eggs and bread is still the cheapest dinner.'' **********Mrs. Tankosic, 65, has been working in the market for 15 years. ''It will be a hard winter, and people will suffer, like during the war,'' she said. ''Shoes are the most important thing. Buy them three sizes too big and then put on two pairs of thick socks.'' **********She, too, would like things to change at the top, but she sees no magic bullet. **********''We never know where we are,'' she said. ''Everyone wants everything to be better. But how, and where, and what it is exactly, no one knows.''"

The majority view was that high stock prices probably reflect not a bubble but the economy's actual strength, although no one said that categorically. **********''Is it a bubble?'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. ''If the people here really thought this was a bubble market about to crash, that would have been a big topic of conversation at this meeting.'' **********A bubble, if one exists, raises the odds that stock prices will eventually plunge and extinguish the wealth of millions of shareholders. They will respond by pulling back suddenly on their spending, damaging the economy. The Asian economic crisis raised concern that the market might be ignoring danger and thus in bubble territory. The spectacular run-up in the share prices of some high-technology companies also fed talk of a bubble market. **********But the bubble talk largely disappeared after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times late last year. That action convinced many on Wall Street -- and also many of the economists gathered in Manhattan -- that the Fed stood ready to sustain the expansion, and stock prices, by cutting rates again if necessary. **********''There is a sense now that if this is a bubble and it bursts, the Fed will lower interest rates and everything will be fine,'' Mr. Mankiw said. ''Many economists have confidence in Alan Greenspan as the Fed's chairman.'' **********In the minds of many economists, the stock market serves mainly as a gauge of the real economy and a stimulus for spending. What accounts much more for the strong economy, in this view, is the happy combination since 1995 of four factors: robust job creation, rising output, falling unemployment and minimal inflation. Usually the first three produce a rise in the fourth, the inflation rate. The Federal Reserve then raises interest rates to subdue inflation by slowing the economy, and the expansion ends or becomes much less vigorous. **********This time, inflation has not risen, as it so often did in the past, particularly when the unemployment rate dropped below 5.5 percent. It is now 4.4 percent. **********And the reasons? Considerable credit went to ''lucky shocks,'' as Alan Blinder of Princeton University phrased it -- falling oil prices, for example, falling import prices, smaller-than-expected increases in health care costs and ever sharper declines in computer prices. **********''There is absolutely no reason to predict that these favorable supply shocks will continue over the next year or two,'' said James Stock of Harvard. **********But structural changes might be more enduring, allowing perhaps for a jobless rate of less than 5 percent without a rise in inflation. The growing use of part-time and temporary workers may help to explain the combination of low unemployment and minimal upward pressure on labor costs and prices, Mr. Stock said. Greater labor mobility may play a role, as well as job insecurity and the aging of the baby boomers. Older workers are less inclined to leave a job. Or so the reasoning went. **********Only Edmund Phelps of Columbia University argued that the rising stock market played a leading role in driving the current expansion.

https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/18/business/personal-business-in-internet-spinoffs-where-should-the-riches-fall.html,Sholnn Freeman,1999-07-18,Companies offer variety of views on dilemma over whether to limit potentially huge stock benefits to unit employees and managers in initial public stock offerings in Internet spinoffs; photos; chart (M),770,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"In Internet Spinoffs, Where Should the Riches Fall?","PERSONAL BUSINESS; In Internet Spinoffs, Where Should the Riches Fall?"," **********AS companies plan to sell shares in their Internet operations to the public, they face a quandary: whether to limit the potentially huge stock benefits in the spinoff to the unit's employees or managers, or to share the wealth throughout the company. **********The first solution helps keep the Internet staff from leaving to join start-up companies that have their own stock benefits. The second helps keep others in the company from feeling cheated -- especially if the Internet operation distributes work they created. **********Experts and consultants generally advise companies to concentrate on attracting and keeping  the best Internet managers, instead of worrying about perceptions of fairness. In practice, though, companies facing the decision often try to keep everybody at least a little happy. **********Many public companies are considering Internet spinoffs -- usually selling only a portion of the shares to the public -- because of investors' passion for these issues. **********When about 18 percent of Barnesandnoble.com, owned by Barnes & Noble and Bertelsmann A.G., was sold to the public in May, Barnes & Noble employees who already owned stock through an existing benefits plan had the opportunity to buy the spinoff's shares at the offering price of $18. (It closed on Friday at $19.1875.) As part of their compensation, many employees of Barnesandnoble.com have received stock options over the last two years for as little as a quarter of the offering price. But like parents trying to discourage jealousies among children, Barnes & Noble executives vigorously discouraged comparisons of the benefits their employees received. **********The privately held Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest media companies, decided not to give its employees a similar plan for Barnesandnoble.com. **********But apart from the spinoff, Bertelsmann decided this month to give 550 senior managers throughout the company ''virtual shares,'' redeemable for cash in five years. Eighty percent of the shares' value will depend on performance of the managers' own operations; the remainder will depend on performance of the whole company, including gains in value from future spinoffs. **********Erik Engstrom, president of Random House Inc., a Bertelsmann unit, is one of the plan's designers and participants. He called it an improvement over a previous plan that offered the parent company's managers no rewards for a spinoff's success. Now, he said, ''people who had no ability to participate can.'' **********Several other companies -- media concerns in particular -- are facing or are likely to face similar questions over how to share the Web's wealth. Among them is Walt Disney. It announced on Tuesday that it would create a single business, Go.com, combining its Internet holdings with Infoseek, the search service. Shares tracking the performance of Go.com could then be used to make acquisitions or to attract Internet managers, whom Disney has had trouble keeping. Disney has not decided how it will distribute stock benefits. **********Microsoft said last week that it was looking at issuing shares that track its Internet operations, and Forbes Inc. is exploring the possibility of an initial public offering of Forbes.com. One person at Forbes, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said employees have been told informally that they would share the benefits. ''Everyone at Forbes has contributed to the success of Forbes.com, and that fact will be reflected were an offering to occur,'' this person said. **********Compensation consultants say that large, established companies too concerned about fairness will be at a disadvantage relative to independent Internet start-ups. **********''If companies set out to prevent hurt feelings, then they will fail to create a rich-enough package to attract top-notch talent,'' said David R. Brodwin, a compensation specialist for Andersen Consulting. **********Thomas Middelhoff, chairman and chief executive of Bertelsmann, does not see  those goals as mutually exclusive. **********Bertelsmann, with projected revenues of $18.5 billion this year, has operations including Bantam Doubleday Dell, RCA Records, Arista Records and Family Circle and McCall's magazines. Mr. Middlehoff said he hoped to take as many as five Internet divisions public in the next three years. He has cited Springer-Verlag, which publishes technical and medical journals on paper and on line, as a likely spinoff candidate, with plans to expand its Internet business. **********Internet spinoffs are essential to the company, he said, because the parent, long privately held, has no proceeds from an offering of its own with which to make acquisitions or reward employees. **********Mr. Middelhoff added that the plan for virtual shares was in keeping with the company's philosophy of high salaries and fairness. And, he said, he wants to avoid creating two manager classes: the wealthy and the disgruntled: ''As Bertelsmann is split into two elements -- the core business and the Internet start-ups -- we are asking, 'What does it mean for executives who work for the core business?''"

''The authorities are not bothering to keep families united. People are being separated on to different buses and they do not want to be separated.'' **********''There is great anxiety,'' he added. ''They now do not want to leave the camp because they do not know where they will be sent.'' **********At the airport Monday evening a man carrying a baby was following his wife and two other children on to one bus, only to have the door slammed in his face and the way barred by a policeman. **********The woman's screams could be heard as the bus pulled away toward a waiting plane. The man, bewildered, kept asking where they were going. No one told him. **********Several hundred refugees left for Turkey, and 91 for Norway, on Monday. Hundreds more followed today. Six busloads of refugees were driven into Skopje airport at midafternoon today to board a plane to Turkey. Policemen wearing hygienic masks and surgical gloves surrounded the buses as the refugees emerged. **********More planes were lined up on the tarmac and the transport of hundreds more was expected to carry on through the night, the police said. **********Some of the refugees, ethnic Turks, talked through the bus windows and said they were going willingly. But others said that they had been forced to go by the police and that they did not even know where they were headed. **********The confusion ran even to patients the doctors were evacuating to the  hospital. ''We have sent out sick people to get them to hospital,'' Dr. Micheletti said. ''The people carrying them out said they were put on buses, not ambulances. They may have been taken to other camps or the airport, we do not know.'' **********The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Ljubco Georgievski, railed at criticism that his authorities were transporting refugees against their will straight from the border to planes bound for Turkey. **********He also accused European countries and the United States of not helping his country cope with the enormous flood of refugees. **********''It was necessary for Macedonia to take in 50,000 refugees before we received the first packet of juice or tent from the West,'' he said at a  news conference in Skopje. **********He admitted that closing the border had been aimed at goading the West into action. ''It took the State Security Council to announce that the border was closed for the international community to realize something dramatic was happening in Macedonia and change their policy.'' **********Nevertheless he denied that refugees were being sent away against their will, or without being told of their destination. Yet his determination to send the remaining refugees stuck at the border to other countries was clear. ''As fast as other countries take the refugees, so the problem will be completed,'' he said. **********Ramona Sunderwirth, a midwife from the United States branch of  Doctors of the World, said the fear whipped up by lack of information and the rumor mill was one of the worst problems. **********''Refugees are very traumatized by the lack of information,'' she said. ''They come up and ask all the time 'What is going to happen to us? What does going abroad mean, does it mean never going home?' '' **********One report circulating among the refugees is that on Monday some 300 to 400 cars, still waiting to cross into Macedonia from Kosovo, were ordered back home to Pristina by the Serbian police. **********Some diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they were aware that a line of waiting cars had dispersed. **********Reached by telephone in Pristina today, a young man who said that he spent days trying to get to Macedonia in a convoy of 10 cars with his parents and brother, said that his family had been ordered back from the border by the police on Monday. The family was just at the barrier and two cars had passed through when the rest were suddenly ordered back, he said. **********The young man, who asked to be identified only as Etrit, said that he thought the sudden turnaround could have been a stunt for the press, connected with the announcement by President Slobodan of Yugoslavia that all Kosovo Albanians could return to their homes. **********And those who do return will find the Serbs are ruling by intimidation, said Kushtriun Hoxha, a drama student who left Pristina for Macedonia with hundreds of others by train on Monday. The police in Pristina have  announced that they will shoot on sight anyone who walks alone in the streets, he said. Only women are allowed to go out shopping for bread, and ethnic Albanian men spend the entire day and night inside their apartments, he said. **********''I never went out in 12 days,'' he said. ''Everyone is just sitting terrified in their homes, or are moving from home to home every day to avoid the police.'' **********They and their neighbors finally decided to flee after NATO bombs hit a building very close to their apartment in the Sunny Hill district of the city. ''The whole building rocked and shook,'' he said."

He did nothing so boorish as gloat; in fact, he barely dared to celebrate. But I ended things anyway. Perhaps I'm revealing more about my ego than is wise in a national publication, but I knew even then that I was too competitive to go through life with someone who did the same work as I. **********A look at any workplace shows that the economy might cease to function if everyone felt this way. **********''Where else do you meet people?'' asked Fran Rodgers, chief executive of WFD, a consulting company in Boston that specializes in personnel issues. (Not coincidentally, her husband is second-in-command at WFD.) People spend more of their time at work, she says, and women are doing jobs once done mostly by men. The result? Corporate courtship. **********One of Ms. Rodgers's clients found that 30 percent of employees who went through its training program married somebody else in the program. Add to that the spate of entrepreneurial start-ups begun by couples, and you have a good chunk of the population sharing work while sharing life -- navigating the territory that I ran away from all those years ago. **********Talk to them and they start with the advantages. ''We're both creating the marriage, and we're both creating the business,'' said Jeff Multz, who met his wife, Susan, when she was a client of his computer consulting company, Emerging Market Technologies, in Atlanta. She is now the company's president, and he, as vice president for sales and marketing, reports to her. **********That sense of partnership is a common refrain. ''We speak the same language,'' said Linda Safran, a medieval art historian who heads the department of Greek and Latin at the Catholic University of America in Washington. Her husband, Adam Cohen, is also a medieval art historian, and last year he took over her courses for three months when she was ordered to bed during a complicated pregnancy. **********Even so, these work-love mergers can take some negotiating. When Susan Multz joined her husband's company, she remembers that every week ''I was grabbing my keys and quitting.'' Why? Because, her husband answers drily, ''I was the president and she wasn't.'' Instead of calling a marriage counselor, they brought in a management consultant who suggested that Susan take on the day-to-day operations of the company -- and the title of president. **********The Cohen-Safran partnership is under a strain that would challenge even the savviest consultant. There are only half a dozen slots for medieval art professors in the Washington area, and all are filled, one by Professor Safran. As a result, Dr. Cohen can't find a job. Moving isn't an option; how many universities would have two openings for their esoteric specialty? So Dr. Cohen stays home, writes manuscripts, cares for 1-year-old Josiah and wonders if he should abandon his field. **********He says he does not resent his wife as she leaves each day to do the work he is also trained to do. **********''I'm angry all the time,'' he said, forcing a laugh, ''but never at Linda.'' **********I don't think I could be as selfless as all that. I'd be more like a dear friend of mine, a screenwriter out in California, whose husband just landed his dream job as a staff writer for a hit TV show. Unfortunately, it is also her dream job, and she is not taking it well. **********''Sure, I'm happy for him,'' she said morosely. ''But then I have to go back to my little office to write my pathetic little scripts.'' She finds herself reminding people, loudly and often, that at age 35 she is much, much younger than her 40-year-old husband. In other words, he had a head start. **********My own 40-year-old husband and I have a different sort of buffering distance between us. Bruce is a physician who also runs a genetic research lab, and he writes in a language I can only pretend to understand. Yes, sometimes I miss the easy shorthand of couples who do the same things, but I'm pleased to trade that for the complete absence of competition. I am freed to be the best writer in the house, just as he is the best doctor. **********That he will never scoop me on a story is hardly the reason that I married this remarkable man. But it sure is a relief to know that he won't."

Ayling seemed relaxed for a chief executive whose job is in peril, if you believe the reports in the British press and the whispering around water coolers in London's financial district. **********Mr. Ayling, chief executive of British Airways P.L.C., had even taken off his shoes during a recent interview, as though he were settling in for a long flight. **********He dismissed skeptics who have assailed British Airways' dismal financial performance and have questioned his unusual plan to reverse it by reducing the market share of his airline, Europe's largest. **********''That always cheers me up when people say, 'Nobody else is doing this,''' he said, ''because you can be absolutely sure that if you're just going along with the herd you're likely to be wrong.'' **********Mr. Ayling, 52, is not one to follow the herd. But today, as the company reported that its fiscal second-quarter earnings fell 86 percent, it is not clear that his approach is working. **********Mr. Ayling insists that the airline's finances will strengthen in the coming year. He recently introduced a new team of executives whose average age is 44 -- ''to give the place some energy,'' he said. He is also planning some major innovations next year, notably beds in business class for long-haul flights. **********''No manager loves to report bad trading figures,'' he said. ''But if we hadn't figured out why this was happening and we hadn't figured out what we should do about it, I would be very worried.'' **********Two years ago, Mr. Ayling said, ''we saw this coming.'' **********''Three years ago,'' he said, ''we knew there would be a profit freeze and we announced to the world we were going to take about 1 billion [pounds] worth of cost out of the business that then had a turnover of about 8 billion [pounds]. People said we were crazy. Nobody says that today.'' **********Indeed, analysts say that British Airways' chances for recovery are promising, but the airline's troubled past still unnerves some investors, an anxiety that may be justified. **********Since Mr. Ayling became British Airways' chief executive in the first month of 1996, the company has suffered a series of setbacks that have cast doubt on his ability to manage the former state-owned airline. **********A once-heralded alliance between British Air and American Airlines that he personally negotiated failed embarrassingly amid regulators' objections. **********A strike in 1997 by cabin crews cost the airline $200 million, and a plan to repaint the fleet's tail fins with international designs backfired after the British public protested, demanding the return of the Union Jack, and costing the company money as well as some of its self-proclaimed reputation as ''the world's favorite airline.'' **********The earnings figures released today, while largely expected, did little to ease investors' apprehension. Earnings for the quarter ending on Sept. 30 totaled $:30 million, or $48.6 million, down from $:216 million a year earlier. The airline, citing trans-Atlantic fare discounting, said six-month earnings fell 37.2 percent to $:218 million, and it is expecting to report an annual loss this fiscal year for the first time since the airline was privatized in 1987. **********British Airways shares, which have fallen 41 percent since April to six-year lows, ended in London today at $:3.3075, or $5.36, up less than a penny. **********Mr. Ayling is putting his own, somewhat diminished, reputation on the line as he tries to remake the airline. He is reducing its overall passenger capacity by 12 percent in an effort to weed out the low-cost fares, and cater more to first-  and business-class passengers who pay fares that are far higher and push profit margins up. **********''The economy segment of our business has become so uncompetitive that the airlines of the world today are competing for passengers at prices that barely, barely cover their on-the-day operating costs,'' Mr. Ayling said. ''It's economic madness.'' **********The industry has been plagued in recent years by a problem it euphemistically calls overcapacity -- too many seats for too few passengers. **********The Asian economic crisis that began in 1997 worsened the problem by reducing the number of fliers to and from that region. Many carriers responded by moving their largest aircraft from Asia routes to the North Atlantic, hoping to find customers where the economy was still healthy. **********But the addition to fleets of large new planes created even more capacity, driving down profit margins for coach-class passengers to single digits and in some cases, losses. British Airways has not been the only carrier affected; last week, KLM said its quarterly earnings decreased 57 percent in the recent quarter. **********''The average fare is in long-term real decline,'' said Chris Avery, an airline analyst at J. P. Morgan in London. ''It's a fundamentally declining-yield industry. You have a massive pressure between a declining unit revenue and rising unit cost. Airlines have perennial trouble sorting that conundrum out.'' **********The answer of Mr. Ayling and his new management team, to increase the number of business-class seats while decreasing its market share, is novel. ''British Airways has broken the traditional mold of the airline industry,'' said Chris Tarry, an analyst at Commerzbank in London. ''It is repositioning itself and will emerge structurally and significantly more profitable.'' **********Many analysts agree, and despite the company's poor performance, several have upgraded their ratings of the company. A report from J. P. Morgan suggests that British Airways is the first stock to buy for the cyclical upturn. **********While analysts applaud its focus on more profitable customers, questions remain whether there are enough business passengers willing to pay a premium and whether the airline's profit margins on business-class fares will be driven down by competition. **********Mr. Ayling acknowledges the potential problem. ''Even if there is pressure, and I accept that there may well be pressure, on the yields that come from the premium segment, they will always be better than the yields you get from transfer economy segments,'' he said, referring to coach passengers who transfer to connecting flights, generally the least profitable. **********He also predicted that once the airline introduces beds in business class -- ''the feel is like the inside of a really good executive car'' -- travelers will no longer be comparing airlines simply by the cost of the ticket. **********Some analysts agree. ''For those corporate fliers that have choice,'' Mr. Avery said, ''the prospect of a bed versus a reclining seat on a red-eye to Europe from the States becomes a little bit of a no-brainer. All things being equal, you will go for the bed and have a good night's sleep.'' **********As for Mr. Ayling's own forecast about his future on the job, he said  he's ''staying put, thank you very much.'' **********''I shall leave when I'm 60,'' he said, ''and not before.''"

As more and more people use E-mail to send photographs or word-processing documents as attachments to their messages, tech-support managers say, more and more people are faced with attachments that just won't open. **********Simply put, attachments are computer files that use E-mail messages for transport over the Net. Just as E-mail messages carry text from one computer to another, attachments carry files of many sorts, including word-processing documents, images and software programs. People usually use attachments when they are sending a file that contains something more than simple text, like a memo on special letterhead or a spreadsheet. **********In theory, attachments are supposed to make life easier. They can enable scientific collaborators to send one another graphs showing research results. They allow friends and relatives to send photographs over the Internet. With just a few clicks of the mouse, they can eliminate the cumbersome job of sending floppy disks through regular mail or the intimidating prospect of sending something via F.T.P., a file-transfer protocol favored by more sophisticated Internet users. **********That's the theory. The reality is often much different. **********''There are so many things that can go wrong,'' said Greg Smith, a computer-support consultant at Stanford University. ''It's not as easy as it is supposed to be.'' **********Even experienced computer users become frustrated. John Mainwaring, a longtime technology professional at Nortel Networks, said that when he and his colleagues first tried to share information via attachments, ''it was a very hit-or-miss affair.'' **********Michael J. Day, an English professor at Northern Illinois University at Northern Illinois University, has been using E-mail in his classes for years, but said in an E-mail interview, ''There are still attachments that defy my efforts, such as Word Perfect files converted to MS Word that arrived the other day and completely crashed the two computers on which I tried to open them.'' **********Attachments usually show up in E-mail messages as icons. E-mail programs like Eudora, or those that come with Microsoft Office, America Online or Lotus Notes, are designed to enable people to simply click on those icons, triggering the file to open in a separate window. Click on a file that was created using a word processor like Microsoft Word, and if you have Word on your computer, the file should open immediately. **********But in many cases, that click opens nothing but the door to confusion. Sometimes the file does not open at all. Sometimes a dialog box opens on the computer screen, asking the user which program should be used to open the file. Once in a while, a message appears asking for the file to be decompressed, or unzipped. And then there is the gobbledygook response -- the file actually opens, but displays a useless jumble of keyboard symbols, looking something like a series of profanities written comic-book style. **********Frustrated users should at least take comfort in one fact: Recipients are almost never to blame for attachment problems. **********''Usually it is the sender's fault, whether the problem is intentional or unintentional,'' said Kenneth Breshears, manager of technical support for Eudora. **********Typically, E-mail experts say, the problems can be traced to three technological glitches: The file may be incompatible with the software on your computer, the file may not have been encoded or decoded properly as it journeyed across the Internet, or the file has been compressed and requires decompressing before it can be read. **********In most cases of attachment aggravation, incompatibility is the culprit. Consider the exchange of files via floppy disks. If you were to give someone a disk containing a document created in Microsoft Word, but that person used Word Perfect, the file would probably show up as a page with gibberish or not open at all. The same goes for attachments. **********''The real challenge here is that we have an unlimited amount of software developers that have an unlimited amount of file formats,'' said Jeffrey Belk, Eudora's president and general manager. His suggestion: senders should check whether the recipient's computer has software that will open the file. **********To avoid incompatibility problems altogether, some technology experts recommend purchasing software that lets you view attached files of myriad types without having to open them. **********Ben Z. Gottesman, technical director of software for PC Magazine, suggests trying Keyview, created by Verity (www.keyview .com), or Quick View Plus, by Jasc Software (www.jasc.com). Each program, which displays the file but does not allow you to edit or otherwise alter it, sells for $59. ''These programs are quicker to use than launching a big application,'' Mr. Gottesman said, ''and they can avoid the spread of worms, like Melissa,'' which cannot be activated when a file is merely viewed without actually being opened. **********Encoding can also wreak havoc, though most E-mail programs are now sophisticated enough to eliminate the need for users to even know what encoding means. To encode a file is to repackage it as a text file so that it can travel across the Net as quickly and easily as a regular E-mail message. Most attachments are wrapped up using one of three encoding standards -- MIME, BinHex or Uuencode -- which are recognized by most E-mail programs. **********Most programs automatically decode encoded files before they arrive in E-mail In boxes. But some users may come across an attachment that they must decode themselves. If a user of America Online's E-mail program receives one message with three attached photographs from someone using a different E-mail program, for example,  those files will be in the form of a MIME package that must be decoded. To do that, users need to have decoding software. AOL's E-mail help pages tell users to download Winzip (www.winzip.com). **********In rarer cases, files will arrive that were not packaged correctly by the sender's E-mail program. Gibberish or a message about corrupted files results. ''That's where people bail, and say, 'Just fax it to me,' '' said Mr. Smith, who regularly conducts a clinic on E-mail attachments at Stanford. **********An attachment may need to be decompressed as well as decoded. Compression is a method of squeezing computer files into tiny packages so that they can move over the Net and be downloaded as quickly as possible. Some E-mail programs will decompress files automatically. Others will show you an icon with the extension .zip (common on Windows-based files) or .sit (common on Macintosh files). **********As with decoding, decompressing files requires special software. Several decompression programs have decoding mechanisms. Tech-support experts suggest using PKZip (www.pkware.com) or Winzip for Windows users and Stuffit Expander (www.aladdinsys.com/expander) for Macintosh users. Typically these measures are taken by experienced computer users. **********''People who are clever enough to use compression are usually clever enough not to send it to someone who doesn't know how to deal with it,'' Mr. Smith said. **********But even computer gurus will admit that sometimes E-mail attachments can create more work than they are worth. Dr. Day at Northern Illinois University tells his students and colleagues to send attachments only if absolutely necessary. **********''Let's remember that the Internet lines are getting crowded,'' Dr. Day said. ''Plain text E-mail messages take up a lot less space and bandwidth than E-mail messages with fancy attachments.'' **********Attachment Etiquette **********Dos and Don'ts **********Here are a few tips for avoiding attachment aggravation: **********KNOW YOUR SENDER -- Do not open an attachment if you don't recognize the sender. Some of the most dangerous computer viruses have been spread by E-mail attachments, which are activated only upon opening. **********BE DISCREET -- Do not send an attachment to a large number of people simultaneously. A one-megabyte file sent to a 500-person mailing list creates 500 copies of that.That many megabytes moving through the E-mail system at one time, which could clog or even cripple the mail server. **********TALK IT OVER -- Let recipients know that an attachment is coming. You may even want to determine whether a package of compressed photographs, for example, can easily be decompressed or whether the pictures should be sent individually. **********LEND A HAND -- Let recipients know what they need to do to open the attachment. They may need to know what word-processing program, for example, was used. **********WARN OF WHOPPERS -- Indicate the file's size. People with slow Internet connections can then decide whether to download the file later, instead of clicking on the file and discovering that they have started a 15-minute download. And some E-mail programs are designed to filter out files over a certain size. **********AVOID EMBARRASSMENT -- If you get an attachment with an .exe extension, be prepared -- especially if you are at the office. The file might be an animated program or video, complete with sound. You may want to turn down your speaker volume or wait until the office is empty."

Analysts had expected the company to earn 29 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings.

Cohen, rarely speaks directly to the commander running the war in the Balkans. Aides to the commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, derisively call him ''Senator Cohen'' since he spends more time advising and cajoling his former colleagues in the Senate. **********The soldier at the top, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is the general who speaks when spoken to. He is said to be unwilling -- or unable -- to air the Pentagon's misgivings about the war, though during a recent White House meeting he bluntly ended a discussion about sending ground troops into a ''semi-permissive'' situation in Kosovo, without a peace agreement. **********''It's like being a little bit pregnant, sir,'' General Shelton told President Clinton, according to an official familiar with the discussion. **********Together, Mr. Cohen and General Shelton are President Clinton's top military advisers as the NATO campaign in the the Balkans grows into its third month, but in a sense they are not its leaders. **********Unlike their predecessors from the Persian Gulf war, Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, who drew up war plans and gave Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander in the field, more firepower than he wanted, Mr. Cohen and General Shelton have an entirely different relationship with their field commander. **********Even though the two, as President Clinton's war chiefs, have authority over how American forces are used, the war is not being run from the Pentagon's war rooms. Nor is it run day to day from the White House. Although President Clinton also reviews the most sensitive targets and weighs in on significant decisions, his direct participation in the military planning is said to be episodic. **********Instead, General Clark, an American who is the allied commander in Europe, is charged with running the war from Belgium. But he must answer not only to his own political leaders but also to the leaders of an often unwieldy NATO alliance of 18 other nations that acts only by consensus. **********That has turned Mr. Cohen and General Shelton more into managers than commanders, trying to balance various domestic and international demands while maintaining support for the effort. Reflecting the Pentagon's wariness over the war, Mr. Cohen and General Shelton are resisting any escalation of the conflict that would draw the military into the ground campaign. **********How they have played their parts has shaped some of the day-to-day conduct of the war. The nature of the campaign has shaped their roles as well. **********Inevitably, perhaps, tensions have emerged. General Clark's aides say that the Pentagon's caution and  checks and balances clash with his war-fighter's urgency to press the fight. **********Cohen Says His Role Is to Rally Support **********Mr. Cohen says his role is to rally support not only within NATO but also within the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, where he was a Republican lawmaker for 24 years. ''I would never purport to be a military strategist, where I was going to start drawing military plans,'' Mr. Cohen said in an interview in his office. **********Mr. Cohen and General Shelton have supported most of General Clark's requests, aides say, whether for weapons or for more ambitious tactics. But they have also acted as a brake on General Clark's most aggressive proposals -- from his eagerness to use Apache helicopters to his desire to base rockets in Croatia to fire into Kosovo. They have also served as a brake on recommendations by General Clark and some allies, like Britain, to plan at least for a possible ground invasion to repulse Yugoslavia's forces from Kosovo. **********Every day, they review General Clark's bombing targets and, despite the expanding bombardment, still reject some as too risky. ''You always want to make sure that you have civilian oversight of an operation like this,'' Mr. Cohen said. **********For Mr. Cohen, who has served as Secretary since January 1997, and General Shelton, who took over as Chairman nine months later, NATO's air war will be a lasting mark on their terms, which have already seen the running military confrontations with Iraq and cruise missile strikes against the Sudan and Afghanistan last August. **********Mr. Cohen said the air war would have been fought differently ''if this were simply a U.S. operation.'' **********''It would have been wider and more intense from my perspective,'' he told some reporters on Friday. **********Mr. Cohen has always seen himself as a consensus builder -- from his days as Mayor of Bangor, Me., to his tenure as the only Republican in Mr. Clinton's Cabinet. At 58, he is erudite, dapper and detached, leading a department inclined to brawn and backslapping. He did not serve in the military -- in the years leading up to the Vietnam War -- because of student and marriage deferments. **********In Congress, though, he developed an expertise in military issues, driven in part by the importance of defense contracts to Maine. He also dabbled with literary aspirations, publishing several books, including two volumes of poetry. **********In 1986, he published a poem about flying in the back seat of an F-15. **********We were quicksilver **********sliding on the blue **********water of thought, **********unmindful, almost, that **********on the gleaming wings **********of the death machine **********hung the terrible paradox **********of peace. **********His experience in Congress has helped the Administration fend off  Republican attacks on the war and on other issues, Administration officials and lawmakers say. Mr. Cohen briefs his former colleagues in Congress on the war's progress in formal appearances and private exchanges. **********On Tuesday, Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, called for the bombing to stop. The next morning Mr. Cohen invited Mr. Bennett and half a dozen other Senators to his office in the Pentagon for breakfast with him and General Shelton. **********Afterward, Senator Bennett sounded tempered, if not completely won over. ''I was more tempted to believe the optimistic reports,'' on the war's progress ''when it was Cohen and Shelton describing them to us, with no keepers from the White House to monitor what they were saying,'' he said. **********Another Republican Senator, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said Mr. Cohen ''knows all the back alleys over here.'' **********But he said he was far from convinced that Mr. Cohen and General Shelton were overseeing a sound strategy. **********''I think Cohen has bought this President some additional time, just because of who he is,'' Senator Hagel said, ''but I think that time is running out.'' **********Despite a Setback, A Rise in Financing **********Mr. Cohen's has hit roadblocks in Congress. The House, in a split vote last month, refused to support the Administration's war effort. Mr. Cohen contended that it was more important that the House has since supported an increase in military financing intended partly to pay for the Balkan operations. **********Compared with Mr. Cohen, General Shelton appears far less comfortable with his public role of explaining the war effort. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he serves as the senior uniformed adviser to the President and Secretary of Defense. But compared with his predecessors, he has had a low profile. **********''He's not uncomfortable being silent,'' one aide said. **********He is widely respected as a soldier, a former commando and paratrooper who led two of the Army's most coveted combat commands: the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., and the entire 18th Airborne Corps. In the Persian Gulf war he led a helicopter assault deep into Iraq. As commander of the 18th, he oversaw the American intervention in Haiti. **********General Shelton declined to be interviewed. Officials have described him as ambivalent about the use of military force in the Balkans, misgivings shared by many uniformed officers. **********However, he does not consider it his role to argue, but rather to provide clear military advice, the officials said. **********In briefings on Capitol Hill, General Shelton sticks to the operational details, which has led to frustration and criticism. **********''A lot of us here would just like to hear him talk for five minutes about what the concept is,'' said Senator Hagel. **********As Chairman, General Shelton has acted as one military conduit between Washington and the field. **********While General Clark is the Supreme Allied Commander, he also serves as commander of American forces in the region. **********In theory, as one of the nation's nine operational commanders, he reports directly to Mr. Cohen, but in practice he has dealt day to day with General Shelton, particularly on operational updates. Mr. Cohen said he prefers it that way. **********Twice a week, Mr. Cohen receives a briefing from General Clark through a video camera in a highly secured conference room. **********Several weeks into the campaign, he began inviting the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, even though they have no direct war-fighting role. It is another of his efforts to forge consensus, this time within the Pentagon. **********General Clark, 54, is a former Rhodes scholar who, as he rose through the ranks, became savvy in the ways of Washington. He served as Richard C. Holbrooke's top military aide in the 1995 Dayton negotiations over Bosnia, and as an officer on the Joint Staff he developed a close relationship with Samuel R. Berger, then the President's deputy national security adviser. **********White House aides say that General Clark and Mr. Berger, now the senior adviser, talk regularly, but that this is not a back channel, as some at the Pentagon suspect. When Mr. Clinton met with his senior advisers at the White House last week on the same day General Clark was in town for consultations, General Clark did not attend, but General Shelton did, honoring Mr. Cohen's preferences. **********Differences on Strategy A Source of Tension **********The tensions that have emerged between the Pentagon and General Clark's staff often reflect institutional differences over approach and strategy. **********On matters of strategy, General Clark feels the Pentagon has not been as responsive as it could be, second-guessing his requests. **********Top aides to General Shelton say that NATO's planning staff in Mons, Belgium, is inexperienced at war-planning. ''The Saceur's staff is not a war-fighting staff,'' a Shelton aide said, using the military acronym for the staff of the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. ''It's never fought or planned a war.'' **********General Shelton must also balance General Clark's requests for forces with the demands from other American field commanders around the world. **********In other respects, though, Mr. Cohen has strongly supported General Clark, cajoling his counterparts in the NATO allies to approve more bombing targets and resisting calls  for pauses in the air strikes. **********For Mr. Cohen, this is a turnaround brought on by the expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. As a Senator, he opposed sending American troops to Bosnia, but as Secretary of Defense he was ''an early and strong advocate'' for bombing Yugoslavia, according to Mr. Berger."

He is a 39-year-old transport tycoon and former race car driver from Zimbabwe, Billy Rautenbach. Congo's President calls him ''Mr. Billy.'' **********In downtown Kisangani, to the nation's east, Ugandan soldiers patrol streets almost empty of cars. The cars, locals say, were stolen long ago by Rwandan soldiers, who are disliked here. These days, the Rwandans stay mostly out of sight in camps south of the muddy Congo River. **********Historically, in the minds of outsiders hungry for its riches -- gold for traders and souls for missionaries -- Congo has rarely belonged to itself alone. Now this huge, unsteady state has become a battlefield for soldiers from no fewer than six foreign nations who are fighting a war that has as much to do with problems outside of Congo as inside it. **********A fundamental reworking of the old rules of Africa may be unfolding in the five-month-old Congo war. By agreement, African nations are not supposed to invade one another. But critics of Uganda and Rwanda, Congo's neighbors to the east, say those two countries did exactly that by sending in troops in August to help the rebels seeking to overthrow President Laurent Kabila. **********The borders of African nations, set up arbitrarily by the Europeans who colonized the continent  a century ago, are supposed to be inviolable. Yet Congo is now split in two, perhaps for good: President Kabila and his allies, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad, control its western two-thirds. The rebels and their allies, Uganda and Rwanda, control a growing third in the east. **********With so many combatants, a major question is where the conflict is leading not only Congo but also Africa itself. Diplomats around the world worry that a full-blown regional war may not be far off, for no African war has ever drawn in so many outside nations. In the longer run, many experts say that the Congo war may become a point of departure from which African nations begin to re-imagine themselves in ways not possible under the old rules. Wars between nations, largely absent since Africans became independent starting in the 1960's, may become more common. As troubling, many experts say, the national boundary lines that have defined African countries for a century, and lent some stability, may slowly come apart. **********It is a danger that worries many Congolese. ''If we make the mistake of partitioning the Congo, all of Africa will follow because all our borders are artificial creations,'' said Dr. Kabamba Mbwebwe, the chief of the emergency room at Kinshasa General Hospital, who is involved in opposition politics. ''It's a really dangerous precedent.'' **********Outsiders are concerned too. A senior European diplomat in Kinshasa calls the Congo war ''the first big test of borders.'' **********''This is what we left behind, the British, the French, the Germans, the Belgians,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Nobody is happy with the borders they have but nobody wants to open the Pandora's box.'' **********Congolese Anger Over Loss of Control **********Congo is particularly divisible, experts say, because those foreign troops tread on land rich in gold, diamonds, copper, cobalt, oil and timber. Each outside nation has interests in Congo -- security, financial or both. So some Africa watchers say that a second and more subdued scramble for Congo, this time involving not European colonists but its own neighbors, is also helping pull the nation apart. **********The irony is not lost here. ''Because of our weakness,'' said Omari Leasisi, a former Governor of eastern Kivu province who Mr. Kabila freed from prison, ''We have become a neo-colony of other countries.'' **********It is easy to see why Congolese feel that their destiny has slipped from their fingers -- 20 months after Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator since 1965, was overthrown and the nation of Zaire became, once again and with great hope, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. **********News of major developments in the war come as often from Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, as from Kinshasa, the capital of Congo. A few weeks ago, the head of the badly divided rebels, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, had to fly to Uganda to learn from officials there the details of a peace meeting in Paris. **********It is a loss of control that angers people in Congo. The country's major cities crawl with foreign troops, often staying free in the best hotels. At the Inter-Continental Hotel in Kinshasa, Zimbabwean soldiers get on the elevators on one floor, Namibians on another, and Angolans on yet another, all wearing different uniforms, but heavily armed with guns and explosives. In Kisangani in the rebel-held area and Lubumbashi in the Government zone, there are reports of food shortages. **********People around the nation are adamant that Congo must remain intact. ''Being Congolese is like being in your bath,'' said Louis Kembo, a businessman in Kisangani. ''It's your place. It's yours. It can never be divided.'' **********Congo is Africa's second-largest country after Sudan, a third as big as the United States. By sheer size, location and potential for wealth, it is one of Africa's most important countries. But it barely ever existed as a state, either under Belgium's loose colonialism or under Mobutu's years of corruption and neglect. **********More than 200 ethnic groups live in Congo. Roads are impassable. Kinshasa, in the west, is a capital in name only, its monuments crumbling and its hold over the east theoretical even before the war. These days, the Government grasps for ways, from songs to clothing, to unify the country and its people. It has produced a video featuring many of Kinshasa's most famous singers just to get people to use the new Congolese franc. **********But few people have televisions. Along the eastern border, 1,000 miles away, people have bank accounts and use telephones next door in Rwanda. In the southeast, they gravitate philosophically to South Africa and, for services like mail, across the border to Zambia. **********''The Congo should never have been one state,'' said Basil Davidson, an eminent Africa scholar. ''It simply suited Belgian convenience.'' **********Congo's beginnings were fractured, and experts say a straight line runs from its birth to its problems today. In 1884, the explorer Henry Morton Stanley arrived in Belgium with the raw materials for incoherence: 450 treaties from men claiming to be chiefs and willing to cede sovereignty. **********Later that year, Congo was a central question of a conference in Berlin, which ended in 1885 with the first draft of how Europe would carve up Africa. The borders established had little to do with geography or the lines that separated ethnic groups. **********Enshrining Identity Established in Berlin **********Yet in 1963, the newly free nations gathered to form the Organization of African Unity and enshrined the Berlin borders in its charter. A second understanding was equally important: No African nation had the right to invade another African nation. In the 35 years since, there have been few exceptions to either rule. Now the conflict in Congo threatens both. **********In 1995, Rwanda and Uganda, concerned about rebels attacking their own borders from inside Congo, sponsored a group of anti-Mobutu rebels headed by a slightly disreputable longtime exile, Laurent Desire Kabila. Mobutu, near death, was toppled in May 1997. **********But relations between Mr. Kabila and his sponsors, Uganda and Rwanda, quickly soured (as they did with the United States, itself a cold war patron of Mobutu) as Mr. Kabila turned autocratic. Last summer, he purged his leadership of advisers from the Tutsi ethnic group who helped him to power. He also failed to control the fighters who continued attacks on Rwanda and Uganda. **********So in August, those two nations sent troops to back a second rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, again dominated by Tutsi, but this time to unseat Mr. Kabila. **********In turn, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad all sent in troops to back him, angrily citing the non-invasion principle. The stage was set for a war unlike any other in Africa. **********Only last week Salim Ahmed Salim, the Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity, reaffirmed the group's strong opposition to outside intervention, condemning Uganda and Rwanda by drawing a comparison with another Congo neighbor that has steered clear of the conflict. **********''Even Tanzania has its interests in D.R.C. as a neighbor, since the war in Congo means a continued influx of refugees, but did not send troops,'' Mr. Salim said. **********Michael G. Shatzberg, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who wrote three books on Zaire, said: ''Those old rules had their drawbacks but they were effective in keeping the genie of interstate conflict in the bottle. All bets are off at the moment.'' **********Many experts argue that the war is essentially a stalemate, with each side unable to dislodge the other. Some fear that Congo's neighbors simply want to carve up the nation and annex territory outright. Rwanda, for example, could then have an enclave of land populated by Tutsi as a way to prevent another genocide, like the one in 1994. Other experts say Rwanda and Uganda could establish a protectorate. **********Others see an economic motivation -- the ability to plunder Congo's rich natural resources. Many nations who are taking sides in this war have financial stakes, according to Johan Peleman, director of the International Peace Information Service in Belgium, which studies financial incentives behind conflicts. **********Mr. Pelemen said Ugandans -- notably President Yoweri K. Museveni's brother -- have gold-mining and other business interests in the east. Angola has signed a joint venture with Congo's state oil company. The rebels say Zimbabwe's President, Robert Mugabe, has mining investments in the south and that the appointment of Mr. Rautenbach, the Zimbabwean tycoon, to head the state-owned mining company, Gecamines, is payback for Zimbabwe. Mr. Rautenbach denies any political connections. **********Private mining companies, Mr. Peleman speculated, could also sign contracts giving any of the players an incentive to keep the territory they hold -- or at least to let the war drag on. **********''For economic players, border sovereignty and all that stuff is not so important,'' he said. **********A Nation Based On What It Is Not **********For all Mobutu's failings, Congolese and outside experts say, he gave life to a national identity even as the state itself expired. Since the rebellion, many Congolese express that identity sharply in terms of who they are not -- that is, any of the six outside nations. **********This sense of both nationalism and hostility seems strong, on either side of Congo's cleft. In Kisangani, Ebony Badengo, 50, a bank manager with a soft voice, exploded when asked whether his nation could be cut up. ''This big country is good for us,'' he said. ''The idea of partition is coming from other countries who want to get it. We would never accept that.'' **********But it has almost never been up to the Congolese to accept or refuse decisions about the shape of their country. As more countries join this war -- the Central African Republic opened its territory to Mr. Kabila's forces two weeks ago -- the assertions in Kinshasa that it is not worried about a break-up sound less convincing. **********Already, the Government has erected new billboards in the capital, next to old ones showing the bald head of Mr. Kabila with the message: ''With this man, hope is reborn!'' **********The new roadside propaganda is less boastful, but more pleading, clearer in its call for unity. One billboard urges people to unite and support Mr. Kabila. And next to it, an ambitious call for something that eluded the Belgians and Mobutu, and seems ever more elusive now: ''Only one goal: Integral development.''"

Still, no one is completely dismissing the idea that dollars could become the currency of Argentina, and the Fed could even become the lender of last resort. **********Mr. Menem also went a step further by suggesting that neighboring Brazil resolve its economic crisis by pegging the value of its currency 1 to 1 to the dollar, just as Argentina did in 1991. That, too, would be a move toward replacing Brazilian real with the dollar. **********Argentine officials say after Argentina and Brazil had converted their currencies to the dollar, they could move the entire Western Hemisphere decisively toward a regional currency like Europe's new euro. More than likely, the officials said, Mexico would also follow Argentina's lead, and the hemispheric currency would inevitably become the greenback. **********''It's a shocking novelty for a country like Argentina to make this kind of a proposal,'' said Carlos Fedrigotti, president of Citibank in Argentina. ''President Menem has started the debate, and it has to do with the future of not only Argentina, but of the entire continent, which will have to eventually fall under the influence of the dollar in trade, capital flows and, ultimately, in geopolitics.'' **********The dollar is already omnipresent here. Most cabdrivers and restaurants accept dollars. Automated teller machines offer dollars and pesos. Virtually all mortgages and apartment rental contracts are drawn in dollars. Even cellular telephone bills are stated in dollars, and customers are free to pay in American or Argentine currency. **********As of Feb. 15, $36.9 billion in Argentine certificates of deposit were denominated in dollars, compared with $13.6 billion in pesos. Nevertheless, Mr. Menem's proposal to replace the peso totally with the dollar has been greeted by sneers by much of the opposition and the news media. Brazil has said it has no interest in the idea, although that could change if its currency continues to slide. **********The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has expressed skepticism. Enthusiasts for the private sector here and Government economists say the idea is probably years from fruition, even as they argue that using the dollar would lower interest rates and increase foreign trade and investment. **********With 10 months left in his term, Mr. Menem has made what he calls ''dollarization'' his top economic and diplomatic priority. Senior officials have begun informal talks with officials at the United States Treasury Department and Federal Reserve, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has encouraged the Argentines to make a formal treaty proposal. **********''Dollarization could be just a good idea that disappears in a few months because of politics,'' Finance Undersecretary Miguel A. Kiguel said in an interview. ''Or it could be a good idea that will generate its own positive momentum. My guess is Argentina could be a very important pilot case that would open the door to other countries, mostly in Latin America, to adopt the dollar.'' **********Today only Panama and Liberia, two tiny countries with long historical attachments to the United States, use the American currency as their own. Panama ran short of greenbacks several years ago but it has generally had enough of them to go around. **********In no country in Latin America is the dollar exchanged anywhere nearly as freely as it is here. **********Argentine economists note that in technical terms converting to a dollar economy would be no large feat. Under the convertibility scheme of 1991, all peso notes issued by the Central Bank are backed by dollar or gold reserves. In the last year, all Government bonds, even those sold in local markets, have been denominated in dollars. **********Mr. Menem has asked his senior economic advisers to draw up plans to pay Government employees in dollars and collect taxes in dollars, moves that would speed a transformation. **********Argentines became attached to the dollar in the 1980's, when inflation galloped so fast that people converted their paychecks to dollars as fast as they could. Of the $5 billion in Argentine bank accounts in April 1991, when the peg was installed, nearly 40 percent were in dollars. The peg virtually ended capital flight, and bank accounts have grown to $78 billion, 57 percent of which are now in dollar accounts. **********''Our people already can freely choose whether they deal in pesos or dollars,'' noted Senator Domingo Cavallo, a former Economy Minister. **********But by raising the issue of a replacement of the peso with the dollar almost immediately after Brazil devalued the real six weeks ago, officials said Mr. Menem was sending a powerful signal to the international investors that Argentina had no intention of following that example. They said Mr. Menem would convert to a dollar economy by emergency decree if the peso suffers a severe speculative attack. **********Mr. Menem's move succeeded in reducing the difference in interest rates between Argentine bonds and the lower rates on United States Treasury bills over the last month. In another sign of confidence, Argentine commercial bank accounts have accumulated funds since Mr. Menem first spoke of ''dollarization.'' **********Argentine officials said they wanted to negotiate a treaty with the United States that would make the Federal Reserve the lender of last resort in case an Argentine bank should fail. They also want the United States Government to compensate the $750 million loss that Argentina would sustain in yearly interest earned from the United States Treasury bills that the Central Bank holds. That interest would be automatically lost when the Central Bank sold its dollar reserves to the public to take pesos out of circulation. **********To entice Clinton Administration officials -- and eventually United States Senators, whose approval would be needed for any treaty -- Mr. Menem's advisers are drawing up a series of proposals. One would give the Fed a strong supervisory role over Argentine financial institutions."

The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index made a similar gain, rising 21.40 points, or 1.69 percent, to close at 1,289.99. **********Procter & Gamble, up 5 1/8, to 100 1/2,  and American Express, up 5 3/8, to 122 1/2, accounted for more than a quarter of the Dow's gain. **********Procter & Gamble, which touched a record 100 15/16, was lifted by comments of Carol Wilke, who covers the company for Prudential Securities and met with its senior management Wednesday. She predicted that a global revamping, with details yet to be spelled out, would accelerate earnings growth, and she raised her price target for the stock to 115 from 100 over the next 12 months. **********Small-company stocks, as gauged by the Russell 2000 index, did even better, with a surge of 2.23 percent, with investors seeming to seek value in this lagging sector.

The main Tokyo index climbed 3.03 percent, and European markets were ahead by more than 1 percent. The Bovespa in Brazil, benefiting from an interest-rate cut, jumped 4.88 percent, to an eight-month high. **********The rally in stocks also bucked a rise in interest rates traced by some analysts to an unexpected drop in the number of people making first-time claims for jobless benefits last week and a very small decline from January's record pace of home sales.

They protested on radio and in front of Government offices. They appealed to business and political leaders. They even started a petition drive to ask President Clinton for damages. **********''The Americans are not showing any real concern for our economic and social development,'' said Junior Cottle, chairman of a group of marijuana growers who described himself as ''representative of the ganja man.'' **********Mr. Cottle said he did not grow marijuana but did smoke it. **********Marijuana is not legal here. But its production in the remote mountains has, American officials said, taken off in recent years, making St. Vincent the second largest grower in the Caribbean, after Jamaica. **********Growers said they were turning to the crop to deal with an unemployment rate that is officially 20 percent but that many people here say is far higher. **********The animosity directed at the United States comes from two directions.  Residents have a feeling that Washington has abandoned this corner of the world, now that the cold war is over and it no longer sees a Communist threat in the Caribbean. **********There is also a marked hostility against Mr. Clinton for waging war with Europe over banana trade preferences, the legitimate backbone of the economy. **********The nub of the dispute is that Europe unfairly favors bananas grown by its former colonies, including this  onetime British outpost, where English is spoken and cricket is a favorite sport. The preference discriminates against American companies  that produce bananas, the United States says. **********Officials here say removing the import protections would deal an economic catastrophe to countries that have little capacity to grow anything else and whose bananas are costly to grow. Some Government and business leaders say the United States risks undermining its anti-drug efforts in the region if banana growers turn to drugs -- not just marijuana, but also trafficking in Colombian heroin and cocaine as alternatives. **********At the very least, some Caribbean experts note, the banana issue is creating such deep resentment that it may compromise the willingness of Caribbean countries to continue cooperating in anti-drug efforts. **********''When Caricom countries meet in July, I think you'll see a bold statement of resistance,'' said Ivelaw Griffith, a Caribbean expert at Florida International University in Miami. Caricom is the Caribbean Community, the regional economic association. **********Marijuana growers here are seeking to anger the public against further eradication while exploring an agenda that includes promoting marijuana for medicinal purposes and pushing for job creation in fishing and nonbanana agriculture. **********The president of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Martin Barnard, said of the United States' stance: ''People don't understand it. They're saying, 'What more can they do to us?' '' **********Prime Minister James F. Mitchell, who asked for the mission in December, refused to see the farmers, telling them in a terse letter in November that his Government was ''firmly opposed to the illegal drug trade.'' **********Mr. Mitchell said in an interview that he would like to see even more American assistance to curb marijuana cultivation and the heroin and cocaine trafficking through the Caribbean. But he said he regarded the friend in drug control as a foe on the banana front. **********''We have a property-owner democracy, and that's what's been threatened, our quality of life,'' he said. **********American trade officials said that they did not want to hurt Caribbean banana producers and that there were ways to protect them like subsidies to bring down banana prices. **********At the University of Miami in February, the Clinton Administration director of drug policy, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, declined to comment on the banana problem, calling it ''a complex issue.'' But General McCaffrey said he did not accept the argument that ''it's either this or drugs.'' **********''Nobody turns to marijuana or opium or cocaine production as a survival mechanism,'' he said. ''They turn to that because you can make more money.'' **********But drug riches are not readily apparent at the house of a 39-year-old banana farmer who also grows marijuana and identified himself only as Nebo. He lives in the northeastern town of Georgetown, an hour's drive from here, in an unpainted concrete-block shell with two bedrooms and a family of seven. **********As the sweet smell of marijuana wafted in from somewhere around the house, Nebo said his 10,000 marijuana plants yielded an income that was at least 10 times the revenue from his three acres of bananas. Nebo said he had no reason to grow bananas anymore except that ''it's in the culture.'' **********''It's been in my family,'' he said. ''I just keep doing it. 'Right now I'm taking my income from ganja to support the banana crop. Ganja has been beneficial to me. It's paid for my house, schooling, food, the bills.'' **********Another banana grower in Georgetown, Iris Walker, said she and her husband would never resort to drugs. But she said marijuana farmers should be accepted as a necessary evil, underscoring the feelings of many residents. **********''It's illegal,'' Ms. Walker said. ''But if some people don't do it, they don't have bread for the children.'' **********She called the Americans ''selfish.'' **********Government officials said they were trying hard to diversify the economy to reduce the reliance on the banana crop, which is recovering from a slump caused by bad weather and low prices. **********Tourism in St. Vincent and the Grenadines earns three times as much as bananas. But officials say that the agricultural dollar goes longer because it is spent locally and that no industry can yet replace bananas in importance. **********Marijuana growers and their supporters say they stand ready to help. **********''We're ready to be part of the process,'' Mr. Cottle said. ''The fact that we come out and talk illustrates the magnitude of the problem.''"

The main strategy โ there are numerous variants โ is to buy equal dollar amounts of the 10 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average with the highest dividend yields and hold them for a year. **********The idea is that the shares are offering better dividend payouts than the other blue-chip stocks in the index because they have run into some kind of trouble or disfavor with investors but that a company does not make it into the Dow if it cannot deal with a bit of adversity. While they work out their problems, the Dow dogs reward their owners with higher yields than the rest of the stocks in the average. **********The theory became well known in the early 1990s, and back testing showed it would have produced far better returns than buying the stocks in the index over the previous two decades. The concept can be used with any index of dividend-paying stocks, and it has been exported to other countries. **********In January 1998, The Money Report identified the 10 highest-yielding stocks in Britain, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States. Investors would have done better to let sleeping dogs lie; except for Tokyo, the averages had better total returns than the combination of capital gains and dividends from investing equal amounts of money in the Dogs. The year before, the Tokyo Dogs did much worse than the overall Nikkei index, while the hounds of Paris and Frankfurt handily outperformed their markets. The canines in the other markets trailed their averages. **********The lagging performance of the Dow dogs has given pause to Michael O'Higgins, the original proponent of the theory, and he has added a bond component to the strategy, which can be executed by individual investors or purchased through a fund he runs. The new twist is that in years when bond yields are high relative to stock valuations, investors take their money out of the stock market entirely. **********Since the inception of his new O'Higgins Fund in January 1998, Mr. O'Higgins has been investing in bonds rather than stocks. The fund is up more than 10 percent from inception through March 16, although the Dow's return has been nearly three times that. So far, the fund is small, with $3.5 million invested, but Mr. O'Higgins's new book ""Beating the Dow With Bonds,"" outlines his new 17-step theory and the book may attract new investors. **********Not everybody thinks the old Dogs theory has fleas. Merrill Lynch Defined Asset Funds, which sells the lion's share of investment products based on the Dogs strategy as part of a brokerage consortium, said it was committed to the original theory, although it has withdrawn products based on Asian indexes because of weak demand. Its Defined Asset Funds are unit investment trusts, portfolios of stocks that are created once a year to invest in the Dogs. **********Unlike mutual funds, unit investment trusts are not meant to trade their portfolios. **********Payden & Rygel Investment Group, which runs mutual funds based on the theory, said it would let the Dogs run. Chris Orndorff said the firm's $40 million Euro Growth & Income fund โ originally comprising 40 high-yield stocks from France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain โ was up 15.64 percent in 1998, a good return but one that trails the roughly 25 percent gain an investor would have achieved by investing equal amounts in the four main market indexes. **********Still, the Dogs theory limited volatility, he said. ""During the market panic last summer, our fund fell much less than other European funds,"" Mr. Orndorff added. **********Taking advantage of a unified Europe, the fund has added stocks from Finland, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. For the year through mid-March, it was down 1.1 percent, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index was up about 1.8 percent. **********Payden & Rygel's $275 million U.S. Dogs fund, meanwhile, was up 18.10 percent for the year, nearly matching the total return on the Dow. **********""As the Dogs of the Dow is a value strategy, which in general underperformed last year, we were quite pleased with the return versus the Dow index itself,"" Mr. Orndorff said. ""The first half was hurt by poor performance on the part of Kodak, General Motors and International Paper. In the second half of the year, Philip Morris, Du Pont and J.P. Morgan performed poorly."" **********Ken Barbuscio, director of marketing for Merrill Lynch Defined Asset Funds, said, ""We are committed to the Dogs of the Dow theory."" Still, Merrill has been in contact with Mr. O'Higgins to find out more about his new strategy. **********Merrill Lynch sells Dogs unit investment trusts with PaineWebber Inc., Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. Merrill Lynch and its syndicate members had $14 billion in the accounts as of this month, said Roberta Hess, a Merrill Lynch vice president. Mr. O'Higgins estimated total Dog-based investments were about $20 billion **********Ms. Hess said in 1998 the Merrill Lynch funds โ with varying start dates โ had a composite return for Dow dogs of 8.4 percent; as an example, Merrill's Dow 98 J Series dogs fund, which began Jan. 6, 1998, had a return of 8.35 percent as of Dec. 31. **********Merrill continues to market a Dogs product based on the FTSE-100 index in London, its only European dogs fund. Merrill's U.K. fund, which began Jan. 28, 1998, returned 10.76 percent as of Dec. 31. **********For further information: **********DOGS OF THE DOW WEBSITE. www.dogsofthedow.com **********MERRILL LYNCH DEFINED ASSET FUNDS.

What is more, Mexico's stock market is directly affected by the ups and downs of the U.S. stock market, which some analysts think is overpriced and likely to correct. **********But the picture becomes much more positive if you are investing for retirement in 20 years, according to Jorge Suarez-Velez, a director of Afin Securities, a unit of Grupo Financiero Banorte. He suggested splitting a $50,000 portfolio evenly between U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos, placing 60 percent of each in equities of the two countries. ""The risks of equities are strongly diminished because this is for the long term,"" he said. **********For the U.S. portion, Mr. Suarez-Velez, who is based in New York, suggested an American growth-stock mutual fund, with the requirement that it follow a buy-and-hold strategy. ""In many cases, funds in the U.S. are too pressured to beat their benchmark, and so they do too much trading and are too aggressively managed,"" he said. ""I would rather be in a fund that sticks with securities it likes for the long run."" **********He added a caveat: ""U.S. stocks in general are too expensive right now, so I would stay in cash and wait for more reasonable valuations before buying a fund. The Standard & Poor's 500 is at 30 times earnings, and that's way too rich. I'd wait for it to fall below 20 times earnings."" **********For the 40 percent fixed-income side of his American portfolio, Mr. Suarez-Velez's choice was simple: long-term U.S. Treasuries, ""because I think rates will probably fall."" **********Turning to the Mexico half of the portfolio, Mr. Suarez-Velez's strategy was quite different: for equities, buy directly a select group of individual, blue-chip Mexican companies. **********""I would go for those with low-leverage, big-cash generators, and ones that have proven that they can function well in complicated times because of sectors or products,"" he said, adding that only a handful meet his criteria. **********His list: Cifra SA, the giant, cash-rich retailer; Grupo Carso SA, a conglomerate that is ""very good at making acquisitions in bad times and turning them around;"" Gruma SA, the holding company of Maseca, Mexico's largest tortilla maker, which gets half of its sales, and hard currency, from abroad; Telefonos de Mexico, the country's telephone company, ""a good long-term bet, growing more efficient and cost conscious;"" and two beverage companies: Grupo Modelo SA, which brews Corona beer, and Grupo Continental SA, Mexico's third-largest Coca-Cola bottler. Mr. Suarez-Velez said he would divide his 60 percent equity stake more or less equally among the six. **********For the debt side, 40 percent of the peso portfolio, he suggested short-term (28-day) Cetes, government debt yielding around 36 percent in mid-December. ""Just keep rolling them over,"" he said. ""You can see the rate you're getting and it's a way to keep up with inflation."" He advised buying Cetes directly from a broker rather than buying a debt fund. ""The loads on these funds in Mexico are too high,"" he said. **********Mexicans do get some social security payments for retirement, but Mr. Suarez-Velez said it was not a very meaningful sum. It is also mandatory to put some money into retirement funds run by various financial groups, but he noted that they are restricted as to where they can invest, and own mostly government debt. **********One reason Mr. Suarez-Velez' portfolio is weighted towards debt is that equity investing is not part of the Mexican culture. ""People see it as high-risk, and they equate it with gambling,"" he said. ""But you can make the case for investing in equities, even in Mexico, if it's for the long term, which takes away the risk, and you don't try to time the market and trade."" Choose good companies with good products and a good track record, he added, and ""you will generate much higher yields than with debt."""

Wesley K. Clark, intervening to break the logjam, gave the guerrilla army a replacement force that is nominally defensive, and only lightly armed. He flew in after the NATO commander in Kosovo, Lieut. Gen. Sir Mike Jackson, failed to reach an agreement with the Albanian leaders during negotiations on Sunday night and into this morning. **********Under the deal, the guerrilla army will cease to exist and a new civil emergency service will be formed in its place. The accord is of vital importance to plans of NATO and the United Nations to establish security and contain violence in the province. **********General Clark spent the day in talks with the Kosovo Liberation Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Agim Ceku, and its political leader, Hashim Thaci. All the army's field commanders were also gathered at the NATO headquarters, perched on a hill overlooking the Kosovo capital, Pristina. **********The deal involved all the players in Kosovo. Mr. Thaci signed the agreement to transform the Kosovo Liberation Army. Bernard Kouchner, the powerful United Nations special representative in Kosovo, granted legal status to the new corps and appointed General Ceku as its provisional commander. General Jackson, who will oversee the daily operations of the new corps, signed a document laying out its operational principles. **********Just hours before, at 6 A.M., after nightlong negotiations, General Jackson emerged from his headquarters looking tired and somewhat frustrated. He laid the blame for the deadlock fully on Mr. Thaci and his commanders, and he warned of the consequences of failing to reach agreement. **********The failure of Mr. Thaci and his commanders to accept the weapons agreement ''is in danger of unsettling the future of the vast majority'' of Kosovo Liberation Army members, he said. Ordinary members were supposed to hand in their remaining weapons and cease wearing uniforms and insignia by Sunday night, but General Jackson extended that deadline. **********Except for one reported incident in eastern Kosovo, where a dozen soldiers in uniform were found outside their base after the Sunday deadline and were escorted back, the Kosovo Liberation Army appeared to have begun complying with the new rules, said Maj. Roland Lavoie, a spokesman for the allied force. **********In the morning, three issues were still under discussion: the name of the future force, the selection of its members, and the number of weapons it would be allowed to keep. **********The Kosovo Liberation Army sees the new force as the core of a future defense force or army, and wanted that recognized in the name. NATO and United Nations negotiators have repeatedly stressed the civilian aspect of the force, and wanted it to be called the Kosovo Corps. The name ultimately chosen was the Kosovo Protection Force. **********Far more contentious was the issue of weapons. The new force is to be allowed 200 sidearms, to be carried only by bodyguards and guards of ''vital and key institutions,'' according to a press release from the allied headquarters. Major Lavoie, the spokesman for the allied force, said the Kosovo Liberation Army ''put on the table a number that would be closer to 400.'' **********General Clark appeared to have persuaded the Kosovo Liberation Army to back down on the weapons issue. It is not clear, however, if they were granted the right to own personal weapons, which could increase the total number of weapons carried by members of the new corps. **********NATO, and in particular the United Nations, wary of the reaction of Russia in the Security Council, insisted on strictly limiting the number of weapons for the new force. The Kosovo Liberation Army leadership  is intent on retaining as many weapons as possible, as it is intent on forming an army in the future to defend Kosovo and ultimately achieve independence. **********The weapons issue seems to have blown up at the last minute when regional commanders realized that the weapons allowed in their regions would be under allied control, and inside allied bases and not in their own bases. **********There has been a serious play for power within the organization in recent weeks, and the formation of the Kosovo Protection Corps will illustrate who will be influential in the future. General Ceku is to head the new force, Mr. Thaci announced today, adding that the decision was approved by the general headquarters and the defense ministers of the interim government of Kosovo. It is not clear, however, if General Ceku, a Kosovo Albanian and a former general of the Croatian army, will choose to stay. **********Mr. Thaci took time out from the negotiations today to announce the formation of a new political party. He did not announce the name of the party, still under discussion, but clearly launched it as the political successor of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and the rightful owner of its legacy as the forerunner in the struggle for freedom and independence. **********The party, which according to one diplomat is tentatively named the Progressive Party for the Renaissance of Kosovo, will stand for a multiethnic society and respect for human rights, Mr. Thaci said. **********Mr. Thaci has had to delay the formation of his party while he has tried to keep key commanders on his side. As they contemplate their future and their role in the Kosovo Protection Corps, the commanders have grown more insistent in their demands. For Mr. Thaci, the agreement on the new force, and in particular the weapons issue, became a critical test. **********One diplomat likened the game to musical chairs where to stay in the game, it is essential to grab a chair. Commanders were maneuvering for positions of power, reduced to just six regions of command in the new force. ''Tomorrow at midnight the music stops and there are only six chairs,'' he said."

NATO troops, under the agreement, will be in charge of monitoring the border area. Any weapons trafficking could cause clashes between peacekeepers and armed smugglers bringing in supplies over the goat tracks and trails that wind their way through the peaks. **********Further, it will be difficult for NATO troops to identify the insurgents or warring antagonists, many of whom are often out of uniform and have already hidden caches of weapons in farm sheds and crude underground bunkers. **********The rebel leaders, many of whom have spent years in prison for separatist activities, are likely to remain hardened to Serbian promises, extremely wary of outside influence and secretive. **********That leadership is currently rife with divisions and ranges from Marxist to fascist to Islamic radicals, and as part of the peace plan it will be expected to settle, if not resolve, those differences peacefully. **********But the group's commitment to democratic governance in Kosovo is uncertain, even though the Kosovo Albanians who form its base made up 90 percent of the province's two million people before the recent expulsions began. **********Instead, the group has presented itself as a liberation movement that, as its spokesman Jakup Krasniqi said last year, did not have a political platform because, ''We do not have time for such things even if we were interested in them.'' **********But with the advent of a settlement between NATO and Yugoslavia, issues that have been put off by rebel commanders because of these divisions -- like the shape and structure of a new government in Kosovo --  will have to be addressed swiftly. **********Whether that can be done without unleashing bloodshed within their own ranks is an open question. At least two rebel commanders, Ramush Hajredinaj and another known as ''Remi,'' each based in different parts of the province, stand in open defiance of Hashim Thaci, who has emerged as the nominal head of the guerrilla force. **********While Mr. Thaci has publicly accepted the peace plan it is not clear that these men, as well as other commanders, will prove compliant, especially if disarming means ceding power to Mr. Thaci. **********Mr. Thaci, in an attempt to seize control, has already named a provisional government, with himself as prime minister and close relatives in key posts. **********The rebel group has also spawned a rival armed faction, known as the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo, funded and backed by Bujar Bukosi, who served as the self-styled prime minister of Kosovo under the leadership of Ibrahim Rugova. **********While the new group is small and poorly organized it took control of some territory last year in central Kosovo, then backed down after confrontations with superior Kosovo Liberation Army units. Its armed cadre controls slices along the border with Albania and may be able to rally disgruntled commanders to their cause, especially given the millions of dollars raised by Mr. Bukosi during his years in exile in Europe. The refusal to turn over this money to the Kosovo Liberation Army has also angered Mr. Thaci. **********With the Serbs expected to pull out of the province these factions will have to reconcile their differences peacefully, something they have been unable to do, or battle each other for control. **********The rebel group cadre frequently brand Mr. Rugova, who for nearly a decade led the struggle against Serbia and now advocates a peaceful solution, ''a traitor.'' And televised pictures of Mr. Rugova meeting Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, and apparently calling for reconciliation at the height of the bombing, has only deepened this antipathy. **********Western diplomats say that Mr. Thaci has, in a move they find troubling, already ordered the assassination of Mr. Bukosi. There have also been death threats made against Mr. Rugova by lower ranking rebel commanders, although Mr. Thaci publicly invited Mr. Rugova to join his  ''government.'' **********Those threats may be far from idle. Last year, a rebel commander was assassinated in Tirana, the Albanian capital, a killing that Western diplomats have widely attributed to rivals within the guerrilla movement."

That goal appeared likely to be met. **********As the day kicked off in a small ceremony in the Rose Garden, it carried the makings of a historic moment, with Israel and Syria standing resolutely on the brink of a new dialogue that could spell the end of a decades-long conflict. The mood quickly soured when the Syrians publicly reiterated well-worn grievances against the Israelis, signaling just how rocky the road ahead may be, but later, behind closed doors, the mood apparently sweetened once more. **********Today did begin the highest-level Israeli-Syrian talks to date, what President Clinton called ''a big step along the path'' to peace. First at the White House, then at Blair House, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel met with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria under the auspices of Mr. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. **********The face-to-face encounter sent a clear signal of intentions as both sides approached the negotiating table with a determination to see things through to an eventual accord.  A firm desire to make peace was voiced by both sides, and Mr. Clinton urged them to seize the moment and present him by Thursday with an itinerary for their peacemaking, a  senior administration official said. **********By late tonight, an Israeli official reported, Mr. Barak was in good spirits, indicating that the atmosphere at the negotiations had been positive and productive, and that both sides seemed willing to go forward. **********Early this morning it was almost startling to see the Israeli and Syrian officials file out and take their places side by side in the wet grass behind the White House this morning. One senior Israeli official chatted amiably with one of the Syrians, as if small talk between the two sides were an everyday occurrence. **********Then Mr. Barak, Mr. Shara and Mr. Clinton marched out in their somber suits and did a little shuffle. Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara apparently reversed their assigned positions alongside Mr. Clinton, until Mr. Barak said, with a fleeting smile, ''I think we have to change,'' and they did. **********From there on, it was downhill, an inauspicious start. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak did as planned, giving short, idealistic speeches about the desire for peace and the difficulty of securing it. Mr. Shara, on the other hand, launched into a substantial summary of Syria's grievances. **********He cleared his throat, and took advantage of a rare platform. Making excuses for speaking at relative length on such a cold day, Mr. Shara argued that the Israeli occupation  was the root of all misery, not just Syrian misery but Israeli misery as well. **********''It goes without saying that peace for Syria means the return of all its occupied land,'' he said, ''while for Israel, peace will mean the end of the psychological fear that the Israelis have been living in as a result of the existence of occupation, which is undoubtedly the source of all adversities and wars.'' **********As Mr. Shara spoke those words, Mr. Barak clasped his hands, pursed his lips and stared forward without expression. American officials shifted uneasily from foot to foot. A senior Israeli official later said the Israelis were upset by Mr. Shara's nonconciliatory tone, which quickly and jarringly broke the mood. **********Mr. Clinton had talked broadly and hopefully, pronouncing this a juncture unlike any other in the long Israeli-Arab peacemaking effort. ''For the first time in history, there is a chance of a comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria, and, indeed, all its neighbors,'' he said. **********He praised the resolve of both Mr. Barak, whom he called ''an exceptional hero in war'' who is now ''a determined soldier for peace,'' and President Hafez el-Assad of Syria, who also ''has known the cost of war.'' Without such adornments, he referred to Mr. Shara as ''an able representative'' of his people. **********Then, very succinctly, Mr. Barak reiterated his broad intentions in pursuing peace, making a point to refer to the Syrians as ''our partners.'' **********''We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step forward toward peace,'' he said in a three-sentence statement. **********Mr. Shara, though, refused to be stage-managed. He spoke with apparent awareness of his audience at home and throughout the Arab world. He gave the impression that he could not let himself be manipulated by the Israeli and the Americans into performing on cue, not as he was entering negotiations in which Syria would take the exceptional step of accepting the permanence of the Jewish homeland. **********He proclaimed that now as ever before, all Syria wanted was to reclaim ''all its occupied land,'' that is, the Golan Heights, the strategic plateau that Israel seized during the 1967 war. He criticized the media at large for portraying Syria as ''the aggressor,'' the one ''who shelled settlements from the Golan prior to the 1967 war. **********''These claims carry no grain of truth,'' he said, taking the inflammatory step of citing the memoirs of Moshe Dayan, the legendary Israeli general, as proof: ''As Moshe Dayan himself explained in his memoirs, it was the other side who insisted on provoking the Syrians until they clashed together and then they claimed that the Syrians are the aggressors.'' **********Mr. Shara also made it clear that the Syrians still wanted to pick up negotiations where they felt they had been broken off in 1996. The Syrians maintain that Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli prime minister, had promised that Israel would withdraw from the full Golan Heights, down to the border of June 4, 1967. **********That, in the Syrians' interpretation, extended to the shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. The Israelis deny that this promise was ever made, and dispute the interpretation of the border. **********''If these talks are to succeed as rapidly as we all desire, no one should ignore what has been achieved until now,'' he said. **********At the same time, Mr. Shara did embrace the idealism of peace, which he said could not only end violence in the region but also ''usher in a dialogue of civilization and honorable competition in various domains -- the political, cultural, scientific and economic.'' **********And he also posed an intellectual question, as if he were already reflecting backward from the vantage point of a resolved conflict: Would the Israeli-Arab conflict be what ''defined'' or ''frustrated'' Arab unity? **********In Israeli-Arab peace negotiations, there is often a good deal of public posturing aimed at the audiences back home. Sometimes, belligerent words mask real progress at the table. **********Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara met for a total of just under two hours, but never, as had been expected, without the Americans present. They started in a trilateral meeting with Mr. Clinton in the Oval Office, picking up again in a three-way meeting with Ms. Albright. The Israelis and the Syrians agreed to let the White House speak publicly about the very sensitive talks so as not to harm whatever progress was made with public comments. **********Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said that in the meeting with Mr. Clinton, both sides ''raised their positions and concerns while acknowledging that the other side's concerns needed to be addressed.'' **********''Both parties displayed a serious intent,'' he said."

His bejeweled fingers flashed as he waved to the people on shore. A servant held an umbrella aloft to shade him from a blazing sun. **********For almost a decade, Laloo, as he is universally known, has ruled India's poorest and second most populous state with a sly, rustic wit. He had come here to seek the votes of country people in India's monthlong national elections. Voting largely concludes Sunday, with counting on Wednesday and Thursday. **********When this son of an illiterate cowherd first came to power in the northern state of Bihar in March 1990, he symbolized the rise of India's peasant castes to the political heights -- and the hope that this new generation of leaders would improve the lives of people long dominated by the ruling upper castes. **********Mr. Yadav's theatrical defiance of the elite and his elevation of his own caste members to high government position have given many poor people a feeling for the first time that they have a place in democracy. **********But with the passage of years, the hope that Mr. Yadav's brand of populism would materially improve the common people's standard of living has been dashed. In the 1990's, as India's national Government has loosened its viselike grip on the economy and business people have been given more freedom about where to invest, the gap between the richest and poorest states has widened, with Bihar bringing up the rear. **********While leaders in other states have courted private investors, cut budget deficits and built roads and power grids, Mr. Yadav, who heads his party, and his wife, Rabri Devi, who has replaced him as Chief Minister while he faces public corruption charges, have let Bihar slide further into debt. Roads are crumbling. Electrical power is in acutely short supply. And the state has attracted virtually no foreign investment. **********Mr. Yadav, 51, still glories in his folk-hero status like a bantam rooster and conjures the symbols of rural life with a showman's mastery. He lets his billy goats graze in the rose garden of the Chief Minister's mansion. He thumbs his nose at the Brahmans and extols the virtues of cow dung on the floor of Parliament. And as he picks his toes and squirts chewing tobacco juice from the side of his mouth, he never lets anyone forget that he was once a shoeless farm boy who is missing toenails because water buffalo stomped on his feet. **********But he and his wife have offered no broad vision for building the economy or curbing population growth. In fact, they had nine children because the first six were girls and his mother, like most Indians, favored boys. **********The state's failure to progress may finally be taking a toll on Mr. Yadav's and Ms. Devi's popularity. A recent poll found that 70 percent of Bihar's voters are dissatisfied with the state government. **********The current election will test whether their alliance of Muslims and Yadavs, the large caste of cowherds and small farmers, coupled with some support from other low castes, can retain power. **********Mr. Yadav's party, which governs Bihar in an alliance with the national Congress Party, is opposed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which is largely dependent on upper-caste voters in Bihar, and that party's state-level allies, who now include another low-caste leader. **********''The only explanation for Laloo's continuing hold on power seems to be that he's a powerful symbol for the masses who support him,'' said Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at Notre Dame. **********In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, northern states where a quarter of India's one billion people live, the so-called ''backward castes'' -- above the lowest castes of untouchables, but beneath the upper ranks of Brahmans and traders -- have yet to move beyond the politics of patronage and symbolism and secure better health, education and job prospects. **********As economic growth surged across India this decade, Bihar, with a mostly rural population of 100 million, remained what Abusaleh Shariff, a noted economist, called ''a black hole right on the face of the earth.'' **********Bihar's economy has stagnated despite its wealth of natural resources. Its residents have left in droves to hunt for jobs elsewhere. More than half the people are illiterate and grindingly poor. Almost two-thirds of the children age 4 or younger are stunted by malnutrition. **********Bihar has managed to get food grains that are heavily subsidized by the national Government to only 1 out of every 20 households, while states in south India are consistently reaching 7 or 8 out of every 10. **********Meanwhile, Bihar's reputation for public corruption has deepened. Mr. Yadav was charged in 1996 in what he says is a conspiracy trumped up by his opponents. This favorite son of the cowherds' caste has been accused of conspiring with state officials to steal vast sums from a state agricultural program that is meant to help struggling farmers. **********The day before Mr. Yadav went to jail in 1997, his party installed his wife, Ms. Devi, a village woman with a fifth-grade education, as Chief Minister. Freed on bail and with a raft of cases pending against him, Mr. Yadav won a seat in Parliament in 1998 and continues to serve as the president of his state-based party, the Rashtriya Janta Dal, which, in Hindi, means National People's Party. **********To visit his parliamentary constituency in the desperately poor northeastern part of the state is to travel back into a feudal time. The 160-mile journey along the pockmarked macadam from the state capital of Patna to his district takes eight bone-jarring hours. After heavy rains, every crater is full of water. Swarms of mosquitoes rise from the pavement. **********Except for an occasional police jeep or tractor, motor vehicles virtually disappear. The roads teem with rickshaws and bicycles, ox carts and jangling horses and buggies, and men in loincloths and women in saris trudging along with scythes and hoes over their shoulders. **********Mr. Yadav does not drive to his district from Patna, but zips in by helicopter and takes over the large home of a local hotelier. One recent morning, a crowd of supplicants and party workers gathered outside the bedroom where he and his wife were ensconced. The crowd craned for a peek into the room as a parade of servants carried in tray after tray of breakfast food, plates of spicy vegetables and pots of yogurt. **********About 9 A.M., Mr. Yadav, a compact man with a jiggling belly, emerged in a pristine white shirt and pants. As he sat in a chair, furiously plotting strategy with his cronies, men touched his feet reverently. **********As he held forth, servants came bearing a small tray of betel leaf, betel nuts and tobacco. **********Mr. Yadav clearly loves an audience. After he finished the campaign business, he sketched out the conspiracy against him for listeners who jostled to get near. The Hindu nationalists, in league with the multinationals and ''American money,'' had bought off the news media and rigged the exit polls against the Congress Party alliance he was part of, he said. **********''That is the American money, the multinational money,'' he said, his words garbled by his full cheek of tobacco. ''I will ask my people to boycott the goods of multinationals. I do not want to make India a consumer of the world. They are destroying employment of the masses.'' **********He headed out for a long day of campaigning. After his first stop, he had to go by boat to reach the village of Jagdishpur because the bridge had been washed out during floods. **********Once he arrived, Mr. Yadav mounted a platform beneath a spreading peepul tree, where barefoot boys dangled from the branches. A crowd of thousands materialized from rice paddies and villages. **********''Laloo Prasad Yadav is the Indian Mandela,'' he boasted from the stage, as he directed the weathered people before him to sit on the ground with a wave of his hand. **********Then, with his chest puffed out, his head thrown back and his finger raised, Mr. Yadav, holder of a law degree, declared in rising bursts of words: ''Like you, I slept on a dirt floor. I grazed my cows. I prepared the cattle feed. I faced all the poverty of life, but I worked for you. And because you backed me, I became the Chief Minister.'' **********After the speech, he got into an air conditioned car that was waiting, and his caravan of a dozen vehicles moved on to the next roadside rally. **********The crowds applauded the Laloo show, but along this stretch of road, there seemed to be little genuine enthusiasm. None of those interviewed, even Mr. Yadav's supporters, said they were much better off now than when he first took power. **********Surender Shah, a teacher bumping along the road on his bicycle, said his village will vote against Mr. Yadav because it still has no electricity and the local school, for 300 students in grades 1 through 8, consists only of 2 decrepit classrooms. **********Dashrath Mandal, an illiterate laborer, said he has got a little more wheat and rice from the Government in recent years, but his struggles to educate his youngest son through the eighth grade have yielded only bitterness and unemployment. Mr. Mandal said he cannot afford the bribes it takes to buy a small-time government position. **********''Everywhere we go for jobs, people ask us for money, and we don't have it,'' he said. **********But even small scraps of government aid are important to the poor here, so Mr. Mandal will vote for Laloo. ''This is a Yadav constituency,'' he said matter-of-factly as he sat on a bamboo platform in his cow shed eating flat bread and fish from a tin plate. ''We have to vote for the person who is winning.''"

They're trying to beat traffic, but not to nab a place in the sun. Mr. and Mrs. Nannetti search the shore for buried objects as they wear headsets and hold their Minelab Excalibur metal detectors. When the monotonous tone in their headsets rises in pitch and volume, they know they've struck something. And by 10, when the sun is starting to climb in the sky and the tanning is getting good, they're gone. **********''When I was young, I was very interested in history and archeology,'' Mr. Nannetti said. ''This is almost an extension of a mini-archeological dig. You have no idea what you're going to find.'' **********The Nannettis rarely find more than a few salt-caked coins or the occasional class ring, which they try to return. ''We do it for the enjoyment, not for monetary value,'' said Mr. Nannetti, who counts an unopened six-pack of beer as one of his most memorable finds since he started using metal detectors in 1971. **********In the hopeful world of metal detecting, it's an aluminum pull tab today, but maybe a gold ring tomorrow. The question for the average beachgoer who may occasionally see someone sweeping the sand is: How does a metal detector distinguish between the two? **********All metal detectors are based on one principle: metal reacts to a magnetic field. A metal detector runs electric current through a transmitting coil to create an electromagnetic field that extends under the surface of the ground and changes direction several thousand times per second. If that field comes in contact with metal, it induces electric currents in the metal, which in turn create a magnetic field. **********The effect of that secondary magnetic field is picked up by the metal detector's receiver coil (unless it is a model with a single coil that handles both functions), which takes into account the current induced in it by the magnetic field transmitted by the detector, dismissing that as background and looking for the signal generated by a piece of metal in the ground. The detector's electronic components pick up that current and amplify and interpret it, then signal the user with sound or a visual display. Metals that don't conduct electricity well but are easily magnetized can also generate a strong signal because they are magnetized by the detector's magnetic field. **********Today most hobbyists, known to their fellow searchers as detectorists or T.H.'ers (for treasure hunters), use Very Low Frequency detectors. A V.L.F. detector works, like earlier models, by creating a field and transmitting it into the ground and receiving information about distortions in these fields caused by metallic objects. The frequency, between 6 and 70 kilohertz, refers to the number of times per second the magnetic field changes direction. **********Some models are able to reject highly magnetic minerals, like iron, that are simply part of the soil, which foiled the older machines. V.L.F. detectors can also take a guess at the depth of the object by the strength of the distortion signal. The larger the object, the stronger the current induced in the receiver coil. **********The popular V.L.F. detectors have different types of electronic components than older models. Vacuum tubes were used by some of the older technologies popular in the 1960's and 70's, like beat frequency oscillator (B.F.O.) detectors. Later detectors use transistors, and miniaturization of components has meant that modern models can include more analytical electronics, like integrated circuits and microprocessors. V.L.F. detectors emit a steady electromagnetic field, while a type of device called a Pulse Induction detector emits a field in pulses. **********Microprocessors are used in metal detectors manufactured by companies like Garrett Electronics, White's Electronics and Minelab Electronics. Midrange metal detectors generally cost $300 to $1,200. The user can instruct the processor to look for different types of metals at various depths. Processors can also learn to ignore certain objects by storing information about the signal the object produces. **********Although many detector enthusiasts extol the thrill of the find and either return items or save them as collectibles, some sell what they find to dealers, collectors and pawnshops. ''Found! 100 Gold Coins worth $36,000!'' and ''$4,375 Gold Nugget!'' are the types of headlines that can be found on the covers of Western and Eastern Treasures, a magazine for detector fans. **********Although searching a public beach for lost jewelry and coins is generally permitted under state laws, metal detecting in state and Federal parks and historical sites is not. People with detectors who hunt for Civil War and Revolutionary War relics (like uniform buttons and bullets) in landmark battlefields can disrupt these areas irrevocably if they start digging up what they detect, said Veletta Canouts, deputy program manager for archeology and ethnography for the National Parks Service. **********''Unless you're working within some legitimate excavation planning process, there's little way of knowing the context of what you're digging up,'' Ms. Canouts said. ''And once you destroy an archeological site, you can't put it back together again.'' **********People who use detectors recreationally have to abide by Federal laws like the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, which says any item found on public property is protected by the Government and is not the property of the finder. Some states protect items more than 100 years old found on private property. **********The metal detecting community, which includes hundreds of regional organizations as well as the Federation of Metal Detectors and Archeological Clubs, a national group, discourages illegal searches. **********''There are a few bad apples out there who trespass and remove artifacts without permission,'' Mr. Nannetti said. ''The best we can do is tell them we don't agree with what they're doing and try to get them to stop so that they don't spoil it for the rest of us.''"

''The airline has suffered enough, and it is time that the pilots suffer along with us.'' **********American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, announced that it had canceled 1,102 of its 2,250 scheduled flights and that the number of pilots calling in sick had risen slightly for the second consecutive day, despite Judge Kendall's order. **********The continued sickout insured snarls for tens of thousands of American passengers not just yesterday but for today and tomorrow as well. **********Timothy Ahern, American's vice president for operations and planning, said if all the pilots had returned to work yesterday, Monday was the the soonest the airline could have been back to normal. **********Eager to avoid a contempt citation, Rich LaVoy, president of the union, told Judge Kendall that he had done his best to persuade American's pilots to return to work. **********''I've done everything except go to their house and knock on their doors,'' Mr. LaVoy said, adding that he would do more to get the message out, even ''if I have to drive around with a loudspeaker on top of my car.'' **********But when Judge Kendall learned that 12 of the union's 18 board members had called in sick yesterday, he scoffed at the union's assertions that it was doing its utmost to persuade the pilots to return. **********The pilots have staged their job action to protest the speed with which American plans to integrate Reno Air, a small Western carrier it purchased in December, into the larger airline's network. The pilots fear that American will rely increasingly on Reno's lower-paid pilots, thus undercutting the American pilots. But the airline insists it has no such intention, saying it plans to bring the Reno pilots up to the American pay scale within 18 months. **********At yesterday's hearing, Judge Kendall showed little sympathy for the pilots, who earn about $140,000 a year on average. ''When you call in sick and get paid for it and you're really not, is that not stealing?'' he asked, saying it was dishonorable for so many pilots, many of them veterans of the armed services, to act in such a way. **********Mr. Lavoy denied the pilots were stealing. He said that the union's net assets were between $36 million and $38 million. **********After the hearing ended, Mr. LaVoy said: ''We are trying our best to comply with Judge Kendall's order. We are urging our pilots to get back in the cockpit.'' **********American officials told the judge that the airline had lost about $40 million as a result of the standoff. **********The White House commented for the first time yesterday about the dispute, saying that it was closely monitoring the situation. In a statement, President Clinton said: ''I am concerned about the impact this labor dispute is having on our nation and the traveling public. With the potential for enormous disruption over the upcoming Presidents' Day holiday weekend, I urge both parties to think of the impact on the traveling public, set aside their differences, and work together to resolve the issues between them.'' **********As a result of the daylong hearing, which was attended by the union's leaders, the two sides did not hold negotiations scheduled for yesterday afternoon."

This system operates amid an intense price war in which Vodafone has consistently beaten Cellnet, the No. 2 mobile phone operator. Cellnet added 658,000 users in the last quarter of 1998, 455,000 of them on pay-as-you-go services. Orange and One to One are also rivals in the market. **********Vodafone was spun off from Racal Electronics in 1988 with a market value of $:1.7 billion. Along with Cellnet, it dominated the British mobile phone market, drawing heavy criticism from customers about high prices. By last July, it had outperformed the market fivefold and ranks among the most successful British companies of the 1990's. It is one of the nation's top 10 companies in market value, and its management style is generally described as highly enthusiastic and assertive. **********The main criticism from investors is that Vodafone emphasizes the gaining of customers in its home market rather than profit per customer. Its results for the six-month period ending on Sept. 30, reported in November, showed a 60 percent increase in annual pretax profit, to $:476.9 million on sales of $:1.562 billion, a 34 percent increase compared with results in the period a year earlier. But that surge did not disguise the fact that the increase in profit in its home market was only 7 percent, to $:303 million -- a figure that set back share prices in November. The company said at the time that price battles cost it $:110 million and that a further $:35 million had been spent on acquiring customers. **********Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, said in November that he expected ''total market penetration in all the markets in which we operate to reach 50 percent by the end of 2003, a year earlier than we projected last year.'' **********Vodafone's customers outside Britain are mainly in Northern and Western Europe, notably Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands. The European operations of Airtouch Communications, the American company Vodafone is seeking to acquire, are mainly in Southern Europe -- Spain, Italy and Portugal. **********Vodafone said on Monday that in the last quarter of 1998, it acquired 862,000 net new customers outside its British market. That brought its customer base to 4.87 million in Britain and 4.26 million outside Britain, for a total of 9.13 million."

Suez is powerful in municipal water treatment and energy systems, but it has been a laggard in the industrial market, particularly in the United States. By adding Nalco, he said, Suez can sell water treatment, energy and other services that corporations increasingly outsource, or contract out. **********''We can use Nalco's client base to establish ourselves as an outsourcing partner in the United States,'' he said. ''And later, we can transfer what we've learned to Europe.'' **********The deal, which was reported in The Wall Street Journal, comes at a time of rapid change among water treatment companies. The industries they serve -- steel, paper and the like -- have been consolidating, yielding much larger customers with formidable purchasing power, and with a zeal for farming out the management of their entire water systems, from intake to disposal. **********''We're all dealing with larger customers and larger competitors, and we're being asked to provide a much broader array of programs and services,'' said Edward J. Mooney, the chairman of Nalco. **********In the last couple of years Hercules has bought Betz Dearborn, Ciba Specialty Chemicals bought Allied Colloids of Britain, and Vivendi S.A., Suez Lyonnaise's main rival in France, bought U.S. Filter. Two weeks ago Suez itself said it would buy the Calgon Corporation, a Pittsburgh water company. **********''As soon as they bought Calgon, it made sense they'd want even greater critical mass,'' said Christopher Bodnar, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. **********Many analysts had speculated that Ciba or Ashland Inc., which has a small water subsidiary, might go after Nalco, or that Nalco might turn acquirer and buy Cytec, a smaller company. In fact, Cytec's stock moved up $3.1875 after the Nalco deal was announced, and analysts said it was because Cytec was one of the few potential acquisition targets left. **********Although the Nalco acquisition will not add to Suez's earnings until the second year, the companies say they have already spotted $100 million in potential synergies, including cutting costs, increasing sales by selling full-service packages and and combining purchasing. **********Job cuts will certainly be part of the equation, but the ax is not likely to hit hard in Naperville, Ill., Nalco's headquarters. Suez plans to combine the operations of Nalco, Calgon and Aquazur, its internal water treatment company, into a $3 billion company that will operate under the Nalco Chemical name, and be based in Naperville. Mr. Mooney will be the new company's chief executive."

Why not front and center? To the titans of French chic, Women's Wear Daily was little more than a trade rag devoted to ladies suits and corsets. **********Mr. Fairchild changed all that. Asked yesterday what he did to improve his seating -- and raise the stature of his trade publication so that in time it became known as ''the Bible of fashion'' -- Mr. Fairchild laughed and said, ''I got mad.'' **********Although Mr. Fairchild, who retired in 1996, would not comment on news of the pending sale of Fairchild Publications, which is owned by Walt Disney, to Conde Nast, he seemed to favor such an acquisition. ''If the sale goes through, my reaction is they will get the jewels,'' he said, referring to the likelihood that Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications that owns Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour, will have Women's Wear Daily and its sister publication, W. **********Under Mr. Fairchild, who became publisher in 1960, Women's Wear Daily became as feared as it was ruthlessly observant of the changing social scene. He discovered that the most interesting people on Seventh Avenue were not the manufacturers, but the unheralded designers behind the scenes, people like Bill Blass, who were often at chic parties with their clients. Women's Wear Daily helped create the cult of celebrity that developed around designers. **********''He was very changeable, and a lot depended on who he last spoke to,'' said June Weir, a former Women's Wear Daily fashion editor. **********But it was news, and a sense of the new in fashion, that gave Women's Wear Daily (and later W) its provocative edge, and that could make or break a designer. A former staff member recalled that Mr. Fairchild and an editor once chided a designer for planning elaborate hats with his clothes. The designer took the advice, but in Women's Wear Daily's glowing review of his collection that followed, the headline said, ''Hats Off!'' **********If Women's Wear Daily and W created excitement around fashion and its ever-changing cast of characters, its feuds were also legend, whether with Geoffrey Beene, Yves Saint Laurent or Giorgio Armani. Norman Norell, once hailed by Women's Wear Daily as ''Fashion Great,'' was eventually diminished to ''Old Master.'' **********''With Fairchild,'' said Carrie Donovan, a former fashion editor at Vogue and The New York Times, ''everything was personal; yet he never missed the news.'' **********Under Patrick McCarthy, the current chairman and editorial director, the personal is not so apparent -- or as capricious. **********Asked if he thought Women's Wear Daily still had bite, Mr. Fairchild demurred and said with a laugh, ''Times have changed, and maybe I was wrong.'' He added, ''Back then, we were fighting for our survival.''"

They don't ask about politics or security. They want to know what would happen if Microsoft moved into the election business. **********Mr. Adler has a ready reply: ''Do you think the Justice Department would let Microsoft run elections in this country?'' **********Votehere.net, which is based in Kirkland, Wash., is one of a handful of companies that are building systems to enable voters to cast ballots over the Internet. Since no states allow Internet voting -- few are even in the earliest stages of contemplating it -- the companies are focusing their efforts on building the trust of election officials in their products and reputations. **********Votehere.net is new to the industry, but most of these companies are already in the election business, selling voting machines and computer equipment for reading ballot results, and they are anticipating demand for Internet voting software. **********''Our primary focus is on continuing to sell our products and to participate in the evolution,'' said Steve Knecht, western regional manager for Global Election Systems. ''This is going to be a slow process.'' **********Global, based in McKinney, Tex., sells touch-screen voting systems and equipment that scans ballot results into computers. The company has also developed software to demonstrate how an Internet voting system would work. **********The companies developing Internet voting products plan initially to sell to nongovernmental users like universities, unions and professional associations. On-line elections among those groups, company officials hope, will build public trust and brand recognition that will serve the companies well if and when legislatures approve on-line voting in the biggest potential market, civic elections. **********As it stands, only a few state legislatures have begun to address Internet voting. Bills to initiate studies of the concept were introduced recently in Minnesota and Washington State. **********In California, the Legislature passed a bill to study the issue in 1997, but it was vetoed by the Governor then, Pete Wilson, because of fears of fraud and vote-tampering. In March, the California Secretary of State, Bill Jones, convened a task force to study the issue and make recommendations to the Legislature later this year. Florida election officials had planned to test on-line voting systems in elections this fall, but the project was delayed indefinitely after cases of voter fraud in Miami raised fears about security. **********On the Federal level, the Pentagon, in an effort to make it easier for far-flung military personnel to participate in elections, is sponsoring a pilot program through the Federal Voting Assistance Program. The experiment will enable overseas residents of five states -- Florida, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas and Utah -- both military and civilian, to vote by way of the Internet in 2000. **********With the inevitable political starts and stops on this issue, five years could pass before any state election officials are authorized to buy Internet voting systems. Moreover, the first civic election held by Internet will attract substantial scrutiny. Any problems -- from a breach in security to a glitch in tabulation -- could prove disastrous for the company that builds the system. **********Still, the companies entering the field accept those risks. **********''It's absolutely imperative that it work right the first time, so we are approaching cautiously,'' said Neil McClure, president of Worldwide Election Systems in Lafayette, Colo. **********To Mr. McClure, improved security is one of the best reasons for Internet voting. ''Any Internet voting system is going to be light years ahead of a punch-card system in terms of security,'' he said. ''Those ballots are handled by human beings. The count could change by the mere fact that the ballots were handled.'' **********The three-year-old company has designed an Internet voting system that can be integrated with its electronic voting machines (although none of its products are yet on the market). The company has spent a year adapting encryption technology to insure the system's security. Still, the company's strategy is to add on-line voting capacity to conventional vote machines -- not to offer Internet voting software as a stand-alone product. **********''It's not like we're betting the company on this,'' Mr. McClure said. **********To a large degree, however, Votehere. net is betting the company on Internet voting. Though developing these systems is a logical direction for companies in the election business, Votehere.net came to the field for very different reasons. The company started in 1996 as Soundcode, which developed data security software. But Mr. Adler saw that field increasingly dominated by large companies like Network Associates and Security Dynamics. **********So he put three engineers in the nine-person company to work applying their encryption to an Internet voting system. They spent a year on the project, and now patents for the product are pending. **********''We could be eaten alive or move into a market that's new and bold,'' Mr. Adler said. **********Companies already in the election business say that technology companies like Votehere.net are at a disadvantage because they have not dealt with the politics behind the development of election systems and the requirements that vary from county to county. **********''There are only a few companies nationwide that understand the election business,'' Mr. Knecht of Global said. ''There are many, many companies interested in Internet voting that have little understanding of election law.'' **********Mr. Adler, for one, is willing to learn. His company's research shows that election officials nationwide spend $1 billion a year on equipment for election day. But he recognizes that the business of handling election data carries an exceptional burden of responsibility. ''You have the spotlight on you all the time,'' he said. ''You have to be squeaky clean.''"

It also said company activities would not be affected by what the company called a private matter between Mr. Cowpland and the securities commission. **********In mid-1997, Corel, best known for its WordPerfect and CorelDraw software, had indicated to investment analysts that third-quarter sales would be about $94 million (United States). During the first week of August, the securities commission said, Mr. Cowpland was told by his staff that sales would only amount to about $63 million, although this was not publicly disclosed. **********According to the securities commission, Mr. Cowpland then instructed his sales staff to place inventory with Corel's largest distributor to make up the shortfall, even though the distributor's inventories were already high. **********Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Mr. Cowpland sold about 2.4 million Corel shares at prices ranging from $8.20 to $8.80 (Canadian) a share. **********A week later, the securities commission says, the distributor agreed to buy $70 million (United States) worth of software, but Corel also agreed to accept returns of $18 million worth of goods. In early September 1997, the commission says, Corel realized that much of its $70 million sale could not be booked for the quarter and in a press release the company said it expected to report a loss of $32 million. **********Some investors sensed trouble in advance of Corel's press release warning of the loss. In the three weeks between Mr. Cowpland's stock sales and the company's statement the stock fell to $6.80 (Canadian) from $8.90. **********Over the following three weeks it slipped as low as $5.05 (Canadian)."

Warnings from investigators to take away the security clearance of the lead suspect, Wen Ho Lee, ''were conversations that must have taken place between the F.B.I. and the Department of Energy,'' he said, leaving the impression that he was not involved in the decision. The suspect was not fired until last week, after The New York Times reported on the investigation. **********At the same time, Mr. Berger said today, ''There's no question that they've benefited from this.'' **********In response to the growing criticism of how they handled the case, Administration officials now say they conducted 17 briefings of Congressional intelligence committees in recent years that included information about the theft. Representative Porter J. Goss, Republican of Florida, has said in recent days that the briefings included information on the Los Alamos case. But Mr. Goss, a former C.I.A. officer who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, insisted today that the information was ''not highlighted and it was underplayed.'' **********Mr. Goss said that the Administration was giving ''a little bit more attention'' to counterintelligence now, adding, ''I think if we keep the pressure on, we will indeed understand that national security is more important than trade.''"

The study looked at everything from the number of Internet connections per person to the impact of organized crime on business. **********Denmark came out on top, earning top marks (an 87.3 rating on a scale of 100) because of strong economic performance, low health-care costs, a low crime rate and a small percentage of people living below the poverty line. **********Austria came in second with a score of 87.2, primarily because of good marks for environmental protection and high youth employment. **********Ireland, with an 87.0 rating, placed third and drew plaudits because ""it combines the highest growth rate in Europe with relatively little pollution and gets good grades on the dimensions of health, employment and education,"" the study said. **********At the bottom was Italy, with a 75.0 rating. It was described as a ""laggard"" because it suffers from high unemployment and a business environment hampered by organized crime. **********Canada, the United States and Japan, the non-European members of the Group of Seven industrial nations, ranked in the middle. **********Canada had an 85.5 rating, the United States followed with 84.4, and Japan scored 83.5. **********""Many would have expected the Anglo-Saxon economies to score higher,"" said David Morrison, a World Economic Forum staffer who helped coordinate the study. **********While the United States scored well in areas such as economic growth, education and technology, it scored poorly in three areas โ pollution, health-care costs and crime. **********Mr. Morrison described the report as ""a first cut aimed at stimulating debate.""

His larynx and tongue were swelling and his breathing was strained. **********One student placed a plastic resuscitator to aid breathing over the patient's mouth. Another grabbed a syringe and administered a dose of adrenaline, medication that increases circulation and widens the airways. But the drug sent the patient's heart  racing so fast that it went into an abnormal rhythm and suddenly stopped pumping. **********''There is no pulse,'' said Janelle Massiah, one of the students. ''We need to defibrillate.'' **********The students applied shocks to the patient's chest. Within a second, the heart started again. The vital signs on a nearby computer screen began to return to normal. In a few minutes, the patient seemed to be breathing without effort. **********''All right, I think we caught it just in time,'' said Keith Adamik, another student, as he removed the resuscitator from the patient's face. **********Most students in medical education would never have such real-life interaction with a child in the throes of a severe respiratory attack. But these students were not dealing with a live child at all. They were interacting with a machine -- a plastic mannequin, equipped with sensors, circuits, tubes and pumps, that simulates the reactions of a child 5 to 7 years old. **********Nursing and medical schools have been using mannequins and simulated body parts for decades, but many are simply pieces of plastic that are not equipped to simulate responses. Many schools also use interactive computer programs that emulate medical emergencies on a computer screen, without any physical representation of a patient. **********In the last few years, however, computerized simulators that react eerily like real people have become more commonplace. Companies like Medical Educational Technologies Inc., in Sarasota, Fla., and Medsim-Eagle Simulation, in Binghamton, N.Y., are supplying schools with the virtual patients. **********The mannequin in use on Friday, which was designed to simulate the physiology of a child, is one of the latest versions. Called a pediatric simulator, it works in conjunction with a box of electronic equipment and a portable computer. **********It is one of a half-dozen simulators that Medical Educational Technologies is installing this fall at schools of medicine and nursing around the country. The company also makes an adult simulator that is in use at nearly 100 medical schools, nursing schools, community colleges and military training sites. **********''Students have virtually no opportunity to practice in real life on children,'' said Lou Oberndorf, president of the company. ''The consequence is that when a real emergency happens, it very well may be the first time they are working with a child.'' **********In the Pediasim, physical characteristics -- like the size of the airways and lungs -- are scaled down to the size of a child's. The software has also been adapted to include drug reactions and emergency situations that typically affect children, like allergic reactions and respiratory ailments. **********The Pediasim works by responding to commands that are entered on a computer and then transmitted to the mannequin. **********In the scenario faced by the students at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, Professor Neil Rodia had set up the software to demonstrate what might happen if a young boy came into an emergency room with an allergic reaction to peanuts. **********When the students were introduced to the virtual patient, the computer sent signals to the Pediasim that caused a balloon within its tongue to expand, simulating swelling. That cut off air to the lungs, which actually inhale air and exhale carbon dioxide. Using stethoscopes applied to tiny speakers embedded in the mannequin, the students could hear the sounds of the patient's heart and lungs, choreographed by the software. The mannequin does not have a heart, but electronic equipment stored within a box nearby sends electrical pulses to spots on the chest and the wrists. **********Other features include eyelids that can be opened and closed for clinical inspection and pupils that dilate or contract in response to either light or software commands. The pressure of fluids moving through tubes in the mannequin can simulate blood pressure and can be measured by a monitor wrapped around the arm. The tongue can be depressed to allow for intubation, the process of inserting a tube into the patient's windpipe. Clinicians often have more difficulty intubating children than adults because the airways are smaller; sometimes the tube is inserted into the esophagus by mistake. **********The Pediasim also has the ability to simulate the effect of various medications. The simulator comes with bar-coded syringes, with each bar code representing a different drug. The mannequin measures the amount of fluid injected and reads the type of medication with a bar-code scanner. The computer then sends signals back to the virtual body to cause it to react physically to the injection. **********Professors can manipulate the programs to create a number of scenarios, like an adverse reaction to a drug or no reaction at all. **********''You can rig it so that even if students are doing it properly, the patient may still have no response,'' Dr. Rodia said. **********The result is a far better teaching scenario, Dr. Rodia said, than simply asking students to read books and listen to lectures about what might happen in different situations. Even when students go into hospital rotations to see real-life emergencies, he said, ''they usually just stand back and watch.'' **********Medical Education Technologies sells the Pediasim -- including the mannequin, electronics box and software -- to community colleges for $160,000 and to medical schools, which use simulators with additional features, for $175,000. The adult version costs roughly the same amount, although a college that already has an adult version can buy the Pediasim mannequin and software for $35,000 and plug it into its existing equipment. **********Researchers at the company are now investigating how they might create a virtual baby that is less than 6 months old. ''We'll have to shrink our technology even further,'' Mr. Oberndorf said."

''In order for there to be a credible NATO threat, the NATO countries have indicated they won't participate in that military operation unless the United States also participates.'' **********There is also the matter of the Kosovo Albanians, who lost autonomy in Yugoslavia ten years ago and who have been victims of Serbian massacres in the last year. **********Mr. Cohen said the Kosovo Albanians ''would not feel confident of having a NATO force that doesn't have some representation by the United States,'' believing that American troops would insulate them from attacks by Serb forces. **********The Administration continued drawing up details of a possible air campaign should the warring parties fail to reach a cease-fire agreement, and for Americans to join a peacekeeping force should a cease-fire be negotiated and President Clinton orders in troops. **********On Tuesday the Kosovo Albanians agreed to take part in the talks while the United States and its NATO allies continued to pressure Serbia. Already NATO has threatened to use air strikes against Serbia if it refuses to enter the talks or if it does not accept an agreement by Feb. 19. **********Officials said the President must see any final agreement. He is then is expected to consult Congress again before he would send ground troops. **********Administration officials emphasized today how Europe is taking the larger role in the proposed Kosovo settlement. **********''Whatever contribution we make to NATO in this regard should be relatively small by comparison because we have been carrying a very large load as far as the Air Force components,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''And should there be any air strikes ordered, we would be the ones carrying the load on that.'' **********Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, said that instead of having an American lead the peacekeeping force, he would recommend that a British officer head it.

Even so, the team is well aware that money is neither black nor white, but green. **********''While African-Americans are the target audience, the fund will go after all investors,'' said Mr. Eley, chief executive of the Edgar Lomax Company, a Springfield, Va., firm with $1 billion in assets under management, including a fund, Edgar Lomax Value. ''A fund cannot grow with just one population.'' **********The firm's fund gained 10.84 percent last year, ranking in the 59th percentile among large value funds, according to Morningstar. The new Liberty fund is not yet tracked. **********SOME seasoned Wall Street professionals question the financial sense of small funds' aiming at black investors without a niche that is stronger than race. Harold E. Doley Jr., owner of Doley Securities and the first African-American to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, more than 25 years ago, said: ''To merely have a black-owned fund doing what everyone else does in a crowded arena is not necessary. To market as a socially conscious fund is promising, because there are still needs for good socially conscious funds.'' **********Nathan A. Chapman, chief executive of Chapman Capital Management Holdings in Baltimore, says filling such a niche is secondary to creating a profitable fund. Last fall he founded the DEM Equity Mutual fund. The initials stand for domestic emerging markets -- the fund invests in publicly traded companies owned or led by blacks, Asian-Americans, Latinos and women. Morningstar does not yet track the fund. **********When it comes to marketing the fund, ''We are interested in everyone,'' he said. **********Still, given the underrepresentation of blacks among the nation's investors, many of the new black portfolio managers are eager to win them over. Fifty-seven percent of black households with incomes of $50,000 or more a year invest in stocks or mutual funds, compared with 81 percent of their white counterparts, according to a study last year by Yankelovich Partners for Charles Schwab, the big discount brokerage house, and Ariel. **********''It is a classic business case,'' says Duane Davis, president of the Coalition of Black Investors, based in Winston-Salem, N.C. ''It's a huge $5 billion market right in your face.'' **********Though the number of black-advised mutual funds has grown, the involvement of blacks in that arena is still low relative to their population, said John W. Rogers Jr., founder and chief executive of Ariel. **********Because African-Americans seldom had large family fortunes, Mr. Rogers said, ''we never had to learn a lot about the investment advisory and mutual fund business, and those folks who run those companies didn't have to learn much about us.'' **********But judging by the standing-room-only attendance at seminars for black investors, that may be changing. Some 1,100 people attended one such seminar, held in October at Hunter College in New York and sponsored by the New York State Comptroller's office and Network Journal, a business publication. **********American Express, as part of a 10-year campaign to triple its share of the financial planning market, has waged one of the most aggressive drives to attract black investors. In New York alone, the company has 80 financial planners recruiting black clients, and it is holding a series of seminars and large dinner parties in African-American communities. **********Tony Chapelle, editor of Securities Pro, a newsletter covering blacks in the securities industry, said, ''There are a growing number of black folks who want to invest with black folks, which the Ariel study showed.'' **********ALL of this, however, does not necessarily give black-advised mutual funds an edge. Brokers recommend funds from their firms' list of approved choices, which are based on such factors as longevity, performance and fees. With nearly all black-advised funds small and most relatively new, few have appeared on those lists. Ariel has made the most headway, and is included in the fund supermarkets of Charles Schwab, Jack White and Fidelity Investments. **********Liberty is waging a campaign for inclusion, but, Mr. McDonald said, ''we are not depending on being listed with those funds.'' Rather, the Liberty Freedom fund has ''gone directly to our market niche,'' he said, with representatives ''at every major African-American national convention this year -- the black lawyers, doctors, bankers, mayors, fraternities, sororities; you name it, we were there.'' **********Liberty's grass-roots marketing strategy is common to black-advised mutual funds. Eugene Profit, who started Profit Value, a top-ranked  large-cap fund based in Silver Spring, Md., two years ago, says he tries to attract investors primarily through seminars and booths at major conventions. The fund returned 31.67 percent, placing in the first percentile of large value funds, according to Morningstar. **********''I think of myself like Charlie Merrill some 80 years ago, who brought investing to the common man door to door,'' Mr. Profit said.  ''We really get the bulk of our assets through word of mouth and door-to-door pounding.'' Those assets now total $2.6 million. **********And regardless of race, Mr. Profit said, once the investor is in the fold, ''at the end of the day, they want to know the same thing that everyone else wants to know: 'How did you do?'

One member of the group, a seasoned real estate agent, negotiated new leases for the project. Another member took a jumble of outdated computers, added some newer machines bought with donations and wired together an up-to-the-minute network. **********Practicing what they call ''venture philanthropy,'' new groups of donors like these have set about applying to charities the skills they apply to their companies. They are also pressing nonprofit organizations to become more efficient and businesslike. **********''It has to do with a generational shift,'' said Paul Brainerd, who founded Social Venture Partners after he collected $150 million from the sale of his software company, the Aldus Corporation, to the Adobe Corporation in 1994. ''These are people in their 30's and 40's who have more to give than just their money. They have their intellects, their minds. Their idea is more than just charity. It's investing.'' **********Social Venture Partners has 135 members drawn from a rising generation of philanthropists known around Seattle as the Baby Bills, in emulation of William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman. Individuals or couples who are members donate at least $5,000 a year each. Last year, about 50 members donated a total of about $300,000. This year, in all, the group plans to give away almost $1 million -- an indication that the effort is growing as rapidly as some of the members' companies. Board members include William H. Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, and Scott Oki, a former Microsoft executive who is now a venture capitalist and philanthropist. **********Mr. Gates himself, in giving $200 million to send the Internet into the nation's libraries, likewise provides more than machines and software. As Patricia Q. Stonesifer, a former Microsoft executive who serves as chairman and president of the Gates Library Foundation, said, ''I've now got 100 trainers and technical support people out in Louisiana and Mississippi making sure that the technology isn't just deployed but becomes a part of the librarians' knowledge and skills.'' **********Mr. Gates and his wife, Melinda, announced plans last month to donate $100 million for speeding the delivery of childhood vaccines to developing nations. There, the follow-up will include helping governments and private health agencies improve their own distribution of vaccines. That effort came together over dinner at the Gateses' home with more than a dozen experts in world health. **********Like Mr. Gates, the new philanthropists often seek to answer challenges from those who say their products are widening inequality, leaving behind those without computer access or encouragement. To interest high school girls in exploring careers in computer science, Katrina Garnett, founder and president of Crossworlds Software in Burlingame, Calif., has committed $1 million to the Backyard Project. It includes a Web site, www.backyard.org, brochures advising girls to study science and technology, and an annual computer camp where girls learn the C programming language -- and networking skills that don't necessarily involve electronics."

Lasmo and Shell will now collect seismic data detailing underground rock structures, the first step in determining whether drilling for deposits of oil is warranted. Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil producing nation. **********''We are only in the third week of our new life after the merger of BP and Amoco, and we would prefer to take a little more time to assess our interest in the region,'' a spokesman for BP said. ''That most definitely does not mean we are not interested in Iran.'' **********Azerbaijan warned Shell and Lasmo last month not to go forward with their plans, which call for exploration of the southern portion of the Caspian Sea. Iran, Azerbaijan and the other nations bordering the Caspian have been arguing since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 over just how to carve up the oil resources of the region, which analysts say contains at least as much oil as the North Sea. **********BP said it would not work in any ''area of dispute'' until there was some agreement. **********The venture company opened an office in Teheran last year to evaluate work in Iran, though it has proceeded more slowly than some European rivals, like Total S.A., because United States economic sanctions bar investment in Iran."

He was 92. **********His family and the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, announcing the death, did not say where it had occurred. **********Mr. Couve de Murville served de Gaulle for 10 years as foreign minister, before becoming first his finance minister and then, after the 1968 student revolt against de Gaulle, prime minister. He served about a year in that post. **********France's current foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, lauded Mr. Couve de Murville today as ''a great ambassador'' for his country. **********An impeccable diplomat, Mr. Couve de Murville was born on Jan. 24, 1907, in Rheims, the son of a judge and scion of a well-known family of France's Protestant minority. He glided through his country's most elite schools, earning a doctorate in law and a degree in literature from the Sorbonne and graduating No. 1 from the Ecole des Sciences Politiques, from which France has traditionally drawn its senior civil servants. He joined the Finance Ministry at the young age of 23, and within 10 years had risen to one of its most senior posts. **********During World War II, Mr. Couve de Murville at first stayed in France, serving the Vichy government that collaborated with the occupying Nazis. But in 1943, he fled to Algiers to serve the Free French administration that eventually came under de Gaulle. **********After the war, Mr. Couve de Murville served as ambassador to Italy, Egypt, the United States and West Germany. An ardent golfer, he was reportedly on the links in 1958 when the newly elected President de Gaulle made contact with him and asked to be foreign minister. **********Mr. Couve de Murville went on to outdo Talleyrand by serving a decade as foreign minister, becoming known as ''Monsieur Cool'' for his unruffled aplomb. Like his master,  de Gaulle, whom he served loyally, he had a world view that was firmly centered on France. **********During the 1960's, this insistence on the identity and concerns of France sometimes set the government in Paris apart from Washington. While Mr. Couve de Murville, who spoke near-perfect English, was a strong proponent of making no concessions to the Soviet Union, his government also raised American eyebrows by drawing closer to China. **********Asked about those policies in an interview in U.S. News and World Report in March 1964, he analyzed the reasons for differences with America. ''It may happen -- and in fact it has happened -- that our policy is not along the same lines as the policy of the United States,'' he said. ''It's not because we want it to to be different. It is because our thinking is different.'' **********He added, for emphasis: ''It may happen that our interests are not the same as yours, because we are here, and you are on the other side of the Atlantic.'' **********Two years later, France pulled out of NATO's integrated military command. It has never rejoined. **********The May 1968 riots that rattled the Gaullist government saw Mr. Couve de Murville transferred from the foreign to the finance ministry, and then to the prime minister's office. When de Gaulle resigned as president in 1969 after losing a referendum on reform of the political system, Mr. Couve de Murville stayed on as caretaker until another former prime minister, Georges Pompidou, was elected president in June. **********In 1973, Mr. Couve de Murville was elected to the Senate, the upper house of Parliament, a seat he held until 1995. **********He married Jacqueline Schweisguth, an amateur painter, in 1932. They had three daughters, and several grandchildren."

It features a campy all-male chorus singing carols in matched cardigans on a set strongly reminiscent of the TV show ''Sing Along With Mitch.'' **********Dayton Hudson's Target stores has been running a campaign that uses its bull's-eye logo as a sort of  optical illusion in commercials set to the song, ''A Sign of The Times'' sung by Petula Clark. **********And, the Old Navy unit of Gap Inc. has a longtime kitschy campaign with a bit of a 60's production feel, featuring its spokeswoman Carrie Donovan, known in TV spots for her big round eyeglasses and 60's-style fashion exclamations. **********And there are other less obvious examples: Gap's Banana Republic unit features a ''togetherness'' campaign with a bit of a 60's feel and some 60's-style film footage. Volkswagen's New Beetle campaign is also reminiscent of happy 60's advertising -- not to mention the popular car of the decade. **********''My sense is we live in this brave, new ever-accelerating frenetic world, dominated by more and more products, massive choices and all these dot-coms screaming at you, and it's all bewildering to people,'' said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant based in Greenwich, Conn. ''It's overtaxing people's minds, and there's this great wish to go back to a time when it was simpler.'' **********It is also a fashion trend. Advertising is simply picking up what is already circulating in the culture, and that includes things like 1960's fashions and hairstyles, retro 60's furnishings and the popularity of the film character Austin Powers. **********Like the fashion trend itself, the advertising that capitalizes on the 60's does so in a light-hearted way. **********Bill Oberlander, executive creative director of Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, an agency in New York, sees some parallels between 1999 and the 1960's, with both having great faith in progress and a strong economy. **********''I consider the 90's to be much like the Camelot years; there's this feeling of stability, of good times, of America at its best,'' he said. ''People are very optimistic right now, once we get past this Y2K blip.'' **********The Amazon campaign is intended to convey that Amazon is the place to shop online for everything from toys to gifts. Created by the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, the spot is aimed at a broad audience, including many new online users, while still winking at the trendy young techies who embraced the site from the beginning. **********Amazon felt that while some eras, like the bebop 1950's or disco 1970's, had been overused, the 1960's had barely been tapped. **********''Older viewers connect with it instantly. They say it reminds them of watching the old variety shows like Lawrence Welk or Andy Williams, while younger adults just see it as fun and catchy and different,'' said Paul Capelli, a spokesman for Amazon. **********Amazon also liked the low-tech feel of the spots juxtaposed against what is viewed as a high-tech product, he said. The commercials even carry the lyrics in a ribbon at the bottom of the screen. **********Peterson Milla Hooks, a creative boutique in Minneapolis, came up with Target's ''A Sign of The Times'' campaign, said John Pellegrene, Target's executive vice president for marketing. Mr. Pellegrene had used Ms. Clark and her hit song in the 1960's when he worked for B. F. Goodrich. **********''Back then we used it because it was the hit of the day and she was a big star,'' Mr. Pellegrene said. ''This time, it's a fashion trend.'' **********He noted that while the spot borrows from the 60's, it is updated with contemporary colors and styles that distinguish it from what you would see in 1964. Even the song was rearranged for the commercials. **********A pitfall in latching onto advertising trends is that a campaign may not have a purpose beyond being fashionable, Mr. Trout said. Target's campaign, he said, works because it drives home the company's core message that its stores offer ''mass with class.'' But he said it was not clear that Amazon's campaign clearly put across the message that it sells more than books. **********''It's a visual distraction,'' he said, ''and the problem with a visual distraction is that you stop listening. You don't hear the message, you just hear them singing this dumb song, and you're not telling me why you are better than the other cat.'' **********In any case, the campaigns are likely to be as fleeting as any other style. Mr. Capelli said Amazon's campaign would run just through the holidays. Target will update its campaign for spring, but Mr. Pellegrene wasn't ready to say exactly how it would change."

But Europe's acknowledged lead in mobile telephones will bring American Internet access up short, he said in a keynote speech. **********Europe and Asia have trailed the United States ever since the Internet was developed 30 years ago from a Pentagon computer network. About half of the 160 million Internet users are in the United States. While many analysts agree that the growth will be huge and the gap with the United States narrower in the next few years, they do not go as far as Mr. Ellison in giving the edge to Europe. **********New technology and agreement on standards are about to allow faster-based Internet connections over cellular phones, and that is where Europe will pull ahead, Mr. Ellison said. By the end of this year, telephone-service providers will start offering the first Internet-based interactive products using a technology called WAP, for wireless applications protocol. **********Using WAP-enabled telephones, which rival manufacturers Ericsson AB of Sweden and Nokia Oy of Finland say they will be selling within a few weeks, subscribers will be able to send and receive electronic mail, shop and do their banking on their mobiles. The phones will be using what are essentially boiled-down World Wide Web browsers to connect with specially written software stored on the Internet. More than 200 companies are supporting the standard, which was approved this year by the International Telecommunication Union, a global standards body. **********Earlier in the week at Telecom 99, the Nokia chairman, Jorma Ollila, predicted that 600 million of the 1 billion cell phones in use by 2004 would be WAP-capable. And Yoshio Utsumi, secretary-general of the ITU, which arranges the trade show, offered in his opening speech that by 2003 ""the marriage of Internet and mobile services should be complete."" **********""This new generation of wireless Internet device will allow more Europeans to have access to the Internet than Americans,"" Mr. Ellison said. Even now, Europe has what Mr. Ellison said was a two-year lead in digital wireless telephony. Of 300 million cell phone subscribers, about a third are in Europe. **********""You are the world leaders in this โ you are the center โ and then Asia, and then North America dead last,"" he said. ""Your service has better technology at lower cost than the United States. It's standards-based."" **********While Europe and parts of Asia follow a single standard of cellular telephony, the North American market is still splintered among analog and two or three digital standards. That makes ""roaming,"" or using a mobile phone outside a subscriber's home region, difficult at best. **********Separately, in his keynote speech, Microsoft Corp.'s chairman, Bill Gates, conceded that Microsoft's original vision of a PC ""on every home, on every desk"" had been updated to having Internet access ""anytime, any place, on any device."" But he said that did not diminish Microsoft's role as the biggest seller of software. **********""Our role as a software provider is to take this idea of the PC, where people are building digital documents, and extend that,"" he said. ""We can take all of that and extend it across all these different devices."" **********For the Internet and telecommunications markets, Microsoft makes server software and the Windows operating system. But it also is allying itself with phone companies and service providers to create new ways of reaching computer users and packaging software. ""Today I would say that our work with telecommunications companies is if anything equally important"" to the kind of partnerships Microsoft forged with Intel Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. in its early years, he said. **********""The PC continues to surprise the analysts,"" Mr. Gates said. ""The PC is not to be underestimated. The volume today is well over 100 million units a year. And that's driven us all in the software industry to create some very, very exciting things around that."""

The company is expected to price its shares as soon as tomorrow, at $31 to $35 apiece. That would give the company, which has about $57 billion under management, a value of $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion. **********Expectations had been much higher two months ago, when Neuberger's 70 partners voted to go public. But since then, the investment management industry has been buffeted by fears that its growth may be slowing and concerns that higher interest rates will hurt financial stocks in general. Big publicly traded fund companies, including T. Rowe Price and Franklin Resources, lost a quarter of their value in the third quarter. **********Last week, Blackrock Inc., the money management unit of the PNC Bank Corporation, went public at the very low end of expectations, $14 a share, even as some analysts cited the firm's better-than-average growth prospects. Even more humbling, Gabelli Asset Management, which the fund manager Mario J. Gabelli took public in February at $17.50 a share, announced its second stock buyback last week in hopes of helping shore up its lagging shares. The shares closed yesterday at $14.875. **********''Pricing has become depressed of late,'' said Neal Epstein, vice president at Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola & Thornton. ''The multiples have definitely retreated.'' His firm's index of mainstream asset managers trades at slightly more than 15 times this year's earnings, a 50 percent discount to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********At $33, the midpoint of its expected range, Neuberger would trade at 12.5 times 1999 estimated earnings, and 11.2 times those for next year. **********Neuberger tried to go public last year but pulled back in October, after the stock market clobbered shares of asset managers on news of Russia's crisis and the near-collapse of a giant hedge fund. **********Several other financial-services concerns then went public, most notably Neuberger's underwriter, Goldman, Sachs, which sold shares in its initial public offering in May. But Neuberger waited until late this summer to take the plunge again, just as shares of asset managers began to slump once more -- in part because of fears that the fund industry's growth rate has slowed permanently. **********Aside from the soft market, Neuberger's biggest problem is its sagging mutual fund business, which has suffered an outflow of more than $3 billion the last two years from its value-oriented funds, now down to $36.3 billion in assets. **********So Neuberger executives are emphasizing a brighter spot: The firm's private asset management business, which tends money for wealthy individuals. It generated $90.5 million, or 58 percent, of the partnership's net income before principal compensation during the first six months of the year. The fund and institutional business contributed $56.1 million in earnings and the securities business $10.2 million more. These figures will be considerably reduced by the company's conversion to a public company. **********Speaking to stock analysts and fund managers on Monday, Neuberger's chief executive, Jeffrey B. Lane, said that if its business of managing portfolios for the wealthy was valued along the lines of the U.S. Trust Corporation, which trades at about 22 times this year's earnings, it alone would be worth close to $33 a share. **********In other words, Mr. Lane suggested that investors would be getting the mutual fund and securities businesses ''almost for free,'' said Amy Butte of Bear Stearns, who attended the presentation. **********''They're losing assets like everybody else in the mutual fund industry, but I think generally that high net worth is where people want to be,'' said Pat Ouimet, a portfolio manager at the John Hancock Financial Industries fund in Boston. The private business, Ms. Ouimet noted, is less prone to sudden swings in assets than mutual funds. **********Geoff Bobroff, a fund consultant in East Greenwich, R.I., says there is an unusually big gap between what many fund companies are trading for and what they would fetch in a takeover. A firm like Neuberger, he said, would be worth 16 to 17 times earnings in an acquisition. ''I'm not sure I understand why the marketplace seems not to be recognizing these private sales,'' he said."

Most are Jews who were trapped in Europe during World War II or captured American soldiers, some of them also Jewish. The settlement would not apply to the vast majority of Americans held in regular prisoner of war camps. **********The agreement was the result of a second round of negotiations between the State Department and the German Government over the issue. The earlier talks ended with a settlement in 1995 that required Germany to provide about $2 million to 11 Americans who had been identified as former prisoners in Nazi concentration camps. At the time, the two countries agreed that the United States would search for others who were American citizens when they were imprisoned in the camps and who might also be entitled to German restitution. American officials, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said the search turned up about 240 more claimants. **********The agreement does not apply to camp survivors who became American citizens after the war, but many of them were entitled to compensation under other agreements with the German Government. **********Steven Perles, a Washington lawyer who represents about 20 of the claimants, said his clients and their families were ''generally pleased'' with the agreement, which was first reported by USA Today. ''Generally the State Department has done a good job here.'' **********But he said he was concerned by reports that it could take another six months for his clients to receive their compensation checks. ''Most of these claimants are well into their 80's, and as you can imagine, any further delay is an extraordinary hardship for them and their families,'' he said. ''None of these people have been told whether they are going to receive funds and in what amount.'' **********In a statement today, the German Government said that under the agreement, ''it is up to the discretion of the U.S. Government to distribute the funds provided for under the global agreement as well as to determine who, on an individual basis, is entitled to receive them.'' Germany, it said, ''sees this agreement as a sign of good will and humanity.'' **********The German Parliament must still approve the settlement. American officials said that the lawmakers were almost certain to approve the pact, and that the vote was expected within a few months. **********The German Government and corporations have been under growing pressure to settle compensation claims by victims of the Nazis. **********Spurred by Germany's new Social Democratic Government and several large trans-Atlantic mergers, large German banks and industrial conglomerates have struggled to devise a plan to compensate Holocaust survivors and Poles, Russians and other Europeans enslaved by the Nazis. Businesses, from Deutsche Bank to Siemens and DaimlerChrysler, are trying to free themselves from a flood of American class action suits alleging that they profited by collaborating with the Nazis."

On the other, the United States is scorned as the helpless superpower that has tried over the years to destroy the Islamic Republic but has failed miserably. **********Then there is a third view, espoused by the reformist newspapers that back President Mohammad Khatami, that Iran can no longer play the role of victim and has to solve its own problems. **********''Why do we accuse the foreign enemy, instead of acknowledging the truth and finding our own weakness?'' an editorial in the newspaper Khordad asked about the violent street demonstrations of the last week. ''Do we have a foreign enemy that is so strong that it managed to penetrate and riot even in the most central streets of Teheran?'' **********But that was not the view expressed at Teheran University, the country's biggest official platform. There, the Government sent Hassan Taheri Khoramabadi, the most junior of the four rotating speakers at Friday Prayers, to address the tens of thousands of worshipers. **********American meddling was part of a plot to destroy Iran's economy, the cleric said. ''America wants to prove to the European and our neighboring countries and the Middle Eastern countries that there is no stability in Iran, that there's anarchy here,'' he said. ''That way the others would not have relations and do business with Iran.'' **********''Death to America!'' the crowd chanted. **********Mr. Khoramabadi said nothing less than the demise of the revolution was the goal of the American-backed protesters. ''It is the revolution that they have taken aim at,'' he warned. **********''Death to America!'' the crowd chanted again. **********He asked the country's top leaders to define ''a red line for the revolution'' that no one would be allowed to cross. ''Differences in a family can be tolerated, but there have to be unbreakable limits,'' he said. **********''Death to America!'' the crowd chanted again. **********So it went all through the sermon. **********Fourteen months ago at the same pavilion on the first anniversary of his election, Mr. Khatami had a different message, a call to end the clergy's tight hold on power. He silenced a group of students when they uttered the familiar, ''Death to America!'' **********''I prefer to talk about life, not death,'' he said, to cheering and clapping, considered an un-Islamic and Western affectation. **********But the strategy did not work. **********''The regime is like a shop that is selling this slogan,'' said a political science professor at Teheran University who a few days ago was willing to speak on the record but is no longer. ''If they lose this slogan, they have nothing left to sell.'' **********On the docudrama this afternoon, one of the most popular viewing times of the week, a different sort of anti-Americanism was on display, ''Sandstorm,'' an officially produced film about the failed military raid by the United States to free American hostages in April 1980. **********The use of television footage from the crisis lent an authenticity to the film. It showed Mr. Carter in his signature cardigan sweater in the Oval Office, consulting with Vice President Walter F. Mondale and other top aides; Mr. Donaldson, with long sideburns, reporting the seizure of the American Embassy on ABC News on Nov. 4, 1979, and an English-speaking hostage taker who interviewed blacks and women among the hostages. The hostages were released ''on humanitarian grounds.'' **********The rescue mission was a horrific combination of bad luck and poor planning. The plan was to raid the embassy from a staging area deep in the Iranian desert. The mission was halted after three of the eight helicopters involved had been put out of action by technical problems. In the evacuation, a helicopter collided with a C-130 transport plane. Eight Americans died. The evacuating Americans left behind a battlefield scene of burned and abandoned equipment, and their comrades' bodies. **********The 90-minute film portrays the Americans as ruthless, obscenity-spouting veterans of Vietnam eager to free the hostages -- and perhaps restore the monarchy in the process. **********''By tomorrow, we will have Iran in our hands,'' the commander said in the film. **********''Tell me, old soldier, do you mean we're going to have a military coup?'' asked the pilot. **********''Did you think we're going with no plan and no invitation into the heart of the enemy?'' the commander replied. **********Much of the film was accurate. It portrayed a team of American spies' posing as journalists as they watched the embassy from a hotel across the street. **********But like any docudrama, distortions abounded. The main Persian-speaking spy was a Zionist, who wears a yarmulke. When an American commando tried to pray, his commander did not let him finish. **********The end of the film showed actual film of the rescuers' crash site and the eight bodies. **********''Who stopped Carter's helicopters?'' a male voice asked at the film's end, a quote from the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of Iran's revolution. ''We stopped it. The sands stopped it. They were God's messenger.'' **********In the reformist newspapers, a different sort of ''dialogue'' is being conducted. **********The crackdown against the protesters and the pledge by the authorities to use all necessary means to prevent more trouble may have stilled the students, at least for the moment. But the move has emboldened commentators in several newspapers, who are writing in ways that they would not have dared even a few weeks ago. **********The newspapers have become a voice of the country's conscience, demanding that Iran look for the reasons behind the unrest at home, not abroad. **********One argument is that years of restrictions have led youths to rebel. **********''When our kids are at school, they only hear things like, 'Do not do this, do not do that,' '' Shahla Ezazi, a sociologist, wrote on Thursday in Neshat. ''Instead of learning to become independent citizens capable of living in society, they react this way.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/03/business/personal-business-lending-his-name-and-tools-to-charity.html,Roy Furchgott,1999-10-03,"Article on stand-up comedian Tim Allen, star of TV show Home Improvement, who, following philanthropic example set by Paul Newman in food industry, is lending his name to tools; Allen's entity, Tim Allen and Laura Diebel Foundation, has lost money...",1067,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"Lending His Name, and Tools, to Charity","PERSONAL BUSINESS; Lending His Name, and Tools, to Charity"," **********TIM ALLEN may be best known as a stand-up comedian, the star of the television show ''Home Improvement'' and the voice of the hero Buzz Lightyear in the animated film ''Toy Story.'' But he hopes to become as trusted and honored a name in tools as Paul Newman is in food -- with similar benefits for charity. **********But Mr. Allen and others delving into nonprofit businesses are finding that it isn't as easy as Mr. Newman and his brand, Newman's Own, make it look. **********Mr. Allen's vision was to cash in on his fixated-with-tools comic persona by making high-quality hammers, drills and other tools, and giving the profits to the Tim Allen and Laura Diebel Foundation. (Ms. Diebel is his wife.) The foundation donates to a variety of causes, including the Target House in Memphis, which accommodates families whose children are being treated at a nearby hospital for life-threatening illnesses. But during the first few years, Mr. Allen said, the company has lost money, though he would not specify how much. **********''The company cost us a mint to get going,'' he said, adding for comic effect, ''It couldn't be something that is simple like -- pardon me, Paul Newman -- salad dressing.'' Mr. Allen has gone into his own pocket to make sure the company could make some charitable donations each year. **********Mr. Allen, like others, is finding that it is easier to raise money for charity than to earn money for charity. Yet the most exciting trend in the charity world is to establish businesses that generate a predictable income stream. ''That's where the sizzle is,'' said James E. Thalhuber, president and chief executive of the National Center for Social Entrepreneurs, in Minneapolis, which advises nonprofit groups -- some linked to celebrities, some not -- that are planning to establish businesses. **********Part of the sizzle is the glamour that giving-minded celebrities have brought to these ventures -- like Robert Redford's Sundance Institute, in Utah, which backs film makers but is supported by a resort, a film festival and a catalogue of pricey cowboy-style merchandise. Or Don Imus's Imus Ranch, which is being built near Santa Fe, N.M., and is intended as a retreat for children with cancer. The ranch may be supported in part by Imus products that he pitches on the radio and that reportedly take in $10 million a year. **********A spate of celebrities are lending their fame to products with charity ties. In cereals alone, the quarterback Doug Flutie has Flutie Flakes, while baseball's Cal Ripken has Cal's Classic O's. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has helped to introduce Keeper Springs' Mountain Spring water, with the proceeds intended to protect waterways. **********Most groups that come to Mr. Thalhuber aren't prepared to make the leap from fund-raising to sales. Mr. Thalhuber's organization has developed a risk-assessment kit to help charities decide if they are ready for business. ''We will ask them, how much do they understand market forces, their understanding of the competition. Do they have strategic planning and financial processes? What is driving them? Is this the right timing? Are they willing to act?'' **********Mr. Allen says he is prepared to hone his business skills as he goes. **********Several years ago, through a friend, the race car driver Michael Andretti, who drives for the Newman/Haas race team, Mr. Allen arranged for an introduction to executives at Newman's Own. **********''The best I could do was to get information about how to avoid pitfalls,'' he said, ''and that you have to fail a bit to succeed.'' **********Newman's Own, which gives all its aftertax profits to charity, has certainly claimed success. It projects sales of $100 million of food products like salad dressings, popcorn and lemonade in 1999, and said it had given $100 million to charity since 1982. **********At first, Mr. Allen included the kind of pricey features that professionals appreciate but homeowners don't notice. ''People didn't care that I used a high-density plastic, and better-feeling switches, and better ball bearings, and an all-metal chuck,'' he said.  His current drill, at about $40, is comparable in price and quality to its direct competitors, he said. It still features touches like a built-in bubble level to let homeowners know if the hole they are drilling is straight. His tools -- hammers, drills, knives, screwdrivers and tool kits -- are mostly made by the Japanese company Ryobi Ltd. **********While celebrities bring attention to any business, that visibility can have pitfalls. A marketing misstep can hurt a celebrity's primary profession. ''In my career it's not advisable to be doing infomercials,'' Mr. Allen said. **********Celebrities worry that their charitable efforts may be seen as career-boosting publicity stunts. The talent agency Creative Artists has established a foundation to give its artists and corporate clients an avenue into charity work, mostly through volunteering their skills or fame, yet the group's efforts have been behind the scenes. The reason, said Morgan Binswanger, who runs the foundation, is ''to avoid the cynicism that is always out there.'' **********And David Reibstein, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, noted that celebrity sponsorship ''is usually done by less than superstars, and it could taint them a bit.'' **********''They can be seen as an endorser,'' he added, ''and that's what you do when you are hungry.'' **********The fear of being perceived as publicity hounds creates a difficult marketing proposition, as charitable companies try to save advertising expenses by courting news coverage without seeming self-serving. An executive from Newman's Own agreed to provide some information on the condition that no quotation would come from the company itself. Neither Mr. Imus's group nor Mr. Redford's responded to phone calls about their charitable businesses. **********An executive at Newman's Own said the company consulted regularly with celebrities interested in following Mr. Newman's lead. But why take such a difficult route to charitable giving? **********Jed Emerson, executive director of the Roberts Enterprise Development Fund, which finances socially responsible businesses, said the new popularity of these kinds of enterprises is driven by executives  who are trying to fill the gap left by eroding government social services. Moreover, he said, building these do-gooder companies is a creative challenge that, if successful, can massage the ego. **********''I wonder if it is a way for celebrities to be taken more seriously,'' he mused. ''Maybe it's the same drive that sends celebrities into politics.'' **********It's none of the above, Mr. Allen said. ''Mostly I like challenges,'' he said, ''and it's a challenge to do a new business that everybody benefits from.''"

X. Sillerman and whose Pace Theatrical Group has already helped produce some Broadway shows like the current musical ''The Civil War,'' is offering cash and equity worth $100 million to $110 million for most of Livent's assets, the person said. **********Any deal must be approved by the Federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The company's creditors, which are owed about $200 million, would have a chance to object to the deal. **********Livent filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors in November after its new managers, who include Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood talent agent, said they had discovered tens of millions of dollars in fraud. **********A spokesman for Livent said that the company had no comment about the negotiations. Mr. Sillerman was not available last night to comment, his assistant said. **********If approved, the deal would mean that the curtain would continue to rise on Livent's current musicals like ''Ragtime'' and ''Fosse.'' **********Under the deal, SFX would buy most of Livent's assets, including the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at Times Square and two other theaters in Chicago and Toronto. SFX would also buy rights to Livent's productions, which, besides ''Ragtime'' and ''Fosse,'' include a production of ''Phantom of the Opera'' in Toronto. **********SFX would also get rights to the company's plans for new shows like a production of ''The Sweet Smell of Success.'' The deal would bolster the live-theater business of SFX, which has been on a buying spree of entertainment companies, especially those in the rock and pop concert business. Over the last two years, Mr. Sillerman has snapped up at least a dozen of the nation's largest regional music promoters. He has also bought amphitheaters, ticketing companies and artist management agencies. **********SFX also bought the Pace Entertainment Corporation, the top producer of touring theatrical shows and a presenter of auto races and music. Pace has already entered into at least one agreement with Livent, in which it is touring the country with a production of ''Ragtime.'' **********In 1997, Mr. Sillerman made millions of dollars when he sold SFX Broadcasting, which he had formed from a group of small radio stations across the country. **********Livent has been accepting bids from possible suitors for months. Other companies that have been said to be interested include the Cablevision Systems Corporation, the Walt Disney Company and Back Row Productions Inc., a company owned by Peter Holmes a Court. **********The company has attributed its financial problems to Livent's founders, Garth H. Drabinsky, the Canadian impresario, and his partner, Myron I. Gottlieb. **********Mr. Ovitz took over the company from the two men in June 1998. Six months later, the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection. Mr. Ovitz and his new management team blamed Mr. Drabinsky and Mr. Gottlieb, saying the two executives had directed an accounting scheme under which the company recorded more than $60 million in false profits. **********Federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed criminal charges against the two men in January, but they have not turned themselves in and instead remain in Canada. They both say they have done nothing wrong."

What's a World to Do?,It's a Global Mess. What's a World to Do?," **********THE International Monetary Fund is often described these days as the rapid-response team for global financial crises, monitoring the financial health of 182 nations and flying teams of economists off to nurse stricken countries back to health before contagion spreads. **********Just don't try calling the doctors on a weekend. **********Four blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the fund's headquarters, the White House Situation Room hums 24 hours a day. So do the State Department's Operations Center and the Treasury's lesser-known Watch Office. **********But 20 months into a worldwide financial crisis that churns round the clock, the I.M.F. still closes down on nights and weekends. Last year, one senior official of the fund recalled, ''we had a desperate-sounding finance minister call in,'' seeking advice on a currency devaluation that might have shaken markets around the world. He reportedly had a pleasant chat with the security guard. **********The story is worth remembering amid the grand political pronouncements -- here, in Europe and in Asia -- about the need to build a ''new global financial architecture.'' The rhetoric has its appeal: Most everyone agrees that the system for governing the world economy that emerged from a hotel ballroom in Bretton Woods, N.H., a half-century ago -- in the era of the gold standard and fixed exchange rates -- is hopelessly outdated. **********But there the agreement ends. Some say that what the world financial system needs is not a new design but better wiring, in the form of greater communication among investors, regulators, governments and international oversight agencies -- if not security guards with Ph.D.'s in international economics. **********Over the last few months, a plethora of small-bore fixes have been proposed, everything from ''exit taxes'' to make investors think twice about bailing out of troubled markets to ''early warning systems'' to make them think twice about the stability of the countries where they invest. **********Then there are far grander designs -- so many, in fact, that it might be possible to build another ballroom at the old Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods out of bound reports describing what a new financial system should look like. **********In the last two months alone, the World Bank, the I.M.F. and the United Nations have all published analyses of what's gone wrong in global finance, each coming to different conclusions about responsibility for the continuing crisis. **********The Council on Foreign Relations, the private public-policy group based New York, has put together a high-powered commission to propose an overhaul of the system. Its report will jockey for shelf space with similar proposals oozing out of a dozen other prominent research centers. **********The Group of Seven industrialized nations couldn't wait for the council, so last weekend it announced the creation of a ''Financial Stability Forum'' to help bring order to the chaos. The idea is to begin to connect the wiring, providing a place for market regulators in many countries and the myriad international regulatory groups to talk about setting common standards for dealing with financial concerns. **********To keep the forum ''manageable,'' a G-7 statement explained, dozens of officials from each of the seven nations will be joined by no more than three members each from the I.M.F., the IBRD, the BIS and the OECD. Then, of course, ''the international regulatory groupings (BCBS, IOSCO, IAIS) would be represented by two members each, and the CGFS and CPSS by one each.'' **********(Readers interested in testing their knowledge of international organizations will find the acronyms decoded at the end of this article.) **********The forum's first meeting is scheduled for next month. **********What will change? The betting these days is not much. While some modest changes are already under way -- mostly tougher disclosure requirements for countries and their central banks -- a broad remaking of the system seems unlikely. President Clinton, who during the market swoon in September described the ''new architecture'' drive as a top priority of his second term, has spoken about it publicly only intermittently since December. And while the Treasury Department says long-term solutions will be the focus of the annual summit of G-7 leaders in early summer, skeptics abound. **********''Crises are endemic to our system, and sometimes they are healthy,'' Kenneth Courtis, the chief economist for Deutsche Bank's  Asian operations said recently. ''But after every one, there is always talk about rebuilding the system, until the markets get better. Then people forget about it. I suspect the same will happen this time.'' **********For now, though, here are the hottest ideas under discussion -- and the problems that plague them. **********Tsunami Alerts **********Imagine a Weather Channel for the global economy, a proposal being pushed by many European nations. If financial quakes loomed -- a devaluation in Brazil, export declines in China, more capital flight from South Africa or Indonesia -- the I.M.F. would broadcast the news. (It is already broadcasting summaries of its periodic reviews of member countries, with much of the information posted on its World Wide Web site, www.imf.org.) Sounds great: Tune in, then call your broker. **********But there's a hitch. Weather satellites can pick up an approaching storm a lot better than experts can see a financial disaster ahead. There were plenty of warnings about Thailand in 1997, for example, but almost no one predicted a calamity. **********''Nothing in my 26 years on Wall Street or my six years in government suggests that there is any predictive capability even remotely reliable enough for such a system,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said recently. **********The I.M.F. notes that it often detects signs that a crisis is brewing, only to discover later that the crisis never arrives. ''We've successfully predicted 14 of the past 6 financial crises,'' joked Stanley Fischer, the fund's No. 2 official. **********Of course, when an alarm issued by the Weather Channel turns out to be false, everyone is relieved. But an alarm from the I.M.F. could easily set off a stampede of investors -- creating exactly the kind of panic everyone is trying to avoid. **********Tollbooths on the Highway **********The experts call them ''capital controls'' -- limits, or taxes, on short-term investment money that flows in or out of small nations. **********The appeal is simple: If investors know that that their money will be tied up in Malaysia or Mozambique for some time, or that it will cost them a few percentage points to get it out early, they will think twice about rushing ''hot money'' into an economy that could be destabilized by a sudden, huge outflow of cash. **********Not surprisingly, politicians love this idea. And everyone points to Chile, which taxed short-term capital until recently, when investment dried up for all emerging markets. **********And there's the rub. As Malaysia learned when it banned trading in its currency, capital controls are a great way to regain sovereignty over an economy. But after a while, investors begin thinking about putting their money elsewhere -- in countries that don't tax capital. **********In short, the country that sets up a tollbooth can expect to see fewer and fewer cars on the highway. And that means the country could go begging for foreign investment. Or it might use the existence of the tax as an excuse not to change its economy. **********Promises, Promises **********One lesson of the last two years is that bad things can happen to good economies. **********South Korea, for example, clearly has the talent and the means to rank among the world's best economies. But when it nearly ran out of central bank reserves in 1997, investors panicked and the currency melted down. **********To avert such panics, the I.M.F. and some economists have suggested that countries could be ''prequalified'' for emergency aid, in the hope that the mere existence of a big credit line would reassure investors. It would be a little like getting one of those letters from a credit card company offering a $10,000 credit line -- just in case you come up short one month on the mortgage. **********That was essentially the deal the I.M.F. and the Treasury offered to Brazil last year, when it described a $41 billion bailout as ''precautionary.'' Unfortunately, that package failed to prevent a run on the currency, the real, illustrating one of the shortcomings of such aid. **********Brazil received the aid in return for detailed promises to tighten its belt, and fast. But once the deal was announced, the Brazilian Congress concluded that the heat was off and there was no rush about the reforms. It took investors only two months, until January, to conclude that the reforms might be vapor, at which point they fled. **********What can the I.M.F. do if a country fails to deliver on its promises? **********In an extreme case, as in Russia, it can stop lending altogether. But un-qualifying a country is essentially an invitation for the world to pull its money out, creating the crisis the aid was intended to avoid. **********Aim at That Target **********The Germans, with some support from France and Japan, want an agreement to establish ''target zones'' that would reduce the volatility of the world's three major currencies: the dollar, the euro and the yen. Under this plan, the major economies would coordinate their policies to keep their currencies within a specified trading range. **********Mr. Rubin thinks this is one of the worst ideas he has ever heard. **********Europe's enthusiasm for managing currencies is understandable. Its leaders want to make sure the United States doesn't let the value of the dollar slip in order to make American exports, which are declining sharply, more competitive against European products. **********Washington, of course, does not want a committee of the Group of Seven dictating American monetary policy. Suppose the United States economy began sinking, and the value of the dollar sank with it. The Group of Seven might mandate that the United States raise interest rates to stabilize the currency. That could worsen the economic downturn. **********Smaller economies also have a dog in this fight. Remember, Thailand got in trouble because it tied its currency, the baht, to the dollar. As the value of the dollar rose, so did the value of the baht, until it quickly became unsustainably high. And when Thailand de-linked its currency from the dollar -- well, that was the day the Asian crisis started. **********Start Bailing **********When a country begins to list, investors bail out. So beginning with the effort to save South Korea, the Treasury has talked about ''bailing in'' investors. **********What American officials mean is that big banks and other lenders should be compelled to take responsibility for having provided countries with the money they used so foolishly. For example, the lenders might be obliged to roll over their loans or turn short-term lending into long-term lending, rather than head for the exits. When South Korea was teetering, Mr. Rubin strong-armed some lenders to do just that. **********But since then, the enthusiasm for ''bailing in'' has been tempered by reality. Bankers have begun to warn that if the risk of lending to emerging markets climbs too high, either they will charge the riskiest countries the highest interest rates (to compensate for the possibility that they will one day be ''bailed in'') or they will avoid them completely. A result is that the developing world may not develop very fast. **********Swinging a Baton **********Barry Eichengreen, an international economist at the University of California at Berkeley, says the I.M.F. ''will have to become less of a fireman and more of a policeman.'' **********In a new book, ''Toward a New International Financial Architecture'' (Institute for International Economics, 1999), he explained that rather than roaring to the rescue once disaster strikes, the fund should be constantly policing compliance with international rules and regulations -- and making sure that the markets understand who is abiding by the rules and who is not. **********But that would require a change of culture at the I.M.F., which has often been beholden to its members, including the rule breakers. Fund officials would have to be willing to utter unpleasant news, in strong terms. **********And they might need to answer their phones on the weekends. **********The acronyms: IBRD International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, better known as the World Bank; BIS Bank for International Settlements; OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; BCBS Basle Committee on Banking Supervision; IOSCO International Organization of Securities Commissions; IAIS International Association of Insurance Supervisors; CGFS Committee on the Global Financial System; CPSS Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems."

Ka Dinizulu, Zulu Leader, Dies at 67"," **********Mcwayizeni Ka Dinizulu, the most senior Prince of the Zulu people of South Africa, died on Tuesday, the South African Government has announced. He was 67. **********His family said he had been sick for more than two years, The Associated Press reported. **********Mcwayizeni was a controversial figure in Zulu life. In 1990, he joined the African National Congress, which became South Africa's governing party in 1994 when South Africans voted for their first democratic Government. **********But his backing for the A.N.C. earned him the enmity of many of his fellow Zulus, and several attempts to kill him were reported over the years. Most Zulus are loyal to the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. **********For more than two decades, the Prince was a bitter opponent of Chief Buthelezi. And Inkatha and the A.N.C. have a history of bloody strife in what is now KwaZulu/Natal province in eastern South Africa, on the Indian Ocean. **********Lately the two parties' relations have improved, and the Prince was praised after his death by Deputy President Jacob Zuma, who said the Prince had played a key role in contributing to peace in KwaZulu-Natal. **********But after the new Government was formed, as Leonard Thompson, a historian of South Africa and retired Yale professor, wrote in the 1995 revised edition of his book, ''A History of South Africa'' (Yale University Press) Inkatha and the A.N.C. had some conflicting goals. **********Chief Buthelezi -- as president of Inkatha, which had become the majority party in KwaZulu/Natal, and as Minister of Home Affairs in the new Government -- ''contended for the maximum of devolution of power to the provinces within the new South Africa,'' as Professor Thompson put it, while the governing party ''showed that it was determined to whittle away the powers of the provinces.'' **********The Prince was a close supporter of the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill Zwelithini, who was his nephew. Shortly before the 1994 elections, the King, at the urging of church leaders who feared an upsurge in interparty violence during the voting, urged ''each and every Zulu'' -- partisans of both Inkatha and the A.N.C. -- to put a stop to violence. **********The Prince acted as regent before the monarch's coronation in 1971, and it is said that he wielded great influence until the dawn of the new political era in 1994. He claimed the role of senior adviser to the King and was instrumental in the omission of Chief Buthelezi from a planned group of royal advisers. **********After the watershed events of 1994, the Prince was less of a presence in the Zulus' public life. Chief Buthelezi is still his party's leader and national Minister of Home Affairs. **********When the Prince's death became known with the Government's announcement on Thursday, the Zulu royal family put off a traditional, annual fete, known as the reed dance, which had been planned for Saturday. During the celebration, girls give the monarch reeds for use in his and his cattle's quarters. **********The Prince is survived by his wife, Thoko; seven children and seven grandchildren."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/28/business/freelancers-win-appeal-in-copyright-suit.html,Felicity Barringer,1999-09-28,"US Appeals Court rules that three major publishers, including The New York Times Co, cannot include work of freelance contributors in electronic data bases without their permission; unanimous ruling overturns lower court finding that agreed with a...",1243,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Freelancers Win Appeal in Copyright Suit,Freelancers Win Appeal in Copyright Suit," **********In a decision that could reshape copyright protections for the electronic age, a Federal appeals court has ruled that three major publishers could not include the work of freelance contributors in electronic data bases without their permission. **********The unanimous ruling by the three-judge panel in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, overturned a lower court finding that had agreed with the arguments of The New York Times Company, Newsday and the Time Inc. Magazine Company and their co-plaintiffs, University Microfilms International and the Mead Data Central Corporation, the former owner of the Lexis-Nexis data bases. **********The publishers had argued that electronic data bases like Nexis were analogous to anthologies or other ''collective works'' that can be revised without the permission of the individual copyright holders. **********But the appeals panel held that ''the privilege afforded authors of collective works'' under existing law ''does not permit the publishers to license individually copyright works for inclusion in the electronic data bases.'' **********The ruling, issued Friday afternoon and concerning a lawsuit by several freelancers, comes as on-line publishing is exploding and many publications expand and rely on freelance contributors to supplement the work of their regular staff. **********It could force the companies to offer retroactive electronic-rights payments for everything from opinion pieces for Op-Ed pages to full-length magazine articles and to photographs and graphics. Alternatively, it could force the publishers to pull from their data bases any freelance work covered by the ruling. **********Recent work, however, is less likely to be subject to the ruling, since a number of media companies -- including The Times Company, Newsday, which is owned by the Times Mirror Company, and Time Warner's Time Inc. unit -- have for several years required freelance writers to sign contracts that allow electronic republication of the work without additional compensation. **********Other companies -- it is unclear how many -- have not, relying on handshake agreements or on contracts that make no mention of electronic rights. **********The impact of the decision on media companies could be ''devastating,'' said E. Leonard Rubin, a former general counsel at Playboy Enterprises who now heads the intellectual property section at the Chicago law firm of Gordon & Glickson. **********''Publications that have hastened to take advantage of the electronic age, and have an incredibly vast inventory of interesting articles and works of fiction, and wanted to post them on their Web sites and in data bases for the sake of researchers, are now going to have to go back to their data bases and make adjustments. **********''That's going to be incredibly expensive and time-consuming,'' Mr. Rubin said. **********Chief Judge Ralph K. Winter, writing for the three-judge panel that made the ruling, held that ''there is no feature peculiar to the data bases at issue in this appeal that would cause us to view them as 'revisions.' **********''Nexis is a data base comprising thousands or millions of individually retrievable articles taken from hundreds or thousands of periodicals. It can hardly be deemed a 'revision' of each edition of every periodical that it contains.'' **********While the case refers specifically to publication of material on electronic data bases, experts in copyright law said it would almost certainly apply to publication of material on Internet sites as well. **********''This is an issue of technology outpacing the law of contracts,'' said Elizabeth McNamara, a New York lawyer who specializes in copyright law. ''Arguably, each individual freelancer will be able to go to the publisher and say you've got to compensate me.'' **********Opinions on copyright law from the Second Circuit, copyright experts say, are given widespread deference around the country since so many copyright cases are litigated here in the unofficial capital of the media industry. Lawyers for the three publishers said yesterday that they were studying the decision and had not yet decided whether to appeal. **********George Freeman, an assistant general counsel for the New York Times Company, said yesterday: ''Certainly in the case of The New York Times, our complete record is a historical archive. If one takes this decision at its word it would seem to require, absent an agreement with the freelancers, that we delete articles that were part of that historical record.'' **********He added: ''This opinion's effect appears to be tampering with the historic record. That is very problematic.'' **********Jonathan Tasini, the president of the National Writers' Union and the lead plaintiff in the case, was jubilant at the panel's decision to overturn the ruling by Federal District Judge Sonia Sotomayor. **********''Every single data provider now is at risk,'' he said. ''We could go into court tomorrow if we wanted and ask to shut down every data base.'' **********In letters the writers' union sent to 22 publishers yesterday, Mr. Tasini argued that the ruling ''potentially puts your company at great financial and legal risk.'' But, the letter added, ''We want to emphasize that neither the N.W.U. nor the freelance writing community is seeking to undermine the distribution of magazine and newspaper articles via on-line networks.'' **********Instead, the letter urged widespread adoption of a licensing system that would allow publishers to obtain electronic rights to works through the Publication Rights Clearinghouse, a group that already handles licensing issues for some writers. The result, Mr. Tasini said, would be a system analogous to that operating in the music industry, in which organizations like BMI and the American Society of Composers, Arrangers and Producers license the use of music by anything from dance studios to high school musical productions. **********Officials of the American Society of Magazine Editors said yesterday they had not yet reviewed the decision and could not comment on it until they had. And lawyers for the publishers noted that the appellate court remanded the case to the district court with orders to write a final order. **********''We don't have an order yet, so we don't know the precise contours of our obligations,'' said Robin Bierstedt, the deputy general counsel at Time Inc. **********Patricia A. Felch, the lawyer for Mr. Tasini and the other writers, disagreed, saying ''the opinion is the opinion,'' and the order could not modify it, only follow it. **********In theory, the lawyers involved in the case said, the decision will give freelancers the ability to negotiate richer contracts. As Mr. Rubin noted, since the Internet knows no geography, electronic rights are tantamount to worldwide rights. ''Worldwide rights always cost more than domestic rights,'' he added. **********But in practice, Mr. Rubin and other experts said, publishers usually can set their own terms. **********''If, in fact, many writers like to think of themselves as starving, they'll capitulate to the new terms,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''Important writers won't.'' **********Still, he said that publishers might well find themselves readjusting their contract scales upward as a result of the decision. **********Most publishers started selling their archives to data bases like Lexis-Nexis or Dow Jones Interactive in the early 1980's. Lexis and Nexis were owned by Mead Data Central when the suit was filed in 1993, but in 1995 were sold to Reed Elsevier P.L.C., which paid $1.5 billion for the electronic legal and news retrieval business. **********''Way back when this first started,'' Mr. Tasini said in a phone interview yesterday, ''they should have been smart and come to writers and asked permission.

Until a few years ago, investment was a straightforward matter: Savers were content to buy Treasury bills, secure in the knowledge that they would yield more than 10 percent after tax, although the return was considerably less after taking inflation into account. **********Italy also had a generous state pension system. Workers in the highest income bracket, earning more than 150 million lire ($90,000) a year, received 45 percent of their salaries annually on retirement; those earning less received even higher percentages. **********But benefits were trimmed under reforms introduced in 1997, with earners in the top bracket hit hardest. Workers will continue to contribute 9 percent of gross pay to the state pension fund, but they will receive only 30 percent of their final salaries. **********At the same time, savers have also found they can no longer count on double-digit Treasury-bill returns. Yields have plummeted to about 3 percent, the result of reduced fiscal deficits and a convergence of European interest rates as Italy prepared for monetary union. Inflation has shrunk as well, but even after adjusting for that, returns are lower. **********The Money Report's hypothetical 40-year-old savers have new ways to invest to achieve high returns, as well as various tax advantages introduced in the 1997 reforms. They may have trouble deciding among them, however, because there is little independent financial advice in Italy, with investments typically sold through banks or through promoters tied to fund-management or insurance companies. **********One program introduced during the reforms provides tax breaks to pension savers in industries with strong trade unions, such as chemicals or metals, said Stefano Grassi, a pensions adviser at Prime Investment Management in Milan. Tax-free contributions are limited to 2 percent of taxable income up to 2.5 million lire, an amount matched by the employer. **********Under another plan, called a trattamento di fine rapporto, a compulsory employer-contribution program introduced in the 1980s, employers contribute a much higher amount โ just over 7 percent of the employee's gross salary โ but the accounts grow at just 1.5 percent a year plus 75 percent of the country's annual inflation rate. Benefits are paid as a lump sum at retirement. **********With inflation hovering around 2 percent to 3 percent, the plan offers little excitement. Mr. Grassi advises employees included in a TFR to transfer the allowable amount into one of the new industry plans. ""The performance of the industry fund will be much better than the TFR,"" he said. **********Employees who belonged to a TFR before 1996 can have their contributions reduced to 5 percent and put the remaining 2 percent into industry plans if they have them. TFR participants who joined in 1996 and after can contribute the full 7 percent, a strong enticement to younger savers. **********Stocks and bonds in Italy have performed far better in recent years than cash instruments, and a tax break introduced last year provides a further inducement to own them, said Alida Carcano, head of portfolio management at Credit Suisse Private Banking in Milan. The tax rate on capital gains was reduced to 12.5 percent from 27 percent for a variety of pooled investments, such as mutual funds, but not on individual securities. **********Further benefits are available to purchasers of funds wrapped into life-insurance policies. While taxable income and capital gains must be distributed each year by mutual funds, they are allowed to accrue tax-free in insurance products; tax is due only on redemption. **********In addition, after an investment is held for 10 years, the tax rate on capital gains falls from the usual 12.5 percent by 0.25 percentage point each year; gains on a policy sold after 20 years, say, would be taxed at 10 percent. **********""As life policies, there are a lot of fiscal benefits for the same cost and performance of an investment product,"" said Marco Rampon of Protrust, a promoter in Italy for Clerical Medical International, a British insurer. **********Giorgio Alfaras, a fund adviser with Prime, Mr. Grassi's company, said he would encourage someone with a $50,000 lump sum to take advantage of the new capital-gains tax treatment by putting most of it into funds targeting Italian or other European bonds, a reflection of the lingering conservatism of Italian investors. **********The rest of the portfolio should be put into more exciting investments, mainly European, U.S. and Asian equities, he said. When the corporate-bond market in Europe opens up, he added, high-yield bonds may become attractive alternatives to a portion of the portfolio devoted either to government bonds or equities. **********PRIME INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT'S three-to-five-year recommended portfolio: European (including Italian) bonds, 60 percent; European mid-cap equities, 20 percent, U.S. technology shares, 10 percent; Japanese and emerging Asian equities, 10 percent."

Faced with a continuing loss in audience and an explosion in technological advances, the networks are attempting to transform themselves into far more versatile institutions. **********Long considered headed for extinction, the networks are beginning to add new, interactive dimensions to their relationships with viewers and advertisers. They are seeking to develop multiple uses for their shows and sell products related to programs they broadcast. And they are preparing for the day when the functions of a TV set converge with those of a computer. **********At the center of the networks' repositioning is the ability to build and market hit entertainment shows. But the popularity of a television show is beginning to take on even more importance -- ''an outright necessity'' in the words of NBC's president, Robert C. Wright. **********For the networks, the hit show is the hub in a growing wheel of interests: promotion platforms for related businesses; sales of replays on cable television or even Internet sites and the creation of direct links between advertisers and viewers. **********In one example of the latter, Mr. Wright envisions a viewer watching a commercial for a Silverado truck, clicking on an on-screen icon and being directed to information on the vehicle, where it can be bought nearby, and perhaps even a number to call to order one. **********Networks have already moved into marketing and selling compact disks based on the music offered in a television film -- in fact, a CD from ''The 60's,'' a movie on NBC, is a hit. In coming years, they may try to sell other items, like the fashions worn by the star of a sit-com. **********None of this would be happening if television shows were viewed in the same way as films or plays are. Partly because it became the most pervasive and effective advertising medium ever created, and partly because it is plugged into the home, television has always been considered less art form than appliance. **********But even as the network industry tries to mutate from a model that relies exclusively on commercials for its income to one that also relies on electronic commerce, executives acknowledge that they must not lose their focus on their core business -- show business. **********''In the end it's still all about the content,'' said Robert A. Iger, the chairman of the ABC Group, a unit of the Walt Disney Company. **********No one is convinced that the networks can transform themselves from old media to new media. But a degree of rethinking is taking place about a previously foregone conclusion: that the networks, whose share of the audience has declined from 69 percent to 55 percent in the last five years, would die a not-all-that-slow death. Rather than contemplate death, the networks, in fact, expect advertisers to set a record of nearly $7 billion in advance purchases of commercial time for next year. **********The network prime-time sales process, not much different from the days of ''I Love Lucy,'' begins this week in elegant locations in Manhattan, from Carnegie Hall to Lincoln Center to the New Amsterdam Theater. That is where the networks will introduce their new prime-time program schedules to advertisers. **********The situation seems to defy logic: networks' ad revenues are soaring, even though their projected 8 percent rise almost identically matches the percentage decline in the size of network audiences this year. **********But competition for viewers has been multiplying on cable and on the Internet. So the power of even a diminished mass medium to reach tens of millions of people at once makes broadcast networks more valuable to advertisers, not less. **********That is just one incongruity the networks face as they try to navigate a roiling media sea they once towered over. Among the others: Networks in some ways are benefiting from the increasing competition. **********Though they cannot begin to afford to buy high-flying stars of the new media like America Online or Yahoo, the networks have become the centerpiece of the marketing and promotion strategies such companies pursue. Internet companies are buying so much commercial time that they are helping the networks set those new ad-revenue records. **********And even in instances when networks have given Internet companies commercial time in exchange for equity stakes in them, the networks wind up benefiting indirectly. By cutting the overall amount of time they have available, the networks can raise the rates on their remaining inventory. **********Still, few network executives are entirely bullish about long-term prospects. They cannot see an end to the technological advances -- from Internet expansion to digital delivery of TV signals -- that are producing what Mr. Iger called ''monumental seismic shifts'' in the business. **********''Nobody knows where the earth is going to stop moving,'' he said. **********In the past year, jumping in has meant, among other things, Internet investments. ABC and NBC acquired Internet portals -- Go and Snap, respectively -- and CBS took interests in a number of smaller Internet businesses like Marketwatch.com and Office.com. **********''I do see the Internet as much more an opportunity than a threat,'' Mr. Wright of NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company, said. Thomas S. Rogers, president of NBC business development, said: ''The traditional network business may be challenged. But there is upside potential as well, given a network's ability to reinvent itself and develop value that is hugely bigger over time.'' **********The same forces driving up ad revenue even as audiences decline provide the networks with what some predict will be significant benefits as soon as next year. ''The incredible promotional platform represented by the networks is going to provide them with big opportunities,'' Jessica Reif-Cohen, an analyst for Merrll Lynch & Company, said. **********The networks have taken steps to exert more authority over their affiliated stations and cut costs through layoffs and tightened reins on program expenses, Ms. Reif-Cohen noted. She predicted that ''investor sentiment will swing wildly in favor of the broadcast networks this year.'' **********Most of the networks' rivals in cable television and new media industries continue to dismiss them as dinosaurs trying to stave off extinction. For example, one senior Internet executive called the networks' Internet strategy largely meaningless. They will never be able to be big enough in that industry to be significant players, the executive said. **********''At least some of what they are doing now is just trying not to look left out,'' the executive said. ''I sympathize with them. If I were in their business, I wouldn't know what to do either.'' **********The networks want to protect their economic base, while they reinvent themselves. That means squeezing every cost they can. For example, networks have long paid studios a flat fee for the rights to two broadcasts of a show. But Mr. Iger said the system simply ''does not work anymore,'' because the fees escalate prohibitively after four years if the show turns out to be a hit. **********For networks now, he said, it becomes untenable if another party controls the economics of a program. ''We need to be able to gain some share of the upside that the new technology allows,'' Mr. Iger said. **********One result of that strategy is a move toward even more vertical integration, with networks trying to own every piece of programming they can. **********Indeed, senior executives at Hollywood production studios said that the demands by networks for stakes in shows have turned deal-making into, as one called it, ''the wild West -- there are no rules at all, a deal isn't a deal anymore.'' **********The networks expect to capitalize by replaying -- or in their term ''repurposing'' -- shows on digital channels or cable channels that they own. ABC plans to do that with soap operas it owns on a proposed Soap Opera Channel. **********Then there is the possibility, through the technology of video streaming, of showing programs on the Internet. **********The networks also expect to sell products related to their shows, though Mr. Wright of NBC said that is so far a very small part of the business plan. ''Today it isn't much of a business, but it may be quite attractive in two to three years.'' **********Out of the same desire to control as much of their financial destiny as possible, the networks continue to press to own more TV stations. Federal regulations limit them to owning stations that reach 35 percent of the country's households, and the networks are lobbying to raise that percentage. **********Mr. Wright said one threat facing the networks was consolidation by cable companies. Cable systems, he said, could soon reach enough viewers in a single city to become serious competitors to local broadcast stations for local advertising. **********Fox, which is owned by the News Corporation, has been less active in aligning with Internet sites -- though Peter Chernin, chairman of the Fox Entertainment Group, said the company would be announcing some deals in the next few weeks. **********He argued that any convergence of TV set and computer would only enhance his company's position because of its 40 percent interest in the TV Guide cable channel. Mr. Chernin called that channel, which identifies what shows are on what cable channel, ''the mother of all portals.'' **********But network executives still question how much interaction viewers will have with their television sets, even after it is wired to be on line. **********For the most part, Mr. Wright said, ''I think the functions of television and computer will stay separate.'' Particularly with entertainment shows, he said, ''I just think that people still will want to watch just to relax.'' **********To Mr. Iger, much more in doubt is what the next generation of TV viewers -- what he called ''the mouse-click generation'' -- will do. **********''Our kids have been raised to be multitaskers,'' he said. ''They're comfortable being active rather than passive, and that should not be ignored.''"

This fall, however, investors have been learning that investing in gold mining stocks can be just as frustrating. **********On Sept. 26, European central banks announced plans to limit gold sales, setting off a convulsive rally in the prices of both the metal and the stocks. But while gold has retreated modestly from its peak on Oct. 5, the mining stocks have sold off with a vengeance. In fact, the price of gold was $282.75 an ounce on Friday, still up 4.7 percent from its pre-rally level, but the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index, which tracks 10 mining stocks, closed at  64.79, down 9.3 percent over that period. **********The divergence has two causes, one of them very recent: the Bank of England's sale last week of almost 25 metric tons of bullion -- a move that hit the stocks harder than it hit gold or gold futures. **********The more enduring issue, however, is that most gold producers have hedged some or all of their production -- using futures or options to lock in spot market prices and protect themselves from erosion in gold's value. **********At least twice during October, gold companies disclosed their hedging exposure and, as a result, suffered steep declines in stock prices. And  the spreading weakness in gold stocks since then has stemmed from a growing perception among investors that hedging problems are pervasive. **********''Higher gold prices are not necessarily a green light for gold stock investors,'' said John C. Tumazos, metals and mining analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''Many firms will not be able to achieve meaningful profitability from the latest rally.'' **********In their quarterly reports, gold mining companies do not break out  the interest expenses associated with borrowing or leasing gold. So investing in such stocks is something of a gamble for those seeking gains from a rise in the price of the metal. **********Despite the blow-ups, investors should not lose sight of the fundamentals underlying the gold prices, some experts said. George Milling-Stanley, manager of gold market analysis for the World Gold Council, a trade group, noted that worldwide demand has exceeded output for several years, but central bank lending and sales had more than filled the gap and depressed prices. **********Alan Snyder of Snyder Capital Management in San Francisco said  ''the whole psychology has changed'' since the Sept. 26 announcement. ''Banks will lend less, hedge funds will short less, and producers will short less,'' he said. **********The bulls, however, differ in the best way to play improving gold fundamentals. **********Mr. Tumazos favors Franco-Nevada Mining and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold. Both have solid long-term reserve growth prospects and  no hedging liabilities, he noted. **********Mr. Snyder said Golden Star Resources, in Denver, would benefit proportionately more than other stocks if gold prices rose. That is because a big part of its reserves would finally become profitable to extract. ''If gold goes to $350, it's a home run for them,'' he said. **********Jean-Marie Eveillard, manager of the $20 million SoGen Gold fund, said he worried about financial stability and mining risk -- the possibility that a mine will yield less than expected -- as well as a firm's hedging exposure. He favors larger, more stable companies like Newmont Mining, Placer Dome and Homestake Mining, all of which have diversified holdings. **********Of course, Mr. Eveillard said, buying gold bullion or coins eliminates the stock price risk, but the bulk gold earns no income."

Investors, they said, seemed to be unusually quick to abandon the company on a mere whiff of bad news. **********''The market punishes a company with a revenue shortfall, so I thought it would be down a few points,'' said William J. Milton, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. ''But this is shocking.'' **********The company's stock closed at $29.5625, down $15.6875, or 37.13 percent, with an unusually heavy 23 million shares changing hands. **********Mr. Milton attributed part of the sharp drop to the trend among investors to pick stocks that have ''momentum.'' As soon as a company's growth falters, these shareholders rush to bail out. **********Unisys, an old-line maker of ''big iron'' mainframe computers, has been struggling to find a niche in today's tough market. Its chief executive, Lawrence A. Weinbach, has focused on technology services -- helping companies develop and operate their computer systems -- while focusing its computer business on building powerful machines to run Microsoft's Windows NT. **********Until yesterday, the strategy had seemed to be working. **********''This company, under Larry Weinbach, has done nothing but meet and beat expectations,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''So when they disappoint, it makes it that much worse.'' **********Unisys earnings were $138 million, up 48 percent from a year ago. **********The third-quarter earnings included a one-time tax benefit of $22 million, partly offset by a charge of $12 million, reflecting the cost of buying back high-interest debt. Excluding these items, the company earned 40 cents a share, above the 36 cents that analysts expected. **********Investors, however, were more focused on the company's sales than on its profits. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $1.87 billion. The company said that the rising dollar had hurt its sales. Without the effect of currency fluctuations, its revenue would have increased 7 percent, it said. **********The company said that revenue in its service unit increased 4 percent, less than the 11 to 12 percent expected, because of shortfalls in its computer networks unit. **********In particular, there was a delay in financing for a big project for the Internal Revenue Service, and it lost several project bids because competition drove the price too low, executives said. **********''Larry is erring on the side of making money rather than growing revenue, which is a very mature approach,'' Mr. Milunovich said of Mr. Weinbach. **********Offsetting the shortfall in revenue from services, the company said its sales of hardware were ahead of expectations. But it said that this was probably a temporary gain, because its customers had accelerated purchases to avoid installing new equipment right before the year 2000 date change, and thus hardware sales would probably fall off sharply in the fourth quarter. **********Over all, Unisys predicted that its  revenue would increase by just 4 percent for the entire year. But it said it would meet earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter and that revenue would accelerate next year, once concerns about Year 2000 computer problems had passed. **********It also announced that executives who ran two of its three largest divisions had resigned ''to pursue other opportunities.'' They were Gerald A. Gagliardi, 51, who ran the maintenance and service division, and Lawrence C. Russell, 60, who oversaw the consulting unit."

The odds of the games insure that over the long run, the house will come out ahead. **********But that does not immunize them against nasty surprises in the short run. Mirage Resorts Inc. shocked Wall Street earlier this month when it warned that its profit for the second quarter would be 7 to 10 cents a share, well below expectations of 24 cents a share. The company chalked up 6 cents of that shortfall, an amount analysts say is equivalent to nearly $20 million in pretax income, to plain bad luck: Its ''hold percentage'' on table games -- the money it retains as a percentage of the amount of chips bought -- was only 16.7 percent, instead of the 20 percent it expected. **********''I'm amazed,'' Mirage's chairman, Stephen A. Wynn, told analysts during a conference call, adding that it was highly unusual to have three consecutive months of disappointing hold percentages in all the company's casinos. **********Other casino companies have also had unlucky quarters from time to time. But winnings for Mirage can be particularly volatile, because it caters to high rollers, gamblers who might bet $100,000 or more on a hand of cards. The law of averages does not work as consistently for a few large bets as it does for thousands of smaller ones, and one lucky weekend for a high roller can cost a casino dearly. **********''There are millions of gamblers in Las Vegas every year,'' said Glenn Schaeffer, president of Mandalay Resort Group, once known as Circus Circus Enterprises. ''But there are only a couple of hundred that can swing your table results.'' **********High rollers tend to prefer playing baccarat, and casino winnings from that card game are so volatile that analysts often exclude them when assessing industry trends. Month to month over the last three years, the combined hold percentage for baccarat for all casinos on the Las Vegas Strip has varied from 4.7 percent to 26.9 percent, according to Bear, Stearns & Company. By contrast, the combined monthly hold percentage for all other table games varied only between 10.3 and 18.5 percent. **********Casinos have a built-in advantage in the games they offer, governed largely by the laws of probability, with a few games influenced slightly by players' skill. On a standard Las Vegas roulette wheel, for example, the house's advantage is 5.26 percent, meaning that the casino will come out ahead by an average of $5.26 for every $100 bet. **********But there is more to the hold percentage -- and casino profits -- than statistical advantages and luck, said Olaf Vancura, director of gaming products at Mikohn Gaming, a Las Vegas-based developer of table games. A crucial factor is how long players keep on betting with their winnings. **********Casinos cannot measure directly how much is bet on table games, so they calculate hold percentages based on how many chips are sold. A roulette player who bets $100 will have, on average, $94.74 to show for it, given the 5.26 percent house advantage. But the player is likely to bet all or part of that $94.74 again, and to lose some more. If he bets long enough, the entire $100 will be exhausted, making the casino's hold percentage for that player 100 percent, even though the house did not win on every spin of the wheel. (In actual play, the hold percentage for roulette tends to run a bit over 20 percent, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.) **********The house's statistical edge in baccarat is the smallest of any game, slightly above 1 percent, said Dr. Vancura, who has a Ph.D. in physics. Yet the baccarat hold percentage on the Strip averages 16 percent, indicating that gamblers play through their chips 10 times or more. **********So could it be that Mirage's problems are more than just an unlucky turn of the cards? Are its high rollers, lured with free flights, free meals and free deluxe suites, staying a shorter time at the Mirage's baccarat tables? Mirage says no. **********Jason Ader, the casino industry analyst at Bear, Stearns, said he thinks there has been an overall decline in the hold percentage for baccarat, because many of the high rollers are Asians who may be reluctant to endure sustained losses because of financial turmoil in their home countries. **********The Strip's aggregate hold percentage for baccarat did drop to 15.1 percent in 1998,  from 17.3 percent in 1997. But the data are inconclusive: This year through April, the baccarat hold rebounded to 17.8 percent. And even the low 1998 figure was higher than in 1996, before the Asian crisis began. **********Casino executives say they do not concentrate on increasing hold percentages, but rather on increasing the volume of betting, because they trust that the casino's winnings will meet expectations over time. For its part, Mirage said the number of chips bought by bettors during the unlucky quarter was ''pretty decent.'' And analysts paid less attention to Mirage's low hold percentage than to other parts of the company's announcement that suggested it was not attracting as many customers as hoped, potentially a far more serious problem. **********James J. Murren, chief financial officer at MGM Grand, which recently opened its Mansion -- a complex of deluxe villas for high rollers -- said that because so much is bet on each turn of the cards, profit margins  from baccarat are often the highest of any game, making it worthwhile to put up with the volatility of winnings. ''You don't make that your base level of earnings,'' he said. ''You make that your gravy.'' **********Baccarat's impact on earnings is diminishing as casino companies derive more of their income from rooms, restaurants, shops and entertainment. When the Hilton Hotels Corporation owned only a few casinos, its chairman, Baron Hilton, checked the baccarat results at the Las Vegas Hilton almost every morning, so important were they to the company's results. Now, Park Place Entertainment, the gambling spinoff from Hilton that owns 17 casinos, boasts that baccarat accounts for only 4 percent of its revenue, although the company said last week that its second-quarter earnings were lower than in the corresponding period a year earlier, in part because of a decline in baccarat play. **********Casinos are also filling more of their gambling space with slot machines, for which the calculations are simpler: The hold percentage for slots is nearly identical to the house's statistical advantage because the machines count every bet made. Management can readily adjust the hold up or down by tinkering with the machines' settings, so the figures contain hints about casino strategy that could be revealing to gamblers. **********For example, the house's take on nickel slot machines -- 9.78 percent, on average, on the Strip in 1998 -- is twice as steep as on dollar machines. Translation: a player has a better chance of winning at the dollar machines. (But a player is likely to lose more money in a dollar machine, because the bets are so much bigger.) **********Quarter slots in North Las Vegas, where most of the players are locals, held 3.23 percent in 1998, less than half the rate of similar machines on the Strip, where most of the tourists play. **********For table game players, the fact that the casino's hold percentage is much greater than its statistical advantage points to one rule: The more you play, the more you lose."

But, as the Web has matured, and the computers and software that run it have become more powerful and fancier, Web sites that deal with tax information have become more sophisticated. Even the venerable Internal Revenue Service has tax forms on a Web site that can be filled out on line and printed, a far cry from the days when everything had to be downloaded, printed and then filled out by hand. **********Some of this change comes about as a result of the I.R.S. E-file program, in which tax returns can be filed electronically, whether by telephone or computer. That has spurred an increase in the number of Web sites that can handle tax calculations and filing through a browser, something unheard of a few years ago. **********Last year, about 25 million returns were filed electronically, about one in five, according to the I.R.S. This year, the agency expects that number to climb to about 30 million. That  is a significant change for the I.R.S., which still has its employees retype all the information that comes in on each paper return, whether it was filled out by hand or with a computer -- and even if it comes in on the 1040PC form. Every return that comes in electronically is one fewer to be retyped; the I.R.S. says the money saved will be redirected to customer service and upgraded computer systems. And there is a great deal of room for improvement, with a collection of computer systems dating from the 1950's. **********According to the I.R.S., half the professionally prepared personal returns are prepared on computers, but fewer than a quarter of those are filed electronically. A paltry 28,000 of the approximately 9 million individual extension requests are filed electronically. And a not-very-impressive 1,000 of the 23.8 million payments that accompany individual returns are received electronically, leaving the I.R.S. awash in a sea of paperwork and perpetuating a process that is prone to error. **********Traditional tax software providers like Intuit and H&R Block have jumped on the E-file bandwagon. They have been joined by companies like One Tax that provide information as well as software and on-line filing services. The incentive for consumers to use such services is the promise of easier filing and faster refunds. **********The sites that have the Web-based tax programs offer tax advice that is usually quite useful. H&R Block's Kiplinger Tax Cut (www.taxcut .com), for example, offers a section titled 50 Ways to Cut Your Taxes. **********Not all the sites offer taxpayers the opportunity to file electronically. Many simply provide tax information. And since most people tend to do their taxes at night and on weekends, the Internet is perfect place to get answers to questions. Even for the 80 percent of filers who still use paper."

Some have quit trading the most popular stocks of on-line investors or shut their automatic trading systems, delaying orders by up to 20 minutes. **********Meanwhile on-line brokerage firms are continuing to have problems like Web pages that are slow to load, servers that conk out and some trades that fail to be executed. **********Trying to cope with the turmoil, some brokerage firms like Waterhouse Securities Inc. are requiring on-line investors to make trades in the most volatile stocks by talking to a broker instead of using a computer. Many firms, including the Charles Schwab Corporation, the on-line trading leader, have limited or eliminated the ability of customers to own some of their stock through margin loans. And others are scaling back the aggressive advertising that industry analysts say has contributed to the Internet logjam. **********Still, investors and some industry officials worry that a big market tumble could completely freeze out on-line traders. **********''If on normal days this doesn't work at all, that's a bad enough problem, but whenever there is a big downdraft on the market, a lot of people are going to be shut out,'' said Steve Salgo, a computer programmer in Plano, Tex., who trades stock options from his home. He said he has changed on-line brokers eight times in hopes of improving performance, but things only got worse during the last few weeks. ''Most of the time there is a slow response. And then sometimes there is no response.'' **********But Bernard L. Madoff, whose firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities is one of the largest market makers, said, ''This thing is not going to stop until people start losing money. I've never seen this type of mania, people trading 100 and 200 shares without any regard to fundamentals.'' **********Attempting to address the extreme volatility in some stocks and initial public offerings, a special Nasdaq committee of market makers, brokerage firms and other industry officials will meet again today to discuss whether to recommend any trading-rule changes to the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Already, the group has suggested extending the time market makers have to post prices before an initial public offering begins trading, but the S.E.C. has not acted on the recommendation. **********Other ideas under discussion include allowing Nasdaq officials to temporarily halt trading in extremely volatile stocks and requiring retail customers buying shares immediately following an initial public offering to place limit orders that guarantee they will not be filled at a price far higher than they expected to pay, according to a person involved in the discussions. **********Analysts predict investors will see more Internet delays this week, even though popular high-flying stocks with on-line traders like Amazon.com Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have now fallen more than 30 percent from their highs two weeks ago. But some industry officials say the stunning rise in on-line trading volume this year has begun to level off. **********Still, ''I think it's going to take a slowdown in the market in combination with more infrastructure spending to turn this around; that will take months,'' said John Robb, co-founder of Gomez Advisors Inc., an Internet consulting firm in Concord, Mass. He said on-line brokerage firms' failure rates -- the number of times Web pages failed to load -- rose 63 percent in the first week of January, compared with the average rate during the third quarter of 1998, and he said the situation has not improved since. **********At Waterhouse, Web trading went down for about 35 minutes on Tuesday and another few minutes Wednesday, said John Chapel, the company's president. For the time being, the firm has cut back advertising and prohibited trading in 10 stocks through its Web site, including Amazon.com and Yahoo. The firm has eliminated margin borrowing for the same 10 stocks, meaning customers who call Waterhouse to place a trade in those stocks must cover the entire price of their purchase with money in their accounts. **********The temporary measures will be reversed when ''the frothiness lifts,'' Mr. Chapel said. **********The number of on-line trades has held steady at Discover Brokerage Direct after jumping more than 20 percent at the beginning of the year, said Tom O'Connell, executive vice president. ''We are looking at this as our new level,'' he said. The firm, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, has eliminated all margin lending on 16 stocks, up from just two issues six weeks ago. **********The problems have spilled over to Nasdaq market makers, and at one point at least 16 had stopped trading Amazon.com, Mr. Madoff said. Many that continue to trade the most volatile stocks have removed them from their automated trade systems and are executing them by hand, causing trades that normally take 2 to 20 seconds to take up to 20 minutes, he said. His firm has temporarily stopped trading Yahoo, Amazon.com and the Infoseek Corporation, though it is still averaging about 125,000 trades a day in other issues. **********While the most extreme volatility may have abated somewhat, industry analysts expect on-line trading growth to continue to surge throughout the year. On-line trades now account for 25 percent to 30 percent of all retail stock trades, double their market share a year ago, according to Gomez Advisors. The firm expects the number of on-line brokerage accounts to top 10 million by the end of the year, up from 6.8 million at the end of 1998."

Shrewd marketing and a robust economy have given premium Napa wines a romance and prestige that help lift sales of wine produced throughout the state. **********Napa winemaking has proven so successful, in fact, that there is very little land left on the valley floor to plant new vines. To expand output, the wineries are planting on the surrounding hillsides, arousing a backlash driven by environmental concerns  ranging from water pollution caused by soil erosion and pesticides to the destruction of oak trees and wildlife habitat. **********Pushed by environmentalists, the Napa County Board of Supervisors has already enacted regulations aimed at curbing hillside vineyards, and the board's five elected members are being pressed by constituents to make the rules even more restrictive. **********Winemakers say hillsides are not only the last available land for Napa vineyards but also the best land for producing world-class wine grapes -- though the most expensive to develop. At the very least, they say, the new rules would drive development costs even higher. Planting a new hillside vineyard costs $35,000 to $40,000 an acre, on top of the price of the land. **********''We need to conserve habitat,'' said Chris Malan, a county mental health counselor who leads Concerned Citizens for Napa Hillsides, a small but politically vocal environmental group. ''We need to protect our tree canopy. We need to not construct infrastructure in the hillsides that causes flooding.'' **********Napa County's landmark 1991 hillside ordinance permits farming on slopes with grades as steep as 22.5 degrees, or 50 percent, meaning the land rises one foot for every two horizontal feet. Ms. Malan wants the county to tighten that limit to 30 percent. Better still, she said, would be a moratorium on all new vineyard development. ''This is a very small county,'' she said. ''We have to reach the limit at some point.'' **********Because of Napa's national reputation, the fight has attracted attention from environmental groups across the country. They say they will not hesitate to intervene if measures to clean up the Napa River and protect wildlife seem inadequate. **********''If it's just a matter of saying, 'We're going to do some study and crack down on future development,' then that won't solve the problem,'' said Bruce Hamilton, conservation director for the Sierra Club. ''California, using Federal standards, classified the Napa River as impaired in 1987. If the state fails to act, then the Federal Government could step in. **********''And if neither acts,'' he added, ''then a private group like the Sierra Club could,'' by going to court. **********Winemakers say county figures show that soil erosion has declined by more than two-thirds since 1991. ''Many of us think the current ordinance is pretty damn good and the problem is enforcing it,'' said Dennis Groth, president of Groth Vineyards in Oakville. **********The wine growers cautiously embraced recommendations by a county task force that recently evaluated Napa's hillside ordinance. The task force, whose members included winemakers and environmentalists as well as engineers and government officials, rejected proposals like a moratorium on new vineyards and extending the rules to cover replanting of existing vineyards grandfathered under the 1991 law. Instead, it called for further study. **********Compliance with the law is largely voluntary; enforcement is limited to responding to the public's complaints, according to county officials. The number of vineyards that break the rules, while thought to be small, is not known. **********Still, the problems that have come to light have been damaging for the winemakers. ''When somebody violates the law, the finger points at all of us,'' said Thomas Shelton, chief executive of Joseph Phelps Vineyards and president of the Napa Vintners Association. ''Enforcement of existing regulations is something we can all agree on.'' **********Some in Napa say that planting hillsides does not make economic sense anyway. **********''The issue is not growth; the issue is profit,'' said Volker Eisele, a vintner and grape grower with 60 acres who is also an environmental activist. ''When land values and business values climb to such astronomical heights, there is a lot at stake.'' For what it now costs to develop hillside vineyards, he said, ''to make such a venture pay, you're looking at a $60 to $80 bottle price, and I have trouble believing that you can project that kind of price into the future.'' **********Mr. Eisele said the Napa industry should grow by increasing quality, not quantity. **********For Stuart Smith, whose 30-acre Smith-Madrone Vineyards and Winery lies nearly 1,000 feet above St. Helena in the Mayacamas Range, growth is very much an issue. Mr. Smith, who is seeking county permission to convert six and a half more acres into vineyards, says modern agricultural techniques can minimize soil erosion and habitat loss. And no one should underestimate nature's resilience, he said. **********He pointed to a faded redwood stake, one of many he has found on his property, that supported a grapevine more than a century ago. The tall pine trees and scrub that now surround it are evidence of the forest's regenerative vitality, he said. **********''The forest wants to take back the vineyards,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It's a constant battle for us to keep the forest at bay.''"

Explorers often set out without knowing where they were headed, or how long it would take. **********We are all in the same boat, but our task is simpler: not to run out of supplies. **********''The biggest fear of the elderly is: What if I outlive my money?'' said Raymond G. Russolillo, the director of personal financial services for PricewaterhouseCoopers. **********Jerry Mason, who teaches family financial planning at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, put it another way: ''I don't think there is much correlation between money and happiness above a certain point -- but if you wind up on the welfare rolls, there is.'' **********Complicating the picture is the best news possible about retirement: it doesn't end as soon as it used to. **********Most experts urge a person considering retiring early, at age 55, to accumulate resources sufficient to last 30 years. In contrast, according to Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm, that person's parents typically had only a 20-year retirement and their great-grandparents, a 5-year retirement. **********What that means is that financial preparation is more of a process than a blueprint. Think of it as a series of midcourse corrections, to be made periodically or as personal circumstances and the economy change. **********Retirement Quiz **********Here is a short list of questions that sketch out the kind of factors involved: *********** How long are you likely to live? Unanswerable, of course, but important. A starting point for that consideration is the life-expectancy tables published by MetLife and others (men who have reached 65 can expect to live another 15.9 years; women, 19). Family history and personal health should also be considered. *********** How much money do you need each year? A rule of thumb is 70 percent or 80 percent of current annual cash flow, but it is better to do a careful individual cash flow analysis. A couple moving to a Florida condominium, for example, may have a very different situation from people who want to keep living in their large family home in Westchester County. *********** How much will come in from pensions and Social Security? *********** How much of a nest egg will be needed to make up the difference? This requires projections for inflation and rate of return on investment. **********Mistakes Not to Make **********One area of certainty, at least to financial planners, is the mistakes they see. **********Mr. Russolillo cautions that one of the most serious errors in recent years has been fostered by the stock market boom. ''People assume they are going to get 20 or 25 percent in the market because they have over the last few years,'' he said. ''I always try to pull them back and think of 8 percent before tax,'' a figure that is more warranted by history than are the red-hot returns of recent years. **********Martin Nissenbaum, the national director of retirement planning for Ernst & Young, said another common error among retirees is to let safety over-dominate their investment strategies. Many people move their assets into fixed income investments (bonds or other debt instruments) as they approach retirement, he said, seeking to avoid the risk of volatile stock markets. ''But you have to continue looking for growth,'' so your nest egg can expand to modern longer lifespans. And that essentially means keeping a substantial part of your assets in stocks. **********Avery E. Neumark, a principal in the accounting firm of Rosen Seymour Shapss Martin & Company and the firm's director of employee benefits, offers a rough guideline for asset allocation: 120 minus your age equals the percentage of assets that should be in stocks; the rest can go into bonds. **********Mr. Neumark cited another error, perhaps the most basic of all: ''People start focusing on retirement later than they should.'' He added, ''You cannot save enough for retirement because there are always surprises that come in -- inflation, life style.'' **********Are there people who get so anxious that they compulsively save too much? ''I have never seen that problem in my whole career,'' Mr. Neumark said. **********Professor Mason, a former director of education for the International Association for Financial Planning, advises people to begin by putting away money systematically in any employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)'s, ''because basically, we are all like children in the candy store.'' Money in our jeans will be spent. If it is withheld before we get it, we may be able to adjust our life styles to fit the take-home pay and leave the savings to grow for later years. **********Playing Catch Up **********People who address the issue relatively late may not be able to save enough in what are known as qualified plans, tax-deferred plans like employer-sponsored pension plans, 401(k) plans and Keogh plans for the self-employed. In that case, Mr. Neumark said, their options are the following: *********** Supplement those savings with investments in regular brokerage or mutual fund accounts. *********** Think about not retiring so early, or take a new job in retirement. *********** Adjust the retirement budget. **********One possibility for people who are contributing as much as possible to qualified plans, but who fear they will not have enough, is a tax-deferred annuity -- essentially a mutual fund sold with an insurance wrapper. The downside is that fees run higher than they do for a similar mutual fund. **********Mr. Nissenbaum said he occasionally recommends annuities, but noted ''you can basically create your own annuity'' by investing in an index fund -- a mutual fund that mimics an index like the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. There is very little current capital gains tax with such a holding, he said, because there is very little portfolio turnover. And when you sell holdings after retirement, capital gains are taxed at favorable rates. In contrast, any money that comes out of qualified plans or I.R.A.'s is taxed as ordinary income. **********''What's not good is to have too optimistic a plan,'' Mr. Neumark said. ''I'd rather have a cushion.'' **********Mr. Neumark advises reviewing and updating a plan ''no less than annually.'' **********Indeed, when contemplating a 30-year retirement, think back to 1969, when the Dow Jones industrial average closed the year at 800; $15,000 a year was a reasonable middle-class salary, and a new car cost $2,000. **********Who would have projected that inflation would gallop into double digits within 10 years and appear almost moribund 20 years after that; that within 25 years downsizing would dominate the corporate landscape, or that medical advances would make 85 a reasonable life expectancy? **********This is not to say past is prologue -- just to say that although long-term financial planning is fraught with uncertainties, those who plan, and save accordingly, will surely be in a better position to deal with life's vicissitudes. ''I'm amazed at the people I see who have not put a penny away,'' Professor Mason said, adding, ''I think we are soon to see a real inflation of the welfare rolls, 75-year-olds in poverty,'' citing as an example the elderly man seen bagging groceries at the supermarket. **********But remember, time is your ally. It irons out the volatility of the market, while compound growth multiplies your savings. Then, if your rate of withdrawal in retirement is equal to or below your rate of return, you will never run out of money."

His reason: Sports Illustrated, as an example, does not score hits with readers when it features controversial articles.

But allied officials said Russia, a key diplomatic player, was keeping its distance. **********The allies kept up the pressure on Serbian forces with 778 missions overnight, including 319 bombing runs and 89 attacks on Serbian air defenses. Gen. Ljubisa Velickovic, a Yugoslav Deputy Chief of Staff, was killed in air strikes near Belgrade, military officials there reported. **********Air attacks on Serbian forces fighting rebel Kosovo Liberation Army troops near the Albanian border continued today, and international observers there reported that seven bombs had fallen on Albanian territory. **********One allied official said tonight that the attacks, in an area where Serbian forces have often shown little concern about crossing the border, were deliberate. But later NATO spokesmen said allied missiles had landed in Albania by mistake. Bombing of Serbian military targets inside Yugoslavia would continue to intensify, they said, in what could be a crucial two weeks of negotiations. ''It's a convergence of increased bombing and diplomacy,'' one Western diplomat said. **********While the Serbs are accusing NATO forces of having killed more than 30 civilians since Sunday, NATO has not confirmed that it was responsible for the deaths and dozens of injuries. **********With allied attacks focusing more on installations like power plants, bridges and roads that civilians are also using, Jamie P. Shea, the NATO spokesman, said today, it was inevitable that there would be more civilian casualties, though allied pilots do their best to avoid striking civilian targets. **********If peace does break out, Britain has alerted up to 12,000 light infantry soldiers to be ready to join the 5,300 troops it already has in Macedonia for a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and France said this week that it could provide 6,000 to 7,000 troops, about as many as the United States has said it is willing to offer. Italy also has close to 8,000 soldiers in Albania, where they are helping refugees from Kosovo. **********The 19 NATO allies agreed last week that because of widespread destruction and dislocation in Kosovo, restoring normal life and security there would take more than the 28,000 peacekeeping soldiers they had planned to send in earlier this spring if the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, had accepted a negotiated settlement providing autonomy for the province. **********Many European officials say they are now hoping that a new diplomatic push by a former Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, could produce Yugoslav agreement to an international peacekeeping force. They also hope that Russia will join the push by the time eight industrial democracies, including the United States and Russia, gather in Cologne on June 18 for a summit meeting. **********The Cologne meeting is seen as a crucial negotiating deadline, but whether Mr. Chernomyrdin can persuade Mr. Milosevic to accept terms that would get the allies to stop the bombing is still uncertain. **********One allied official said today that the larger NATO force now being planned if diplomacy does succeed would have about 45,000 soldiers from NATO countries and other neutral or formerly Communist nations that have cooperation agreements with the alliance. Another 10,000 troops would remain outside Kosovo providing supplies and other support, the official said. **********Military representatives from NATO and 12 non-NATO countries attended a conference on the peacekeeping mission today at the allied military headquarters in Mons, Belgium. They offered individual combat, logistical, and engineering units for an international force big enough to move into the province after the fighting stops and escort hundreds of thousands of refugees back to their shattered homes. Officials said final decisions would be made after allied commanders reviewed the offers and some participating countries got approval from their parliaments. **********Peacekeepers would go in, according to NATO, only if a new round of diplomacy finally produced agreement by Mr. Milosevic to stop the fighting and withdraw Serbian forces from Kosovo. If diplomacy fails by the time of the June 18 summit meeting, one official here said, the allies might then have to start formal planning for a much larger force to fight its way into Kosovo. **********Russia, which has about 1,500 peacekeepers serving with allied forces in Bosnia, has refused to participate in planning for a peacekeeping force, according to officials here.  Russia suspended all formal cooperation with the alliance after it started bombing military targets all over Yugoslavia on March 24. **********Despite the bombing, an allied military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, said today that 40,000 Serbian troops remained in Kosovo, about as many as there were when the allies started the air operation 70 days ago. **********Mr. Shea said Mr. Milosevic was forcing men in their 50's to join the Yugoslav Army. ''He is now drawing on his last human resources to keep the numbers level,'' Mr. Shea said. **********General Jertz described ''fierce fighting'' between Serbian forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army  near the border with Albania during the last 24 hours, and said that NATO warplanes had bombed 84 pieces of Serbian combat equipment in the battle zone. **********Altogether, General Jertz said, the allies had bombed 314 Serbian artillery pieces, 120 tanks and 203 other armored vehicles in Kosovo since the beginning of the air campaign. **********The allies hoped bombing would force a halt to Serbian attacks against the ethnic Albanian majority in the province. **********Instead, Mr. Milosevic's army, police and paramilitary forces continued combat operations that have now driven 800,000 ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo and forced most of the rest, nearly 600,000, to take to the hills. **********The allies have flown 31,529 individual missions in 70 days, General Jertz said, including thousands of strikes against Serbian antiaircraft missiles and the radar and communications sites that the air defense system uses to track attacking planes. **********Despite more than two months of bombing, according to the allies, the Serbian military still has 59 percent of its petroleum reserves. More than 40 percent of Yugoslavia's fuel reserves and 63 percent of its oil storage plants remain untouched, NATO says."

Albright complained yesterday that Congressional unwillingness to pay what the United States owes to the United Nations has hamstrung the Administration's ability to influence the organization. **********''There's no reason to hide it,'' Ms. Albright said. ''They resent us deeply because we are not paying, and we are the backbone of the U.N.'' **********The Secretary expressed her frustration in the course of briefing reporters about her meetings yesterday with a succession of foreign ministers and other senior officials attending the opening sessions of the General Assembly. **********Ms. Albright said the accumulated arrears, which the United Nations estimates at $1.6 billion, have made it particularly difficult to recruit allies for the kind of structural reforms that Congress demands as a condition of paying the back dues and other assessments. **********''What is happening up here is that they see us as making certain demands that undercut a bureaucracy that they have some interest in, while not paying any money,'' she said. **********The Secretary's warning about the debt is hardly new. She expressed it when she was the chief American delegate to the United Nations. **********But her latest complaint comes on the heels of President Clinton's speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday, in which he promised to ''do our very best to succeed this year'' in meeting financial obligations to the United Nations. **********Mr. Clinton's promise got a cool reception, with some diplomats asserting that he has neither the influence nor the will to get Congress to honor a treaty obligation that the United States assumed when it helped form the United Nations 54 years ago. The contentious mood is unlikely to have escaped Ms. Albright in her various meetings today. **********''I feel it's very difficult for the United States to assume a leadership role as long as we don't pay our bills,'' she said. **********Earlier this morning at her suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Ms. Albright discussed prospects for reviving the Syrian-Israeli peace talks with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara. Both countries have expressed interest in picking up the talks, which convened briefly in late 1995. But they remain far apart on the critical question of Israel's return of the Golan Heights, which it captured during the 1967 war. **********''There is an interest to move forward from both sides,'' said Ms. Albright, who spoke several times about a mutual seriousness of purpose. But she cautioned that a breakthrough would not take place in a single meeting. **********The Secretary held other meetings yesterday with Foreign Minister Amre Mahmoud Moussa of Egypt and with President Glafcos Clarides of Cyprus. She was also to meet the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat."

That is the dispute over whether the Irish Republican Army must start disarming as a condition for the members of its political wing, Sinn Fein, to take their seats in a new Northern Ireland Assembly cabinet. **********The showdown over arms decommissioning had provoked gloomy predictions this week that the whole painstaking peace process, which has passed through many moments of menacing crises, might not survive this one. **********A new declaration by the British and Irish Governments that emerged from today's session sought to balance the Ulster Unionist Party's demand for I.R.A. disarmament with Sinn Fein's insistence that there can be no such precondition. It said simply that ''while there is no precondition to decommission, there is an obligation to decommission.'' **********It was on Good Friday a year ago that the parties agreed to the peace settlement aimed at ending violence between Catholics and Protestants that has cost more than 3,200 lives in the last three decades. **********That carefully calibrated accord set up a number of new Government panels aimed at giving equal weight to the largely Protestant desire to keep Northern Ireland British with the widespread Catholic wish to see it move closer to the Irish Republic. **********Central to that agreement was the creation of a new Northern Ireland Assembly that would exercise home-rule powers now in the hands of the British Parliament in London. That shift of authority, scheduled to occur today, would have led to the establishment of a 10-member executive, in which two seats would belong to Sinn Fein because of the count in an election last June. **********Under the formula laid out in today's British-Irish declaration, guerrilla groups will have a month after the nomination of new cabinet members to start handing in guns ''on a voluntary basis.'' **********This is to be done in a ceremony described in the declaration as a ''collective act of reconciliation.''  The moment would include memorial gestures honoring people from both of Northern Ireland's communities who have lost their lives in the  violence. **********An existing international panel, headed by the retired Canadian General John de Chastelain, would verify compliance, and the nominations would be approved only after paramilitary groups were certified as complying. This would appear to allow a party like Sinn Fein to have its two members named to a shadow cabinet but barred from the real cabinet in the absence of any I.R.A. arms turnovers that met with the panel's approval. **********Mr. Blair is hoping that when they reconvene on April 13, the parties will agree to the declaration and use it as a way of clearing the disarmament hurdle. He said he knew that some people would object, but he said they should be disregarded. **********''You've heard them rattling the gates,'' he said, referring to militant Protestant demonstrators who have been loudly protesting the talks through the night at the entrance to Hillsborough Castle. ''Those are the people who have never had anything useful to say about the future of Northern Ireland. They are the people of Northern Ireland's past.'' **********The concern about decommissioning has long been a defining issue in the effort to negotiate a peace in Northern Ireland. One of the earliest challenges of George J. Mitchell, the former United States Senator who was chairman of the talks that produced last year's settlement, was to get around an initial demand from John Major, then the British Prime Minister, that there be disarmament before any talks. **********The talks went forward only when Mr. Mitchell put into place the strategy of ''parallel decommissioning,'' making disarmament a matter for negotiations, not a precondition for them. **********While the tactic succeeded in removing the highly volatile issue as an obstacle to an agreement, it didn't succeed in keeping it from returning, as it has now, as the central focus."

There, in November 1993, the chairman of Intel cut a fateful deal with his counterpart at a small but leading  maker of highly specialized computer work stations, the Intergraph Corporation. **********During the half-hour meeting, according to interviews and court papers, Andrew Grove, Intel's top executive, persuaded James Meadlock, Intergraph's chairman and chief executive, to use Intel as the sole supplier of chips for Intergraph's work stations -- high-performance computers aimed at engineers, architects and others requiring powerful graphics, design and animation capabilities. **********For Intergraph, casting its lot with Intel would mean abandoning its own chip technology and scrapping plans to use Sun Microsystems as an alternate chip supplier. But it would also mean turning to the world's most advanced developer of computer chips, and at the time, a company that had been committed to making products that could be used interchangeably with those made by others. **********For the first few years, the relationship flourished. Intergraph work stations were even featured in Intel's annual reports and in product rollout events like the debut of the Pentium Pro chip, as Intel's efforts to produce ever more powerful chips for customers like Intergraph burnished the chip maker's reputation for being on the cutting edge of technology. But by 1997 the ties between the companies had become frayed, amid bitter charges and countercharges of patent infringement, fraud and misappropriation of trade secrets. **********Intergraph executives say that Intel's decision to withhold technological data in a market that changes as quickly as the computer industry has been a serious corporate setback. In the wake of the falling-out, as Intel racked up ever-higher revenues and profits and saw its share price continue its seemingly inexorable climb, Intergraph has labored under mounting losses. And Intergraph's share price now languishes in the $5 range -- about half its level when Mr. Meadlock made his Comdex pact with Mr. Grove. **********For all of the Federal Trade Commission's charges that Intel had ''sought to extort'' technology from its customers ''in order to preserve its monopoly,'' none are more revealing of the strengths and weaknesses of the Government's case than the accusations by Intergraph. And Mr. Meadlock and Mr. Grove, both pioneers in their respective fields, expect to feature prominently in the trial. **********In fact, the Government plans to call Mr. Meadlock as its first witness this week. And Mr. Meadlock will be followed to the witness stand by Wade Patterson, the president of the company's hardware division. **********The trial, expected to last up to two months, will be heard by an administrative law judge whose decision, either way, is all but certain to be appealed to the next level -- the four members of the Federal Trade Commission. The agency's lawyers have asked for an order that would bar Intel from withholding technical information from customers with which it has disputes. **********Mr. Meadlock and Mr. Grove, both respected pioneers in their fields, expect to feature prominently in the trial. Mr. Meadlock would seem to present a sympathetic figure, an engineer's engineer who was a recipient of the Congressional High Technology Award in 1985, following his work in the 1960's as a top software developer for the Apollo space program and for military systems. **********But then, Mr. Grove, whatever his reputation for tough bargaining,  hardly comes across as a plundering monopolist. A native of Hungary who as a boy during World War II was forced to hide from the Nazis and later fled Soviet domination of his country by emigrating to the United States in the 1950's, is the embodiment of the American success story. Starting with odd jobs that included busboy in a Catskills resort, he rose to become the senior executive of the world's largest chip maker and one of the most profitable companies in  history. **********And so aware is he of the responsibilities and potential pitfalls of Intel's industry dominance that Mr. Grove requires employees to receive training in antitrust law. Yet, by all accounts, his management style is embodied by the title of his 1996 book, an aggressive executive's guide to consumer trends, rival technology and regulatory threats and opportunities: ''Only the Paranoid Survive.'' **********Intel declined to make Mr. Grove available for an interview, saying that he cannot comment while the company is in litigation. **********The Government, besides presenting the Intergraph accusations, has also cited Intel's decision to cut off technology to two other companies -- Compaq Computer and Digital Equipment -- as evidence that the chip maker coerced its major customers into surrendering technology so that Intel could maintain its market dominance. But neither of those companies, which are much bigger than Intergraph and merged last year, has suffered as badly as Intergraph, according to Government officials and Intergraph executives. **********Federal District Judge Edwin L. Nelson concluded last year, in a separate, continuing suit in which he ordered Intel to resume supplying Intergraph with crucial technology and sample chips while the litigation proceeds, that Intel ''violated its affirmative duties as a monopolist not to misuse its monopoly power and to compete in a manner that does not unreasonably or unfairly harm competition.'' **********That opinion, which also ordered Intel to resume supplying technical information to Intergraph, is now on appeal. Intel's lawyers have maintained that its decisions to sharply reduce customer access to technology were lawful and proper. And they contend that even the Government's own expert economist has been unable to find any evidence that Intel's actions harmed either innovation or competition -- a central criteria of Federal antitrust law, they say. **********''Intel's actions were nothing more than a response to the assertion of infringement claims against it,'' the company said in its trial brief in the F.T.C. case. ''Intel's withholding of the right to use its intellectual property from companies that had done the same to Intel was an appropriate  and perfectly normal response to the actions of Digital, Intergraph, and  Compaq.'' **********Mr. Meadlock, in a recent interview, as well as court papers in the F.T.C. case and one of the related lawsuits between the two companies, has said that Mr. Grove assured him at the 1993 Comdex meeting that Intergraph did not need to worry about using Intel as its sole supplier of chips because ''Intel would treat Intergraph fairly.'' **********''The meeting was basically an effort to sell Intergraph on designing  with Intel,'' Mr. Meadlock said. He said Mr. Grove ''had told me that the  openness of the architecture had helped Intel to dominate the industry and that they had no intention of changing that strategy.'' Chips designed with an open architecture are interchangeable with those made by rivals, while those of closed architecture are not. **********As a result of that assurance, Mr. Meadlock said, Intergraph decided to forgo further development of its own high-end chip, called Clipper, and to abandon plans to use Sun Microsystems as a supplier along with Intel. It also spent months redesigning its work stations to make them compatible with Intel products. **********But the relationship between Intergraph and Intel started fraying in late 1996, amid growing complaints from Intergraph that some computer makers that were rivals of Intergraph were infringing on Clipper chip patents by using Intel chips. Intel contended that the Pentium chips had relied on some of the same memory technology in the Clipper chips. When Intergraph threatened to enforce those patents, the companies turned to Intel and asked to be indemnified. **********Mr. Meadlock said that since Intergraph recognized it was ''locked in'' to Intel products, his company did not initially confront Intel about the patent issues, but instead tried to obtain royalties from the computer makers. **********''We knew it was a sensitive issue,'' he said. **********But after the Intergraph rivals  turned to Intel for help, Intel responded by seeking a cross-licensing arrangement that would enable the two partners to each have access to certain patent rights held by the other. **********Those negotiations went nowhere, and in 1997 Intel began responding to Intergraph's requests by withholding technical specifications and samples of new chips that were crucial for Intergraph to design updated versions of its work stations. **********Making things even more difficult for Intergraph was the fact that its work stations were now based on Intel products that were no longer  interchangeable with other companies' chips. That placed significant obstacles to Intergraph's turning to an alternate supplier. In the years after the 1993 Comdex meeting, in which Mr. Meadlock recalls receiving Mr. Grove's assurances about Intel's open architecture, Intel began executing plans to move away from an open design in its newer chips to develop its own graphics functions. **********''They wanted to control more and more of the electronics,'' Mr. Meadlock said. ''They want the Compaqs and Dells of the world to be nothing more than their marketing arms.'' **********Unable to reach a settlement with Intergraph, Intel retaliated by withholding vital technical information and support, limiting Intergraph's  supply of chip samples, and according to Judge Nelson, blacklisting Intergraph in the digital media market by offering Intergraph customers financing and other support on the condition that those customers not deal with Intergraph. **********''What they've done to us is totally unethical and illegal,'' Mr. Meadlock said, ''and I don't think people realize it yet.'' **********Intel executives are expected to dispute the blacklisting charges and say there was nothing wrong with withholding chip technology from Intergraph, Compaq and Digital. The company's lawyers point out that even Mr. Meadlock has conceded that Mr. Grove never suggested that Intel would be Intergraph's ''perpetual supplier of chips.'' **********It all comes down, Intel executives say, to the countervailing rights of business partners. **********''At the end of the day, the facts in the three instances are similar,''  said Peter N. Detkin, an assistant general counsel at Intel who is overseeing its defense in the F.T.C. proceeding, said of the Intergraph, Compaq and Digital disputes. ''A customer of Intel asserted an intellectual property claim, claimed that it was entitled to a larger part of Intel's profits and decided to withhold patents from Intel. In response, we said we have intellectual property rights of our own and asserted them.''"

Revenue rose 18 percent, to $2.1 billion, from $1.8 billion in the period a year earlier. **********The results, which matched the average estimate of 5 cents a share forecast by 14 analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation, come as Monsanto tries to pay for seed companies it acquired to distribute its genetic technology. **********The company said it would cut about 1,700 jobs in 1999, up from an earlier forecast of 1,000 jobs. **********Monsanto has just begun shipping its new Celebrex arthritis drug, a potential blockbuster, and is moving six new drugs through advanced clinical trials. It is also working to integrate $6 billion in seed-company acquisitions. The company had hoped these projects would be financed by merging with the American Home Products Corporation.

Its far larger domestic rival, Elf Aquitaine, was mainly a Government fief run by bureaucrats. **********Mr. Desmarest, now the chairman at 53, mused in a recent conversation that it would be ''difficult to imagine'' Total contemplating a merger with Elf back then. **********Today both companies are publicly owned, and about 65 percent of Total's shareholders and 51 percent of Elf's are not French. Earlier this year, Total took the brash step of merging with the big Belgian group Petrofina to become Total Fina and is now locked in a brawl to acquire Elf Aquitaine. If Mr. Desmarest succeeds, and he is convinced he will by the end of the year, the combined Elf and Total Fina will still be only half the size of new giants taking shape, like the Mobil-Exxon combination, but it will dwarf many European rivals. **********''Things can change rapidly,'' Mr. Desmarest said, seated in his office here with a view of Elf's black glass headquarters tower. **********Indeed, in the last two years, France has moved to shake up and slim down its corporate world more thoroughly and quickly than many had thought possible. And in the process, it is simultaneously creating a kind of fortress within Europe even as it reaches aggressively beyond its borders into the global economy. **********France has gone through periods of wrenching restructuring in the past. In the 1980's, heavy industries like steel and coal, as well as financial services like insurance, were reorganized, and tens of thousands of jobs were shed. **********But while those changes, which were aimed at overcoming a chronic bloat that was smothering the economy, required France to go through a decade of pain, there are tentative signs that the latest wave of overhauling will produce a much faster payoff. **********France has become a darling of foreign investors, and the Paris bourse has surged by 50 percent in two years, against an average of 44 percent for the top 300 European companies. **********Growth prospects are brighter than in a long time. This year, the economy is expected to grow 2.5 percent, and though that is less than last year's 3.3 percent because of the downturn in emerging markets, the Government expects as much as 3 percent in 2000. Last year's growth produced a windfall of tax revenues, which were $6 billion higher than anticipated in this year's first half, prompting discussion of possible tax relief. **********There is even some relief on the job front. Though unemployment, at 11.5 percent, remains stubbornly high, in this year's second quarter private-sector jobs rose by 266,000, or nearly 2 percent, over 1998. The feeling, however tenuous, that things are getting better has helped transform the gloom that shrouded France in the mid-1990's into a new consumer confidence. **********And there is little sign that the corporate reshuffling will let up soon. **********In banking, an unsuccessful $37 billion hostile bid by Banque Nationale de Paris for two domestic rivals, Societe Generale and Paribas, ended with the takeover of Paribas, a strong investment bank, by the far larger Banque Nationale, creating what will be the third-largest bank in Europe after Deutsche Bank, the German banking giant, and UBS of Switzerland. The takeover will reshape the banking landscape in ways that could favor future consolidation beyond France. **********Emboldened by the changes, French corporations are entering new and inventive alliances. **********Earlier this month, the big aluminum group Pechiney joined Alcan of Canada and Alusuisse Lonza of Switzerland to form a behemoth to challenge the pre-eminence of Alcoa. **********Earlier, the chemical giant Rhone-Poulenc agreed to a $23 billion merger of its drug operations with those of Hoechst in Germany. **********And as French companies reorganize, they are flexing their muscles abroad. Americans were struck in recent months by the struggle of two French giants, Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, for control of the growing American market for water services. In March, Vivendi, once a stodgy utility called Generale des Eaux, made the biggest French acquisition ever in the United States when it paid almost $8 billion for the United States Filter Corporation. Not to be outdone, Lyonnaise des Eaux has spent more than $6 billion on similar acquisitions. **********''There's no other way but to follow the rules of the game as it's played now,'' said Eric Barthalon, chief economist at Paribas. Change is much in evidence at Paribas itself after the takeover by Banque Nationale. Yet Mr. Barthalon senses spirits rising. **********In 1997, when he returned to Paris after spending two years at Paribas's offices in London, ''it was a nightmare,'' he recalled. Paris was crushed by gloom, particularly among the young, who felt little chance of upward mobility. Talented graduates emigrated to Britain or the United States, finding work in Silicon Valley or at London brokerage firms. ''This has pretty much changed over the last two years,'' he said. ''Good people don't have to go abroad for jobs.'' **********Partly, the shake-up is the work of a new type of French-bred corporate raider. Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has consolidated the fashion and perfume businesses. Earlier this year, the billionaire Francois Pinault bought a large stake in Gucci, the Italian fashion group, in hopes of creating a rival luxury goods conglomerate. **********More often, graduates of the elite French training schools are learning to play by the new rules. **********Claude Bebear, chairman of the big AXA insurance group, got a degree from the Ecole Polytechnique. But with results below those that would have qualified him for top Government jobs, Mr. Bebear went to work at a sleepy insurance company in Normandy. In the past, he  would never have made it to the top of French society. But Mr. Bebear, now 63, had a strong sense of opportunity, picking up acquisitions at opportune moments. The turning point in his career came in 1991, when AXA paid $1 billion for a majority stake in the Equitable Insurance Company. Today, AXA's stake is worth 15 times that. **********In 1996, Mr. Bebear went further, acquiring Union des Assurances de Paris, a big French insurer the Government had sold off two years earlier. But Mr. Bebear's real influence  comes from AXA's role as one of France's, and the world's, largest asset managers. AXA is the biggest shareholder in Elf Aquitaine and owns substantial shares of Banque Nationale and Paribas. ''He is a fabulous manager, but he has a vision,'' said Elie Cohen, a leading French economist. He added that Mr. Bebear, who is an avid big-game hunter, brings the same instinct to his business decision-making. ''He knows that if you have to kill, you have to kill immediately.'' **********Consolidation is also being driven by the Government's push the last two years to sell big shares of more than a score of huge enterprises, including banks, industrial companies, and insurance. Though the state still holds large stakes in companies like Renault, Air France and France Telecom, the Government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, despite its Socialist heritage, has sold assets worth more than $30 billion to private shareholders. Many of these assets have gone to British and American investment funds, which become involved with the way the businesses are run, demanding good returns on investment and sound long-term strategies. **********Total was one of the pioneers. In 1991, the company listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, starting a flood of investment from institutional investors. **********And the trend toward an international shareholder base continues. The arrival of the euro is encouraging European investors to diversify geographically. ''What strikes me much more now,'' Mr. Desmarest said, ''is the arrival in the last year of new shareholders from Germany, the Netherlands.'' **********But if the private sector is getting back into shape, overstaffed Government operations pose even greater challenges for Mr. Jospin. Government spending, much of it on railways, postal service and medical care, account for 54 percent of the economy, against 40 percent in Britain. More than 25 percent of the workers in France are employed by government compared with 14 percent in Britain. **********To reduce unemployment, the Government has resorted to an immensely costly make-work program that created 174,000 jobs. **********Mr. Jospin's immediate challenge, advisers say, is getting a handle on pensions and health spending. With more than two years before national elections, Mr. Jospin wants to start debate on reducing the gap between Government pensions, which reach as much as 85 percent of final salary, and those in private business, where they are about 50 percent. To cut medical costs, the Government wants to consolidate the public hospital system. **********Despite union resistance to changes in the traditional public sector, labor leaders support Mr. Jospin in his bid to speed financial and industrial privatization. **********Jean-Christophe Le Duigou of the executive board of the C.G.T., the big labor federation that grew out of the Communist labor movement, accepts the Government's retreat from the business of running businesses, arguing that the public sector had ''reached its limits both industrially and financially.'' **********And he acknowledges that the private sector is creating jobs, even if many of them are considered temporary or part-time employment. Last year, hours lost through private-sector strikes were the fewest ever in postwar France. What his union now wants is for the Government to help by improving education and pouring more state money into industrial research. Fingering a cellular phone on his desk, he asks, ''Why should this be made by Nokia or Motorola -- not in France?'' **********His union is conciliatory in part because Mr. Jospin delivered on a pledge to enact legislation cutting the workweek from 39 hours, to 35. The idea, based on a popular notion of the labor market as a pie of fixed size, is that if the slices are cut smaller, there are more slices for everyone. **********Mr. Le Duigou acknowledges that the 35-hour week has not automatically created jobs. Still, he says, the new law is delivering benefits because it forces labor, business, and the Government to sit together and discuss ways to ease the dislocation caused by corporate restructuring. **********Business grudgingly swallowed the 35-hour week, negotiating in exchange a union commitment to more flexibility. In exchange for fewer hours, business won the right to more overtime, weekend and night work, increasing the productivity of factories that operate on high-  and low-production cycles, and can now run nonstop in periods of high demand. **********Total Fina is an example. The 35-hour week, Mr. Desmarest says, means the company ''will try to achieve a level of productivity gains to compensate'' for lost hours. Total Fina should benefit from greater flexibility at its robot division; the unit supplies the auto industry, which has seasonal and cyclical demand. **********Still, Mr. Desmarest added, he would have preferred a different approach. ''At the end of the day,'' he said, ''I am not at all convinced this will create jobs.''"

Now the National Institute of Standards and Technology is using this method to choose a new encryption standard to protect credit card numbers, personal data and other secrets as they travel over the Internet. **********Teams of code makers are not only submitting new standards but also trying to break the codes of other teams. The winner, to be picked by the institute next year, will be knighted as the ''advanced encryption standard'' and embraced by Government computers. The private sector should eventually follow. **********Fifteen teams of code makers entered the competition last year and immediately set out trying to unravel their rivals' efforts. Several promising entries have already been shredded by rival mathematicians, and contestants are whispering about whose codes will be next to fall. What is at stake is fame rather than fortune because the institute requires the winner to forgo any royalties. **********The last time the National Institute of Standards and Technology held such a contest was in the mid-70's. I.B.M. submitted the winning entry then, only to discover that the National Security Agency considered its new code to be so good that the design plan had to be classified. That code received the name data encryption standard, or D.E.S. Now D.E.S. is considered obsolete, especially since a code-breaking computer has been shown to be able to crack a typical message in one to three days. **********The National Security Agency's involvement raised suspicions at the time that the agency had secretly inserted a trapdoor (a piece of code that would give the agency surreptitious access to encrypted material) into D.E.S. to aid its eavesdropping, but no trapdoor has ever been found. **********This time, the standards institute is trying to counter paranoia, which is an occupational hazard of code-makers and code-breakers. The institute is actively encouraging public comments, and all the competitors have circulated long descriptions of their entries for public scrutiny. **********The United States is also courting European teams, in part because digital commerce is in a global arena and widespread adoption of the new standard will be a key to its success. One of the three major conference shootouts was held in Rome last spring. **********In August, the standards institute selected five encryption algorithms -- math-based systems -- as finalists. The finalists have names that range from the arcane, Twofish, to the traditional, RC-6; they include one planet, Mars; one animal name, Serpent, and one Scandinavian name, Rijndael. **********The institute chose the finalists after considering the speed, adaptability and security of the entrants. **********The competition will grow more intense as the teams prepare for a final conference in March. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will choose the winner next summer. Bruce Schneier, the lead designer of Twofish and the president of Counterpane Systems, a software company based in Minneapolis, said: ''This fall the Twofish team is having a one-week retreat. We're going to analyze ciphers. We're going to try to break these things.'' **********None of the finalists have any glaring weaknesses, which means that the teams are also trying to one-up each other by comparing their proposals' efficiency and adaptability. Speed is obviously important, but so is the ability to run well on many different classes of computers. The original call for submissions emphasized desktop computers, but many of the teams are now concerned about designing the codes to run well on relatively slow smart cards, plastic cards with embedded chips that are used as debit or telephone cards or for entry into buildings. **********Ross Anderson, a lecturer at Cambridge University who is one of the designers of Serpent, said: ''N.I.S.T. asked us to design our algorithms for Pentium processors, while the next century is likely to be dominated by 64 bits on the desktop, 8 bits in smart cards, with some 16 and 32 bits in mid-range embedded stuff. Some of us saw to it that our algorithms would also run O.K. on low-end processors; others did not.'' **********Comparing encryption codes is much closer to judging a figure skating competition than a track meet because there are no good techniques for proving that one code is definitively stronger than another. Breaking a code is clear proof that a code isn't strong. But you cannot prove a negative, that a given code cannot be broken. **********The designers are a bit vexed by recent work showing that the codes can be broken by tracking, in minute detail, the amount of power consumed by a smart card running a code. None of the people on the teams that are finalists have any great solution for thwarting this type of attack. Many are handing off the problem to hardware designers, asking them to find a way to make smart cards more opaque to determined attackers with power measurement tools. **********Ron Rivest, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is the main designer of RC-6, said there was no easy mathematical way to defend against  power consumption snoopers. ''These issues are very important, but they seem to hit the algorithms uniformly,'' he said. The best solution may be to choose the best tamperproof hardware, he added. **********The job of selecting the winner will fall on the shoulders of the standards institute's team of computer scientists studying system security. The acting chief of the computer security laboratory at the institute, Miles Smid, said that the institute might want to select two winners so if one failed, there would still be a backup."

Steam locomotives, those living, breathing behemoths, disappeared from the mainlines in the 1950's, replaced by efficient diesels with colorful corporate paint schemes but no soul. **********Then, one by one, the great railroads that laid a spider web of steel across North America in the 19th century fell by the trackside, victims of bankruptcies, mergers and consolidations. Conrail and Amtrak, for example, picked over the carcasses of the New York Central, Pennsylvania, Reading and other Eastern companies, salvaging freight and passenger operations that looked profitable and abandoning the rest. **********Only one famous line has managed to retain its historic identity: the Union Pacific, perhaps the greatest railroad of all. It is the Union Pacific and the long-ago Central Pacific Railroad that are the stars of Trans-Con, a computer game from the toy-train maker Lionel and Knowledge Adventure. Trans-Con takes players back to a time when railroading was a grand adventure and there was a thrilling race to lay track across the wild western half of the United States, linking the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the young nation. **********Trans-Con puts you in charge of building either the westward Union Pacific or the eastward Central Pacific segment of the 1,776-mile transcontinental railroad, overcoming assorted obstacles to be the first to reach an arranged meeting point at Promontory, Utah, while foiling saboteurs and saving the golden spike from outlaws. **********The game, the centennial version of which is packaged in a decorative tin box with an informative foldout map of the route and a tiny model of a wood-burning 1860's locomotive, is fun, educational -- and nonviolent. **********The graphics and sound effects are entertaining, and Lionel hopes the game will interest computer-wise children in leaving their keyboards for a while to play with scaled-down trains that also come packed with high-tech electronics like realistic digital sounds and remote control. Grown-ups who already have their toy railroads will also find Trans-Con a challenge, especially if they click the Hard button. **********Construction of the transcontinental railroad, which began in January 1863 and ended with the driving of the golden spike at Promontory on May 10, 1869, was an amazing engineering feat for the time. **********The Central Pacific had the shortest route -- 690 miles -- and a three-year head start because its rival was delayed by financial and engineering problems. But it needed the extra time since Central Pacific workers faced the formidable task of laying track over the Sierra Nevada. Much of the Union Pacific's 1,086-mile section crossed gently rolling plains. **********In either case, you will have the help of two young, more or less fictional characters -- a 25-year-old inventor and chief engineer, Jack Casement (beginning in 1866, the Union Pacific construction was supervised by a Civil War general named John S. Casement), and his 16-year-old sister, Sarah. She is adept at foiling the mischief-makers and unmasking the mastermind (perhaps the shipping mogul Cornelius Vanderbilt or the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis) who is determined to stop the construction. **********Context-sensitive help is available with a single click at any time, as is a Train of Thought Journal with page after page of accurate, easy-to-digest information on topics like railroad engineering, geography, wild animals, natural disasters and characters straight out of the history books. For instance, the Union Pacific's president, Thomas C. Durant, is described as ''a shady fellow who uses the money granted by the government to pay for a grand lifestyle.'' **********A ''money meter'' shows you how much is available for each stretch of track. Spend too much by making bad decisions or experiencing bad luck and your railroad will go bankrupt. Then you will have to start the section over. The first obstacle west of Omaha is the Elkhorn River, and you can choose one of three kinds of bridges to cross it: a deck plate ($10,000), a wood trestle ($25,000) or an iron trestle ($50,000). Go with the cheapest option and it will be washed away in a huge storm. It is also a really good idea to reroute the track to bypass a Pawnee village's crop fields and to keep a reserve for losses from a raging prairie fire or to find a way through an unexpected quicksand maze. **********I have just passed present-day Grand Island, Neb., where Union Pacific workers encountered Indians for the first time. I figure I will reach the virtual Promontory by New Year's Day, if I manage to build a 126-foot-high, 700-foot-long bridge near Laramie, Wyo., and find enough timber for rails on the nearly treeless plains. **********As for the Central Pacific, the ''steam-powered map'' in Jack Casement's rolling office shows that it has been built only part way to the summit near Truckee, Calif., where it will take a year to complete a 1,659-foot tunnel. I'm betting we'll win, even though the real race was essentially a tie."

But while the British and Chinese leaders conducted their exercise there with icy formality, the leaders here today seemed much more at ease. **********In a speech moments after the handover, President Jiang Zemin of China praised the smooth transfer. ''The friendship between the two peoples and the amicable cooperation between the two countries will develop from a new starting point,'' he said. **********Mr. Jiang also said the successful return of Macao -- following that of Hong Kong -- demonstrates that China is ''confident and capable'' of an early reunification with Taiwan. **********President Jorge Sampaio of Portugal greeted Mr. Jiang warmly on the dais and chatted amiably with him just before parting. But he reminded China that Portugal will remain committed to a Macao where, he said, ''democracy and freedom are an irreplaceable reality.'' **********At noon today, the first contingent of 700 troops from the Chinese Army rolled across the border in trucks and armored personnel carriers. China's deployment of soldiers here had been a bone of contention with Portugal in recent months. But today thousands of people -- many in red track suits -- lined the streets to welcome the troops, cheering and waving Chinese flags. **********Despite the clash on troops, Portugal negotiated guarantees of relative autonomy for Macao similar to those that Britain won for Hong Kong. But high-flown discussions of democracy and the rule of law seem less relevant in this tiny enclave of 430,000 people, where the main business is gambling and the biggest local concern is curbing Chinese gangs, whose violent battles stained the last days of the Portuguese administration. **********In Macao's casinos, a smaller than usual crowd wagered through the handover without a pause. A young man playing Chinese dominoes in the casino at the Hotel Lisboa glanced at a clock and prayed for good fortune at midnight. He won the next hand. **********Macao's carefully planned day got off to a chaotic start when the police broke up a gathering of members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement in front of the Lisboa. The police detained 40 of the group's members as they did their morning exercises, dragging some away by force. Falun Gong has been outlawed in mainland China, where the government has condemned it as an evil cult. **********Macao's authorities had warned the group not to protest here. Today, members assembled in a traffic circle, hoping to confront Mr. Jiang, whose motorcade was scheduled to pass by later in the morning. **********China may also have been put off by two of the most notable guests at the ceremony. Christopher Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, was there as a guest of the Portuguese, despite being reviled by Beijing for his strenuous advocacy of democracy in the years before the Hong Kong handover. Portugal also invited Jose Alexandre Gusmao, a top leader of newly independent East Timor. China maintains relations with Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975 and jailed Mr. Gusmao for his pro-independence activities until earlier this year. **********The transfer of sovereignty capped a day laden with symbolism, as Portugal gently reasserted its legacy in Macao one last time. At a morning Mass in the Macao cathedral, worshipers presented as an offering a bound copy of the Basic Law, the constitution negotiated between Portugal and China, which allows Macao to keep its own government and laws as a special region of China. **********''This was the offer given to us by the Chinese,'' said the Rev. Luis M. F. Sequeira, a Jesuit priest and one of the celebrants of the Mass. ''It is a challenge for them to uphold it.'' **********Portugal's formal renunciation of control began in the afternoon, as senior officials of the colonial administration gathered in the courtyard of the Government Palace to lower the Portuguese flag. The governor, Gen. Vasco Rocha Vieira, emerged from the salmon pink building at 5 p.m. to polite applause from a crowd, mostly Chinese, outside the gates. **********After the governor took his place next to an honor guard of police officers and firefighters in dress uniforms, a marching band struck up the Portuguese anthem and an officer slowly lowered the old green and red flag from its place on the peaked roof. He presented it to General Vieira, who placed it over his heart and gazed at a coat of arms above the entrance. **********The governor then strode through the gate, his expression stoic as he and his wife climbed into a limousine and were driven away. When the motorcade had gone, the crowd pushed past police officers and spilled gleefully into the courtyard. **********''Let's go in and take a look,'' said one man to his wife, as they made for the front steps, where a lone guard stood somewhat nervously behind the glass doors. After a few giddy moments, the police cleared out the courtyard and the palace stood empty in the gathering dusk, soft lights illuminating its white columns. **********Away from the rituals, the atmosphere on this handover day was festive, despite brisk weather and blustery winds that forced the cancellation of evening fireworks. Christmas bells and Chinese lanterns swung from lampposts in Largo de Senado, the picturesque brick square in the historic center of Macao. **********''I am proud because China is becoming bigger and more powerful,'' said Cheong Iom Wang, who arrived here from Cambodia as a refugee in 1970. Mr. Cheong, 37, said he would not miss the departing Portuguese. ''They've been here for a long time,'' he said. ''Their time is up.'' **********Even the Portuguese seemed determined to savor their last day of occupancy here. Many people traveled from Portugal on package tours to witness the handover. They strolled through the streets, their hats and fur coats a contrast to the more casual Chinese. **********''I came to see the end of a long period in our country's history,'' said Isabel Roque Cunha, who is from Aveiro, in central Portugal. Mrs. Roque Cunha, 56, said she had never been to Macao, though she had vivid images from pictures as a child. ''I expected it to be more grand,'' she said. **********There was no such ambivalence at a Buddhist temple in the old Chinese quarter of Macao, where people went to worship on this auspicious occasion. The temple, dedicated to the Chinese goddess A-Ma, is where Portuguese seafarers first made landfall in 1557. Today, people hung lines of firecrackers from a pole next to the entrance and set them off in a cacophonous celebration."

Its most prominent figures are Roland Dumas, the country's fifth-ranking official, and a former mistress, who was a lobbyist for France's biggest oil company. **********Details like the $2,000 pair of handmade shoes by Berluti that the lobbyist, Christine Deviers-Joncour, says she bought for Mr. Dumas, and her best-selling book, ''The Whore of the Republic,'' have created the impression that the scandal is mainly about  the money Mrs. Deviers-Joncour says she received from her company to influence Mr. Dumas when he was Foreign Minister. **********But the real scandal, according to the current president of the oil company, Elf Aquitaine S.A., is the way a small team of executives bilked the world's eighth-largest oil-producing company of at least $259 million between 1989 and 1993, when it was still Government-owned. **********''The final figure will probably be much higher,'' said Philippe S. Jaffre, Elf's president, at a lunch with American and British reporters. ''It may be impossible to determine the total.'' **********Mr. Jaffre said about 10 employees used secret foreign bank accounts, phony go-betweens, kickbacks and dummy real-estate firms to hide what they were doing. **********''Whenever Elf made a big acquisition or an investment in this period you find a middleman who sent a bill for a percentage commission, which was paid to an offshore account,'' he said. ''Then the middleman returned most of the money to the person behind the fraud. It was classic, textbook embezzlement.'' **********At the time, the company was run by Loik Le Floch-Prigent, who was jailed for six months for questioning by investigating judges last year. Mr. Jaffre succeeded Mr. Le Floch-Prigent, 55 and a close associate of the late Socialist President, Francois  Mitterrand, as Elf's president after a conservative Government came to power in 1993 and privatized the company the following year. **********The silver-haired Mr. Dumas, 76, another intimate whom Mr. Mitterrand made France's chief diplomat from 1988 to 1993, has denied any wrongdoing. While the investigation continues, he has also rejected calls to step down from his current post as President of the Constitutional Council, France's highest administrative tribunal. He has not disputed the fact of a relationship with Mrs. Deviers-Joncour. **********French investigative judges have traced more than $170 million of company funds to numerous secret bank accounts set up in Switzerland, Luxembourg and other countries by the alleged mastermind of Elf Aquitaine's secret deals, Alfred Sirven, 71 and a fugitive, and other close aides of Mr. Le Floch-Prigent. **********On Jan. 27, two judges, Eva Joly and Laurence Vichnievsky, gave lawyers for Mr. Dumas, Mrs. Deviers-Joncour, Mr. Le Floch-Prigent and four other former Elf Aquitaine employees 20 days to make any final points before the judges turn over the results of their investigation to other judicial authorities, who will decide whether to issue indictments and order trials. **********If crimes were committed, Elf Aquitaine was the biggest victim, Mr. Jaffre said. **********Mrs. Deviers-Joncour, 20 years younger than Mr. Dumas and who by her own account did little for the company's ousted executive team except try to keep Elf in his good graces, was also imprisoned from Nov. 7, 1997, to April 9 of last year, while the two judges investigated her activities. **********In her book, she wrote that she received $7.75 million from Mr. Sirven, who investigators say was Mr. Le Floch-Prigent's right-hand man, to keep quiet about some of what she knew. But, she said, he demanded and got the money back in cash in 1997. **********Company officials now say she got $10.3 million altogether, plus a salary of over $100,000 a year and free accommodation in a sumptuous luxury apartment on the fashionable Left Bank while she worked for Elf between 1989 and 1993. **********Mr. Sirven left Elf Aquitaine in 1993, and moved to Switzerland. He disappeared from sight there in 1997 and his present whereabouts are unknown. The investigative magistrates took until this year to issue effective international warrants for his arrest. **********According to Mrs. Deviers-Joncour, it was Mr. Sirven who, apparently in 1989, ordered her to try to get Mr. Dumas to drop his objections to the $2.7 billion sale to Taiwan of six frigates being built by Thomson-CSF, which was also state-owned at the time. **********She wrote that Mr. Dumas rejected all her attempts to influence him on the proposed sale, but, motivated by the prospect of a $7.75 million commission Mr. Sirven dangled before her, she kept pestering the Foreign Minister. **********The sale finally went through in 1991, but both Mrs. Deviers-Joncour and Mr. Dumas have told investigators that the decision was made not by the Foreign Minister but by Mr. Mitterrand, who concluded that Mr. Dumas's fears that French relations with China would be harmed were not justified. **********The judges have been trying to determine whether Mr. Dumas received any money from Mrs. Deviers-Joncour in return for decisions favorable to Elf while he was Foreign Minister. **********Though he has explained $461,000 in cash bank deposits during that time as payments for past legal services or proceeds from the sale of art works, Mr. Dumas has publicly stated that he never received a centime from Mrs. Deviers-Joncour. **********In her book, she wrote that the Dumas case surfaced after Thomson-CSF balked at paying a $28 million commission on the sale of the frigates. The money was to go to Edmond Kwan, a Hong Kong middleman engaged by Mr. Sirven. **********Mr. Kwan sued in Geneva, and when Mrs. Deviers-Joncour said she would go there to testify against the middleman to keep Mr. Dumas's name out of the newspapers, Mr. Sirven, she said, paid her the promised commission -- ''hoping to shut me up,'' she wrote. **********Mr. Kwan swore in an affidavit that his cut in the deal was to be a mere $2 million; the remaining $26 million, investigators have suggested, was to have been returned to Mr. Sirven as a kickback. **********The case has hardened an old view in France that Elf Aquitaine and other state-owned French companies were used for decades like giant slush funds by successive French Governments and political leaders who appointed compliant cronies to run them. **********Investigators reportedly found that Mr. Le Floch-Prigent personally approved many such arrangements but are not known to have traced any of the surreptitious bank accounts to him directly. **********''Elf did have the reputation of being a slush fund for the state, it's true,'' Mr. Jaffre, Elf's current chief said, ''but it's undeserved. And just because it may have happened in the past doesn't mean that employees were justified in helping themselves.''"

Even so, he has some other numbers that are hard to ignore. He drinks one bottle or so of wine each week and has 28,000 of them in his cellar. **********That helps explain why 3,400 of those bottles, including some of the rarest wines in the world, will be sold this week at Christie's in New York. Christie's is billing the auction, to be held on Thursday and Friday, as the ''millennium sale.'' **********''The best and rarest wines of the last 100 years to enjoy over the next 100 years,'' said Christopher Burr, head of Christie's wine department. The sale will include parts of other major collections, but the Koch wines, to be sold on Friday, are the stars. They include a bottle of Chateau Latour 1870, valued at about $6,000, among other Bordeaux from prized vintages including 1899, 1918, 1926, 1945 and 1961. **********Mr. Koch (pronounced coke) said soaring prices and his wine's mortality, but not his own, were major considerations in deciding to sell some of his collection. ''Christie's had been after me for a long time,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in Boca Raton, Fla. ''Also, the market prices are good right now and, well, it seemed like a good opportunity to prune my cellar. **********''I went through my inventory looking particularly at ones I had the most of and ones that are at or about to pass their peak.  I've got a lot of old wines,'' he said, in pointed understatement. He keeps his collection in two temperature- and humidity-controlled cellars in his summer home at Osterville, Mass., on Cape Cod. ''One is for new wines,'' he said, ''and the other, fancier one, is to show off to my friends.'' **********William I. Koch is known in business as a maverick member of the Wichita, Kan., family that owns Koch Industries, an oil, chemical and agricultural giant that is one of the largest private companies in the country. He has spent much of the last two decades in court, battling with his brothers over the disposition of the family's multibillion-dollar fortune. A prominent yachtsman, he won the 1992 America's Cup race for the San Diego Yacht Club. He is also a major art collector, owning works by Renoir, Picasso, Monet and Cezanne. **********Despite his formidable wine collection, Mr. Koch does not consider himself much of an expert. In buying wine, he said: ''I taste and decide. I don't go into it much beyond that. I buy all the wine books, but I don't necessarily read them.'' **********Not to be outdone, Christie's archrival, Sotheby's, is holding a sale later this month featuring what it calls the ''millennium superlot,'' a consignment of 17 cases of rare Bordeaux, Burgundies and Champagnes, which Sotheby's predicts will sell for as much as $250,000. The millennium superlot is from the collection of George Zicarelli, an editor in New York for CBS News. **********Aside from the millennium hype, these auctions, while not the biggest or most important offered by either auction house in recent years, reflect an ever-growing demand for rare wines, both old and relatively new. Bottles from the 19th and early 20th centuries have always been in short supply, but the proliferation of collectors and knowledgeable drinkers has made good recent vintages hard to find, too. **********The best wines from highly praised vintages like 1982 and 1990 in Bordeaux, long  virtually sold out, are found only at auctions. Some of the most famous Burgundies -- like Le Montrachet, a white, and Romanee-Conti, a red -- are made in such small quantities that collectors snap them up as soon as they are released, at prices hovering near $1,000 a bottle. Wine buyers for top restaurants haunt the auction halls, paying astonishing prices for wines their customers demand. **********Much attention is paid to expensive wines at auctions, but bargains can be overlooked.  Both sales will offer lots of lesser-known but excellent older wines at estimated prices as low as $200. A case of 1988 Burgundy, Nuits-St.-Georges Clos de la Marechale, is estimated at $350 to $500, and two magnums, or double bottles, of Antinori Chianti Classico Riserva 1985, at $200 to $300. **********BUT for wine collectors, the chase is as important as the capture. Just as Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer, is building back a vast collection he has recently sold off, Mr. Koch readily acknowledged that he will eventually bring his collection back up to its pre-sale size. **********''It's been almost entirely French,'' he said, ''Bordeaux and Burgundy. Now I'd like to move into other things -- Argentina, perhaps; Chile, California, New Zealand. I'll probably get back to around 28,000 bottles.'' He spends so much on wine that he can bypass the usual retail channels and buy through agents around the world. **********At Christie's, the Thursday sale will feature wines from the extensive holdings of two Floridians who have been collecting for three decades: Kenneth M. Mazik, chairman of the Orlando Financial Corporation, and Dr. Robert Elkins, the founder and chief executive of Integrated Health Services, a nursing home and home health care provider. Both more than 6 feet tall, they are known in wine circles as ''the big guys.'' **********In putting wines up for sale, Dr. Elkins knows medical science has its limits. ''I took  a look at our list,'' he said, ''and I realized I'd be 120 years old before I drank it up.'' **********On The Block **********The Christie's auction begins at 2 P.M. Thursday and continues at 10 A.M. Friday at 20 Rockefeller Plaa in Manhattan. Catalogues and information are available by calling (212) 636-2000. The Sotheby's auction, at 1334 York Avenue, at 72nd Street, will be on May 22 in two sessions, at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. (Information (212) 774-5330). Christie's predicts that it's auctions will bring $2.5 Million; Sotheby's estimates $1.39 Million for its sale. Such estimates, however, tend to run low."

Governments have either been reluctant to share or potentially expose intelligence-gathering methods. **********Prosecutors have been gathering such classified evidence to indict President Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav high command.

There will be no hiding place.'' **********Mr. Cook has also been direct in addressing Mr. Milosevic on television. In a recent broadcast, he taunted Mr. Milosevic to go ahead and tell the Serbian people, who are deprived of many goods, about the villas the Yugoslav President keeps in Greece. **********Of the leading NATO countries, France until recently was the least cooperative with the tribunal, which was set up by the United Nations in 1993. On several occasions, France refused to let its military officers testify in The Hague, apparently to protect classified information. But the tribunal has pressed Paris, and  Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, the former commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, is now expected to testify soon. **********Prosecutors need the evidence to establish responsibility often spoken of by politicians who are under less constraint to prove their charges.  The prosecutor's office says it has gathered enough evidence of war crimes in Kosovo to indict lower-level police and officers. But the prosecutors want more details about orders within the Yugoslav command, which, if available, is likely to be classified intelligence. **********Even when the tribunal was given such intelligence in the past in connection with crimes during the war in Bosnia and Croatia, prosecutors say they have not been allowed to use that as evidence in the courtroom because governments do not want intelligence-gathering methods exposed. **********As refugees now tell of mass killings and abuse in Kosovo, investigators for the tribunal are obviously overwhelmed, tribunal officials say. They are assisted by dozens of specialists from other groups."

The combination of more people employed -- a hefty 234,000 more -- and more time on the job for everyone gave rise to forecasts that in the fourth quarter the economy would keep up its spectacular growth. **********''We were expecting the economy to slow more quickly, with the help of a stock market decline,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner in Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, which is forecasting an annual growth rate of nearly 5 percent, or almost as much as the 5.5 percent in the third quarter. ''But we are getting a revving up, not a slowing, and we are certainly not going through a stock market decline.'' **********Stock prices shot up yesterday, in reaction to two numbers in the report: the job growth and the average hourly wage for ordinary workers. That wage rose only 2 cents, to $13.41. The combination of healthy economic growth and modest wage gains suggests the likelihood of little inflationary pressure. **********That is an outlook that stock investors favor. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 247.12 points, or 2.24 percent, to 11,286.18 -- not far from the record close of 11,326.03 on Aug. 25. **********''If the wage growth had been a bit higher, the stock market would not have performed nearly as well,'' said Joshua N. Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management. **********Not everyone was as sanguine as stock investors about inflation. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent, matching the 30-year low hit in October, suggesting that labor shortages must eventually become inflationary, although there is no sign of that yet. **********Wage pressures are, however, showing up among higher-level people, whose incomes are more likely to be fattened by bonuses, profit sharing and cashing in stock options. These labor costs are captured in a broader but less publicized measure of pay called compensation per hour. It has risen at an annual rate of 4.8 percent since the second quarter. **********And unit labor costs -- the amount paid to workers to make a car, say, or dry-clean a suit -- have edged up. **********''We think there is a fair amount of pressure already developing on profits,'' Mr. Varvares said. **********Still, there seemed to be a widespread consensus among Wall Street economists that the Federal Reserve, which recently raised interest rates slightly, would refrain from any further increase this year, not seeing in the latest job numbers enough inflationary pressure. Indeed, the Labor Department report suggested that job growth, for all its current strength, was gradually declining, to 200,000 a month over the last three months from 230,000 a month over the last six months. **********The Clinton administration hailed the job report as a milestone. With the 234,000 new jobs in November, job creation during the president's nearly seven years in office passed the 20 million mark, reaching  20,043,000, an achievement that mainly reflects the strong economy but also the administration's economic policies, officials said. **********Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman called the achievement historic -- and indeed there has been no other seven-year period in which so many jobs have been created. **********But in percentage terms, the 20 million new jobs created since January 1993, bringing the total number of nonfarm jobs to 129.5 million last month, represented growth of 18 percent. In the long economic expansions of the 1960's and the 1980's, the work force expanded by greater percentage rates over seven years: 25 percent in the 60's and 22 percent in the 80's. **********''There were comparable periods of job growth that you can find in other recoveries,'' Henry Holzer, the Labor Department's chief economist, acknowledged, ''but we have reached lower levels of unemployment than in the 1980's.'' **********The administration also released a study that found that a great majority of the new jobs were in occupations that paid more than the national median wage of $13 an hour. But several labor economists noted that newly created jobs were almost always at the higher end of the pay scale, even during recessions, a point that Mr. Holzer also acknowledged. **********''It may not be any different than in the past,'' he said, ''but the perception is different; the perception is that the economy is not creating good jobs, and we are.'' **********The real issue is the distribution of pay over the work force, and here there has been an improvement since President Clinton took office in 1993, said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. The percentage of American workers earning less than $8 an hour, adjusted for inflation, has fallen from 30 percent to about 25. ''All of the improvement has come since 1996,'' Mr. Bernstein noted. **********Much of the November job growth came in the service sector, particularly in helping companies convert their computer systems for Year 2000 operation. But construction jobs also swelled, by 55,000, perhaps because of the mild November weather in much of the country. And workers everywhere put in longer hours; an index of hours worked rose 0.3 percent after rising 0.4 percent in October. **********Manufacturing employment, while still shrinking, is doing so much more slowly than in the first half, when the loss averaged 36,000 jobs a month. Since July this has fallen 9,000 a month, including only 2,000 in November. The gains reflect the strong demand for merchandise in a booming economy, as well as reviving demand abroad for American goods, analysts said. **********But there were also signs of weakness. Retail employment grew by only 1,000 jobs beyond what the Labor Department expected in the adjustment it makes to allow for the holiday demand for store clerks. **********''That might simply reflect the difficulty retailers are having in finding enough workers in this tight labor market,'' said Thomas Nardone, chief of the Division of Labor Force Statistics at the Bureau of Labor Statistics."

His seniority, impeccable credentials and continued access to the highest circles in China made him strategically important to Falun Gong, and equally threatening to the country's leaders. **********Today, the military newspaper, Liberation Army Daily, printed a question-and-answer interview with Mr. Li in which he offered a classic Communist Party-style confession as he endorsed the party's crackdown, the nation's most sweeping political campaign in a decade, **********''I felt I was cheated,'' Mr. Li said, according to the account. ''The party's decision is very wise, very correct and very prompt.'' **********In the secretive and shadow-prone way of Chinese politics, however, Mr. Li's former position and rank were not described in the article, which simply referred to him as an old cadre who had ''wrongly written an article propagating Falun Gong.'' **********To the casual reader, Mr. Li's long admission might look like just another item in the anti-Falun Gong propaganda that has swamped China's official media over the last week. **********But as Chinese insiders know, Mr. Li has been identified by Chinese authorities as Falun Gong's top officer in Beijing, and the article he wrote was a critical item in the Government's decision to mount such a wide-reaching political campaign against the movement. Falun Gong advocates an amalgam of traditional qigong breathing exercises and meditation, with elements of Buddhism and Taoism, to enhance spiritual and physical well-being. The Communist Party has mobilized its vast apparatus to demand that government offices and work places all over the nation purge Falun Gong members and swear allegiance to the party's Marxist ideology. **********Mr. Li's article was brought to the attention of President Jiang Zemin on May 5, 10 days after a huge demonstration by Falun Gong supporters outside China's leadership compound in central Beijing, said a Chinese political analyst with access to internal documents. **********In his article, which was circulated among senior military officers, Mr. Li wrote that China's leaders should look kindly on the spiritual movement. What is more, Mr. Li urged leaders to study Falun Gong personally to improve their own physical and mental health. **********Gen. Zhang Wannian, China's top military officer and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission under Mr. Jiang, sent a copy of the article to the President recommending that action be taken against Mr. Li. **********Mr. Jiang, who was deeply alarmed by the boldness of the challenge to his authority implicit in the April 25 demonstration, wrote a sharply worded memorandum to fellow Politburo members identifying Falun Gong as a serious threat to the Communist Party's existence. **********The memo was dated May 8, the day after NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, which caused such outrage here that most Chinese saw it as an affront to their national dignity. The authorities permitted students to hold anti-American demonstrations, which included throwing rocks at the United States Embassy in Beijing. **********If Falun Gong masters can foresee everything, Mr. Jiang wrote, how could they not predict the bombing of our embassy? **********At the same time, Mr. Jiang instructed Gen. Wang Ke, the director of the People's Liberation Army's General Logistics Department, to visit Mr. Li to help him see the party's position more clearly. **********Mr. Li apparently buckled right away. Yet his confession was only made public today. **********In the confession, Mr. Li made it clear that he will now oppose the teachings of Li Hongzhi, who founded Falun Gong in 1992 and now lives in New York City. The two Li's are not related. **********''When Li Hongzhi says that Falun Gong can cure all disease, that is a ridiculous position and must be a way to trick people,'' Mr. Li was quoted as saying. ''Seeking medical treatment when you are sick is common sense. If Falun Gong is really so powerful, why do we need doctors, why do we need hospitals?'' **********Mr. Li, a veteran of the Communist military forces' Long March in the mid-1930's, the defining political event of the party's founding generation of leaders, has apparently been permitted to stay at home, while many other Falun Gong leaders have been taken into custody. **********Although the organization of Falun Gong has remained mysterious, staffed by adherents who have gone to extreme lengths to protect what they believe is a sacred mission to propagate the teachings of Li Hongzhi, the crackdown is gradually disclosing clues about its structure. **********The official media have reported that under the central leadership of the Falun Dafa Research Society, there were 39 provincial-level ''general guidance stations'' and 1,900 lower-level ''guidance stations'' spread all over China. For ordinary practitioners, the authorities said, there were more than 28,000 practice sites, mostly in urban parks and public places. **********In recent days, the authorities have started producing confessions from the heads and deputy heads of ''general guidance stations'' in Jilin Province and Shandong Province. **********In a nationwide political campaign, Communist Party leaders in each province are expected to produce the confession of the chief local culprit, in this case Falun Gong leaders, so the number who are actually brought forward may provide the best indication of how well Beijing's campaign is going. **********One difficulty that Chinese leaders face is Falun Gong's amorphous nature, which makes it difficult to control. Another difficulty is the group's  home-grown nature, which makes it hard to cast as a foreign plot, a favorite tactic in identifying a political enemy and one that was used against the democracy movement of 1989 at Tiananmen Square. **********Yet Chinese officials have pointed to a foreign role in Falun Gong anyway, apparently because Li Hongzhi is based in the United States and because much of the Internet communication among the group's leaders has come from outside China. **********''Hostile Western forces are using 'Westernization' and 'separatist' strategies to constantly carry out ideological and cultural infiltration,''  the New China News Agency reported this week. **********A Hong Kong newspaper, Ming Pao, also reported that Mr. Jiang's memo specifically pointed to ''behind-the-scenes involvement of foreign forces'' in Falun Gong."

Pettit, the head of the Cable and Wireless global business operations, reiterated at a news conference today that the company had been in talks with some local carriers, although he did not specify which ones. Press reports here say that the company has approached the DDI Corporation and Tokyo Telecommunication Network, but those reports have been denied. **********Without such a link, Cable and Wireless faces high access charges, which will make it difficult for the company to make good on its promises to offer the best-quality service at the lowest cost. **********Cable and Wireless IDC, as the company will be known, intends to focus on building its business in Japan with large corporate customers interested in services such as automated teller machines and data and voice-over services, as well as on other telecommunications and Internet service providers looking for the most cost-efficient commodity services. **********Right now, International Digital's traffic is largely generated by individuals, and only a small portion of its business is in data transmission, according to Kate Lye, a telecommunications analyst at Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo. ''The IDC business is largely telephone revenues, which will come under heavy pricing pressure,'' she said. ''They'll need to diversify away from the dependence on voice traffic.'' **********Cable and Wireless won the support of all but seven of International Digital's 141 shareholders, garnering a 97.69 percent stake for roughly $460 million at current exchange rates, plus the assumption of $262 million in debt. The company declined to identify the holdouts, but people close to the situation said that Fujitsu Ltd., which holds roughly 1.6 percent of International Digital, and some newspaper companies did not tender their shares. **********Analysts say Cable and Wireless has paid a hefty price, and its executives have complained that the Itochu Corporation, a large trading company whose 17.7 percent stake in International Digital made it pivotal in the deal, drove a hard bargain. **********There are fears that former shareholders of International Digital like Itochu and the Toyota Motor Corporation, which were also its customers, might take their business elsewhere now that they have no stake in the company. **********But Mr. Pettit said Cable and Wireless IDC would offer them such high-quality, cost-competitive services that they couldn't afford to jump ship. ''No emotion comes into that at the end of the day,'' he said."

But there has been an abrupt shift in this view in recent months. **********After several exceptionally brutal crimes -- two men killed their wives and children and set their bodies on fire -- and new studies detailing the level of brutality in the schools, there has emerged an intense focus on violence among Israelis that has temporarily pushed aside the historic focus on conflict with the Arabs. **********''We have to deal with this exactly as we have dealt with terrorism,'' said Zeev Friedman, director of health, welfare and social services for the city of Tel Aviv, ''because this is nothing less than an internal form of terrorism.'' **********While there are no firm data showing a rise in violence, what has changed, many experts suspect, is Israel's sense of itself, its attitude toward such behavior. **********Since the fear of war is lower than it has ever been and Israel's links to the West, especially the United States, are closer than ever -- a result of cable television, computers, commerce and increased travel -- Israelis are less willing to excuse shortcomings in their society as byproducts of the need to survive. **********Others say the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 was a watershed, when suddenly it seemed that life had become cheap in Israel. **********Today's issue of the dominant daily newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, illustrates how widespread that view is. Although Israeli-Palestinian relations are tense over land-for-security arrangements, and the new Government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak seems to be getting ready to negotiate the return of the strategic Golan Heights to Syria, neither issue made the front page. **********The main article concerned the latest attack of a feared figure known as the Tel Aviv Rapist. A second article told of a paroled convict who visited his girlfriend and threw her baby daughter out a window. The dealings with the Arabs were relegated to inside pages. **********Since the focus on internal violent behavior is so recent, there are virtually no data to confirm the widely held view that violence in Israel, a nation of six million, is on the increase or that the increase is due partly to the arrival of so many people from the former Soviet Union in the last decade. **********Data for many forms of violence have been collected only for the last five years and show mixed trends. Spousal and school violence, two areas of particular focus in the press, have shown no increase in that time. The number of homicides declined from 79 in the first half of 1998 to 61 in the first half of 1999. **********''We are less involved today with security problems,'' noted Zemira Mevarech, chief scientist at the Education Ministry, who recently called for a comprehensive program, including rewards for teachers and staff, aimed at reducing school violence. ''As concerns over security go down, the focus on quality of life goes up.'' **********American influence is significant. When two Colorado students went on a shooting spree in their high school in April, killing 12 fellow students and a teacher, the story was big news for days here. Many commentators suggested that such a massacre could happen here, since a recent study showed that 7 percent of high school students carried weapons. **********Moreover, the latest hero in the Israeli press is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, whose name is invoked frequently by those who think that policing of minor and major crimes in Israel has been lax. **********Last month, an Israeli artist named Gil Mitchell was knifed to death after asking two men not to scrape his car with theirs. That prompted Haim Yavin, the state television's long-serving news anchor, to offer a rare Op-Ed article in the newspaper Haaretz and call on Israel's police to take a lesson from New York's. **********''A metropolis of crime, drugs and dirt has become one of the most flourishing cities in the world,'' Mr. Yavin wrote of New York. ''Mayor Giuliani's task has been to teach millions of New Yorkers to respect the rule of law.'' **********Israelis should take a lesson, he added: ''Today, Israel is more than a little similar to the New York of 20 years ago. Instead of the rule of law, we have the rule of the knife and the revolver.'' **********The idea that Israel is following an American path or should learn from the United States is in marked contrast to how this country saw itself two or three decades ago. Then, when Americans faced decaying cities, drug addiction and violent youth, most Israelis happily noted that their country was different. **********American problems were seen as a result of American societal conditions, including the lack of mutual concern and cohesion that characterized Israel in its early decades. **********Today, American-style problems and American-style solutions are seen as almost inevitable, since this country has come to resemble the United States more than ever. The economy, for example, once one of the world's most egalitarian, is now characterized by a huge gap between richest and poorest. **********The Police Ministry is trying to learn how police officers in the United States deal with domestic violence. It is widely suspected that since the Israeli police tended in the past to focus on external, meaning Arab, threats, they had little training and little interest in domestic crimes. **********A new program trains detectives in such work, and there will soon be a doubling of the 170 detectives assigned to such tasks. **********The Education Ministry is trying to devise an American-style curriculum that teaches pupils sensitivity toward one another and reduces violent confrontations. Tel Aviv is seeking help from Los Angeles on how to fight domestic abuse. **********But more Israeli-style approaches are also being contemplated. **********''Just like every Israeli has been trained over the years to report a suspicious package in the street in case it is a terrorist bomb, today Israelis need to learn to detect signs of domestic violence around them so that lives can be saved,'' suggested Mr. Friedman, the Tel Aviv director of social services. **********Yossi Harel of Bar-Ilan University, outside Tel Aviv, spent 11 years at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, where he was in charge of the youth survey system and helped plan surveys for some 30 countries on youth health and violence. **********The most recent study, for 1998, shows Israel eighth out of 28 countries on the question of what percentage of youths have been bullied at school. For Israel it was 50 percent. That was behind the United States, in 18th place with 34 percent. **********When Professor Harel published the results of the first such study in 1995 with similar results for Israel, he said, no one took it seriously. But when he published the 1998 results this year -- including the finding that more than half of the students in grades 6 through 10 were involved either as perpetrators or victims of violence -- the ground was fertile and his study became major news. **********''It took a long time to build awareness that we really have a problem on our hands in terms of the banality of violence as a part of daily life for Israeli youth,'' Professor Harel said. ''Kids here use verbal and physical violence to cope. My interpretation is that as a society and system we have failed to provide the youth of this country with alternative resources for coping with frustration and anger.'' **********He said violent attitudes were endemic throughout society -- on the roads, in Parliament, in public places, on television talk shows -- and the youth were drinking it all in. **********The problem is also difficult in the home. Malka Soffer, head of the crime victims section in Israel's national police, said that until the early 1990's, spousal and child abuse were treated by the police as occasions to mediate between offender and victim rather than act as law enforcement agents. **********Today there are special instructions, and domestic abuse is considered a crime of great urgency, she said. ''Today we think that if a violent crime is committed within the family, it is more severe than if it is committed among strangers, because of the risk of repetition,'' she said. **********Feminists have been raising concerns over spousal abuse here for several years. But many Israelis had trouble believing that Jewish husbands were really guilty of such activity. Accepting that such problems exist in Israel has been part of the country's maturation, some say. **********''There was this big myth that Jewish husbands wouldn't do this sort of thing,'' said Ronit Lev-Ari, director of the department of family violence prevention for Naamat, a women's group. ''But we are like everyone else. It may be very sad for some, but Israel is normal. **********''Like elsewhere, most Israeli husbands who beat their wives were themselves beaten as children and, like other societies, we need to learn to stop them and to treat them.''"

The officials said the market would remain flawed until tax loopholes were closed, yet they said the British were seeking to perpetuate a large loophole. Officials from several countries said that despite its declared aim of coming closer to Europe, Britain was being less cooperative than at any time since the government of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. **********The Finnish finance minister, Sauli Niinisto, said that the Finnish presidency of the EU would ""continue work with a view to finding ways of overcoming the main obstacle before or at"" the Helsinki summit meeting, and allow the EU to come to an agreement on a full tax package. He said attempts to find a solution would include an extraordinary meeting of finance ministers in Helsinki in parallel with the summit conference. **********But he acknowledged that the positions were far apart and that failure at Helsinki could mean an end to the tax package that has been in the works since December 1997. Governments regard the package, which also includes a code of conduct to close tax loopholes and avoid double taxation on inter-company transfers such as royalties, as an integrated whole. **********Mr. Niinisto said other questions in the package had to be resolved, including revenue sharing from a tax on savings and investment. **********But with no agreement on Eurobonds, he said, there could be no revenue to share. He said he was looking for new initiates to break the deadlock, but the British position limited the range of available options. Officials said that if any agreement is reached at Helsinki, it would likely be minimal. **********Mr. Brown, speaking during a meeting of EU finance ministers, insisted that Britain was ""winning the argument"" over Eurobonds. In fact, 13 other EU members were highly critical of the British position, while a 14th, Luxembourg, sought to defend its advantages as a secretive banking haven. **********The British and the Luxembourgers in effect reinforced one another, since Mr. Brown cited banking secrecy in other countries as a reason for not going along with an alternative proposal that would allow countries to report investment income to the home countries of the investors, rather than taxing it directly at source. **********Either way, the aim was to close a loophole that enables millions of Europeans to avoid taxes by putting their money in foreign accounts. They are, of course, supposed to report any profits, but the assumption is that most do not, depriving national tax authorities of uncounted revenues. **********The only hope of saving the tax package appeared to be a political compromise at European summit meeting in Helsinki at the end of next week, but Mr. Brown asserted that the British position would not change โ leaving open the possibility that Prime Minister Tony Blair may have to exercise a national veto if other countries insist on pressing the issue. Mr. Brown appeared to contradict himself by saying that on the one hand Britain was willing to accept a reporting system, and on the other stating that one of his principle objections was an increase of red tape. **********Officials from other governments said Britain was confusing the issue by trying to give the impression that the entire Eurobond market was at stake. In fact, the proposal was for a tax only on Eurobonds in private hands โ an estimated 3 percent to 5 percent of the total โ since institutional investors have to prepare income and tax statements and would not be affected. **********Other ministers argued that exempting the Eurobond market from the proposal to level a 20 percent tax on the profits of investments held by foreigners would create a massive loophole, because everyone would want to invest in them. This would have precisely the opposite effect of an operation intended to close loopholes. **********But Mr. Brown said he would not go along with proposals that he asserted would destroy jobs in London's financial markets and make not just Britain but Europe as a whole less competitive."

The delay could affect the auto maker's plans for similar plants in the United States and elsewhere. Ford has put on hold plans to build a plant for its ''Project Amazon,'' also intended to produce inexpensive small cars. **********Roughly 10,000 jobs related to the factories and more than $1 billion in investment are at stake as the two leading auto makers, already frustrated by a plunge in car sales as Brazil struggles with recession, seek an agreement with Olivio Dutra, the outspoken Workers Party governor of Rio Grande do Sul, an industrial state of 10 million. **********Mr. Dutra, who took office in January, suspended an accord that his predecessor had made with G.M. and Ford to provide the two companies with about $280 million of financing and infrastructure in exchange for their decision to build the factories near Porto Alegre, the state capital. **********One of the rising stars of the Workers Party, the main organized opposition to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's Government, Mr. Dutra contends that his state needs the money previously designated for the factories to finance programs in education, health care and housing. **********The president of G.M.'s Brazilian subsidiary, Frederick Henderson, said in an interview that ''there are certain things we need like gas, waste-water treatment, roads and electricity, to proceed.'' Without the Government's help in finishing these projects, the G.M. factory will not be ready to produce cars until mid-2000 -- about six months later than expected, Mr. Henderson said. **********The conflict between the car producers and Mr. Dutra is part of a wider argument, in which several Brazilian states have resorted to unorthodox measures to shore up their finances. Another Governor, Itamar Franco of Minas Gerais in central Brazil, declared a moratorium on his state's debt payments to the federal Government at the beginning of the year, a decision that contributed to a market panic and a currency crisis. **********Mr. Dutra also threatened default, but backed off after pressure from President Cardoso, and has since refocused his energy on G.M. and Ford. **********The Governor's conflict with the auto makers is complicating what until recently were plans for the two advanced factories, which have been closely followed by world car makers. G.M.'s Blue Macaw plant is designed to function as a ''factory condominium,'' as described by Mr. Henderson, in which 16 suppliers operate on the same site. G.M. has hoped to produce as many as 150,000 compact cars annually at the plant. **********At the nearby site for the Ford factory, where only the ground has been prepared for construction, suppliers are also expected to be more involved in production. The plant was scheduled to start production in 2001, with annual output of 150,000 cars. Since the factory is in such an early stage, representatives from the state government have said there is a possibility that Ford may switch the location to another state. Officials from Ford's Brazilian subsidiary declined to comment. **********Mr. Dutra has explained his actions by saying that the incentives granted by the previous Governor, Antonio Britto, were unrealistic, given Rio Grande do Sul's need to improve basic services. In addition, the state government faces a budget deficit of roughly $60 million a month."

The party is also a fierce populist defender of subsidies on staple foods. The subsidies were recently eliminated by the financially pressed Government, setting off riots last year. **********Officials who know Prince Abdullah expect him to agree to a request for a dialogue with the Islamist opposition. **********''His style is to pursue a policy of inclusion rather than a policy of exclusion,'' said Rima Khalaf, a former planning minister who worked closely with the Crown Prince on several projects in the past. ''That should determine the way he deals with the Muslim Brotherhood and other so-called opposition groups. He is a unifier by nature.'' **********But to accede to the Muslim Brotherhood demand for a dissolution of Parliament could be a risk not worth taking until Prince Abdullah has consolidated his own hold on power. The current Parliament will adjourn in March, and, as is customary here, is not scheduled to reconvene until October. ''That could buy Abdullah some time,'' said one politician, who insisted on anonymity. **********Prince Abdullah is universally expected to adhere scrupulously to constitutional procedures for any government personnel changes. ''The Constitution has been respected all through this ordeal, as you are all aware,'' Nasser Judeh, the Minister of Information, said this morning at a news conference. ''This is a country of solid institutions,'' Mr. Judeh said. ''This is a country of continuity.'' **********Yet even if broad policies and institutions are unlikely to change, there is general agreement that the new Government cannot simply continue with the current cast of political characters. ''The real question is when,'' said one former top official. **********The most sensitive immediate issue is the fate of senior officials who owe their positions to Prince Abdullah's uncle, Prince Hassan, who served as Crown Prince for 34 years and has especially great influence in the critical Foreign and Finance Ministries. **********If the new ruler is seen to be moving too quickly to replace Hassan loyalists it could be viewed as an unseemly vendetta. Yet a failure to install some of his own appointees might be misinterpreted as a sign of weakness, hampering Prince Abdullah's ability to rule, political experts said. **********The best early indicator of how the Crown Prince intends to handle this dilemma may be Mr. Judeh himself, the son-in-law of Prince Hassan. Mr. Judeh has been severely criticized for the paucity of state media coverage of the King's health and plans for the succession. Most Amman professionals say they have been following the events on foreign radio and cable television. **********Critics saw Mr. Judeh's news conference today as the most recent case in point. **********After summoning hundreds of foreign and Jordanian reporters to what was billed as the first public briefing on the King's health by the King's doctor, Mr. Judeh read a brief official opening statement and declined to answer questions about the King on the grounds that the doctor would be better equipped to respond. **********The Information Minister then departed, leaving an assistant to explain to reporters that the doctor would not address the reporters after all, but a bulletin would be distributed instead. Hours later, the bulletin had not appeared."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/16/business/oil-rigs-hanging-on-to-workers.html,Agis Salpukas,1999-02-16,"Practice by oil service companies, including Grey Wolf Drilling Co, Global Marine Inc and Rowan Companies, to hold on to some oil rig workers even when there is not enough work is significant departure for cyclical industry that is used to letting...",1077,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Oil Rigs Hanging On to Workers,Oil Rigs Hanging On to Workers," **********When Grey Wolf Drilling Company announced recently that it would lay off 1,700 workers, Freddy Garcia feared that his flush times in the oilfield might be over. **********His worries were well founded: job cuts have been widespread in the oil patch as crude oil prices tumble and rigs are shut down. In 10 years, Mr. Garcia, 35, had risen to the top of his field, supervising a crew of three workers and earning $13.50 an hour in shifts often 12 hours long. **********But to his surprise, Mr. Garcia was kept on the payroll, even though his crew had no work with its rig at the end of the year. The company transferred him to another rig that was still active. **********''I got a wife and kids,'' he said. ''I want to pay my house off. When they call, I tell my wife, 'Give me that phone; I'm ready to work.' '' **********And Mr. Garcia was not the only one. Instead of laying off all its rig crews, Grey Wolf decided to keep about 400 of its best and most-skilled workers on the payroll. **********The practice by oil service companies, including Grey Wolf, Global Marine Inc. and Rowan Companies, to hold on to some rig workers even when there is not enough work is a significant departure for a cyclical industry that is used to letting people go at the first signs of a slump. **********Mr. Garcia and the other rig workers still employed are the exceptions. Tens of thousands of oil workers have been laid off in the last six months. The number of oil and gas rigs operating in the country continues to slide. The number of rigs fell to 544 as of Feb. 5 from 558 the previous week and down from 972 a year ago, Baker Hughes Inc. said on Friday in its weekly survey. It was the fourth consecutive week the number has reached a record low, said Baker Hughes, which has been counting the nation's rigs since 1944. **********Some companies, however, have decided to hold on to a core of workers to man the rigs until crude oil prices recover and demand for rigs picks up. **********''We've learned from the previous downturns where most companies simply reacted to declining revenue and just cut people accordingly,'' said Gary Lee, the vice president of human resources at Grey Wolf. ''We're trying to plan for the return of the good times.'' **********At Rowan, E. E. Thiele, a senior vice president, said that the company had about 11 rigs that were not in operation, yet each rig was manned by 65 employees, who were making repairs and upgrading equipment. That meant that about 700 workers are being kept on the payroll although the company is not getting any revenue. **********''You can do that as long as you have cash,'' he said. When times are good, Rowan adds to its reserves, which currently total $100 million. **********Mr. Thiele said this policy would end up saving money in the long run. ''The crews get used to working together, which means you have fewer accidents on the rigs,'' he said. ''When things pick up, you have trained people, which means you save on the training costs.'' **********Indeed, fresh in the memory of the management of oil service companies is that only a year ago the oil industry was scrambling to find skilled workers to run rigs, which were in high demand. Day rates, the cost of renting an oil rig per day, were at record levels. **********The industry was plagued with safety and quality problems as companies hired inexperienced workers. As the labor pool dried up, many companies were forced to turn to experienced but less desirable workers who had poor work records. **********To cope with the shortage of workers, many companies set up expensive training programs. Some added more supervisors to handle crews on the more sophisticated offshore rigs, which can cost more than $100 million to build. One mistake can end up disabling a rig, causing a huge loss of revenue if it is idled for repairs. **********The labor shortages and problems became so severe last spring that some companies ended up having to turn business away. **********With each downturn, the oil industry has seen its pool of workers shrink. From the boom times in the early 1980's, when there were more than 400,000 oilfield service workers, the industry has gone into a protracted slump of close to 10 years. Hundreds of companies went bankrupt or were taken over. Tens of thousands of skilled workers have retired or gone into other fields. Today, there are about 200,000 employed oil service workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********But the shrinkage of the oil service industry also means that the smaller fleet of rigs is hired very quickly when demand picks up. **********Thus, Grey Wolf wants to hold on to workers like Mr. Garcia for use when the good times return. Mr. Garcia demonstrated his skill recently as he maneuvered a two-ton drilling weight like a feather to add a piece of pipe after the crew had reached 6,000 feet in Rosenberg, Tex. **********At the end of the 12-hour shift, during which he sometimes took refuge in a little cabin atop the rig to escape the cold wind, he prepared dinner for his crew. **********He has always been eager to work the 12-hour shifts for seven days straight, even willing to take on extra work on his days off, for which he gets paid extra. **********''When they call I'm ready to work,'' he said in a telephone interview from his house on 10 acres in Ricardo, Tex., about 45 miles southwest of Corpus Christi. He recently built a barn for his horses. **********The oil service industry, however, remains under pressure. There is little chance that crude oil prices will recover soon, and the stocks of oil service companies have fallen sharply. The Philadelphia oil service sector index is down 59 percent from the 52-week high it reached on May 4. As a result, most oil service companies are still digging in for a long-term slump: slashing their costs and letting thousands of workers go. **********''Tough times are ahead,'' said Bob Rose, the president of Global Marine. **********But others are preparing for the time when demand picks up. A school for oil service workers in Abilene, Tex., was reopened a year ago by the Texas Engineering Extension Service of Texas A&M University. The current class has 11 students, and Wayne Davis, who runs the school, is optimistic that they will find jobs. **********''There's going to be a scarcity of skilled employees,'' he predicted."

Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.61 percent, from 5.66 percent on Monday. The two-year note gained 3/32, to 99 24/32, to yield 5.13 percent, down  from 5.18 percent the previous day. **********The Treasury was an active seller of debt yesterday, selling $10 billion of new 52-week bills and $19 billion of 12-day cash management bills. The 12-day bills are used to meet the Treasury's short-term cash needs and are an addition to its regular schedule of debt sales. **********The auction of 52-week bills went well, analysts said, thanks to the increase of nearly 30 basis points in yields since last month's auction. The bills were awarded at an average rate of 4.665 percent, with the number of bids the best since last September's auction. The rate of the 12-day cash management bill came in at 4.79 percent. **********Elsewhere in the bond market, Colombia sold a five-year note that was priced to yield 11.587 percent, or 6.3 percentage points over the comparable Treasury issue. The issue was another indication that Brazil's devaluation of its currency in January has had much less fallout than feared. **********This was the first bond that Colombia has sold since Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on some bonds last August. The high yield attracted enough investors to raise the issue to $500 million from $400 million, said Rachel Hines, the managing director for Latin American capital markets at J. P.

It also suggests that such trading can be hard to police, leaving regulators with few ways to track who is making profits from questionable trading activity. **********The situation has aroused concern at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is separately investigating how the New York Stock Exchange regulates floor brokers and their trading for clients. **********In filing charges in February 1998 against eight brokers, including an official at the New York Stock Exchange, prosecutors said the group reaped more than $11 million in illegal trading profits. The group was said to have traded for accounts in which they had an interest, a violation of Federal securities laws since traders on the exchange floor have access to valuable information about orders to buy and sell stocks. **********Federal Judge Jed Rakoff, who was preparing to accept guilty pleas from four stockbrokers and two executives of the Oakford Corporation, which submitted the trades, expressed surprise and dismay at the Government's acknowledgment that it could not calculate the trading profits. The amount is important since it would help determine Federal sentencing guidelines for those who pleaded guilty. **********In response, Judge Rakoff said he might hold his own hearing to determine monetary damages. At that, the defendants got cold feet, apparently concerned that they might get stiffer sentences than they had expected. And the hearing and possible pleas were postponed until 11 A.M. today. **********Also yesterday, prosecutors tentatively agreed to drop the charges against the New York Stock Exchange floor official, John R. D'Alessio, who was named in last year's indictment. Government lawyers said ''no direct evidence'' existed that Mr. D'Alessio violated any stock exchange rules. **********The Government had already won three guilty pleas in its case against New York Stock Exchange floor brokers, and it appeared to be substantially widening the case. In a letter earlier this year to lawyers for the defendants, prosecutors said that they had substantial evidence that illegal trading was widespread on the floor of the exchange. **********That was exactly what the defendants had been contending -- with the additional assertion that the exchange only began enforcing rules against it after the United States Attorney filed the current case. As such, the defendants believed that they should not be punished for something that even a top exchange official said was a longstanding practice. **********That practice was the sharing of profits on trades requested by firms that were not exchange members; those trades were executed by brokers on the floor, who received commissions for their work. In some cases, those commissions were essentially a percentage of the profits on a trade. **********In fighting the charges, the remaining defendants shrugged off guilty pleas already entered by three brokers who worked on the exchange floor who were also named in the original indictment. One of those already had been sentenced to 15 months in prison. **********Most of the remaining defendants had agreed to plead guilty to one charge of trading in an account over which they had discretion, a violation of the exchange's rules. **********For the purposes of sentencing, the United States Attorney's office said in a statement that ''there was not a reasonable basis upon which to determine the amount of gain from these specific discretionary trades, and therefore that there would be no upward adjustment under the sentencing guidelines for any gain.'' **********According to lawyers involved in the case, the defendants expected that they would be subject to Federal sentencing guidelines that could put them behind bars for no more than six months. And possibly, the lawyers said, they would get no jail time at all. **********The original charges carried prison terms of up to five years, three years probation and a fine of up to $250,000 or two times the amount of profits derived from the offense. Federal sentencing guidelines put the sentence, however, at 15 months to 20 months in prison. **********The prospect of such a prison term caused defense lawyers to reconsider their plea agreements, at least temporarily. **********Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's Office, said in a statement that if the defendants do not go ahead with guilty pleas today, the Government will proceed to trial on the charges. Judge Rakoff has scheduled a trial to begin June 1."

For instance, the roster of exhibitors is dominated, as usual, by programmers -- MTV Networks, Romance Classics, the Game Show Network. **********But judging by the program schedule and some hallway talk here, much of the buzz in the cable television industry is not about cable television at all. Instead, a lot of the excitement is about delivering high-speed Internet service and even telephone calls using the cable industry's ''broadband communications pipe,'' otherwise known as the coaxial cable lines that pass almost all of the nation's homes. **********Among the sessions this year are ''Internet 2,'' ''Introducing High-Speed Data Services'' and ''Topics in Broadband Data Networking.'' **********It takes only three letters to explain the shift: AT&T. At this time last year, AT&T was known simply for being the No. 1 long-distance phone company. But since then, AT&T's chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, has committed more than $90 billion to also become the nation's biggest cable company, acquiring Tele-Communications Inc. in the process. AT&T, faced with looming competition from the Baby Bell local phone giants in its core long-distance market, wants to retaliate by using cable systems to deliver integrated packages of telephone and data service. (And yes, television.) **********On Monday, Mr. Armstrong will come out as a Cable Guy. He is scheduled to give the morning's keynote address, ''Enter the Broadband Millennium.'' Even more telling, he is sticking around to socialize, holding a reception here Monday. **********Referring to the cable industry's commitments a few years ago to deliver advanced services, Decker Anstrom, the association's president, said in a telephone interview last week: ''There is a focus on delivering what we promised in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Since the act, the industry has invested $20 billion in physical plant to deliver new products and competition to the local phone companies.'' **********He noted, though, that as sexy as the Internet may be, the cable industry's bread and butter remains television and its main battle continues to be against the broadcast networks. For every Mr. Armstrong here, there is a Sumner M.Redstone, chairman of the programming giant Viacom International (who is speaking Tuesday morning), and a Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, who closes the convention Wednesday."

It is unclear whether such talks are continuing, but the person said that no agreement was imminent. **********Still, amid reports of a possible merger, many analysts and industry consultants said yesterday that any such deal would be very difficult to achieve. They noted that the cost savings that other oil mergers had  attained would be difficult with two streamlined companies and that antitrust issues would be more pronounced than with other oil mergers because of Chevron's and Texaco's heavy presence on the West Coast. **********Indeed, the stocks of both companies steadied yesterday after sharp moves on Friday, when speculation about a possible deal was rampant. **********Texaco shares fell $1.375 yesterday, to $65.875. On Friday, the stock surged 8 percent. Chevron shares rose $1.375 yesterday, to $96.25, after falling 3 percent on Friday. **********Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Chevron was in talks to acquire Texaco for about $80 a share, or about $42 billion. **********Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on whether they were in talks. **********Since the $42.8 billion takeover of the Amoco Corporation by British Petroleum in August, which then also reached an agreement to buy the Atlantic Richfield Company last month, there has been pressure on other major oil companies to merge. The Exxon Corporation, the largest oil company in the United States,  reached an $80 billion agreement early in December to take over the Mobil Corporation, the second-largest United States oil company. **********''Now it's a game of musical chairs when the music has stopped,'' said Michael Young, an oil analyst for Deutsche Bank Securities in Boston. He referred to the remaining major oil companies that had not found merger partners. **********The problem, he said, is that it was hard to demonstrate how Chevron and Texaco, which had both cut costs extensively in recent years and announced another round of cuts last year when crude oil prices plunged, could achieve further large savings by combining. **********''Both companies are already operating on a lean basis,'' he said. In December, Texaco executives outlined a belt-tightening that would take another $650 million out of costs annually and to cut 3,000 jobs. A good part of its corporate headquarters in White Plains will be rented out. **********Chevron, which is based in San Francisco, said it plans to cut another $500 million out of its cost structure on top of the $2.4 billion it has already achieved since 1991. **********Harry Quarls, a senior vice president for Booz Allen & Hamilton, a consulting firm, said that if Chevron paid a premium of about $10 billion for Texaco it would have to find about $1 billion in cost savings to justify the merger. That would not be easy, he added. **********He also said that it would be a challenge to work out the management transition since there were strong and independent-minded executives on both sides. **********Peter Bijur, the chairman and chief executive of Texaco, who is 57 years old and who took over in July 1996, ''is young and just starting his tenure,'' Mr. Quarls said. **********Kenneth T. Derr, the chairman and chief executive of Chevron, who is 62 years old, has spearheaded Chevron's entry into the Caspian region, where it has bought into production major fields in Kazakhstan. It is the first Western oil company to get large amounts of oil from the region into foreign markets. **********Even if the two executives could work out a way to overcome their independence and find a way to manage together, they would face major problems in coming up with a way to demonstrate to the Federal Trade Commission that their presence in refining and marketing on the West Coast and other parts of the country would not be anticompetitive. **********Another complication is an alliance that Texaco formed last year with the Shell Oil Company, the United States arm of the Royal Dutch/ Shell Group, to combine and revamp their refining, which now controls about 15 percent of the American market. **********Most of the work has been done. It would be complicated for Texaco to find a way to get the alliance to fit into a merger with Chevron, which is one of the largest refiners and marketers of gasoline in the country."

They wind up reinventing structures like the triangle. The scientists who set the programs in action in the first place have built the designs, using Lego components, and given the artificial architects a limited vote of confidence. **********''I'm not saying a computer can replace an architect -- at least, not yet,'' said Jordan B. Pollack, a professor in the computer science department at Brandeis University's Center for Complex Systems in Waltham, Mass. ''But our computer did start with a simple algorithm and end with blueprints for structures that it took humans hundreds of years to develop. And when we built the structures, they were functional.'' **********The structures Dr. Pollack is talking about are modest ones: tables, bridges and cranes made from toy blocks. But as he and Pablo Funes, an Argentine graduate student, report in the current issue of the journal Artificial Life, the computer came up with structures that could be built without specific guidance from them. **********What the computer was given was a program that included the laws of physics and some random patterns of Lego bricks. It was also given the ability to let its designs evolve, in a ''survival of the fittest'' system. Then the programmers stepped back. **********Dr. Pollack's field, evolutionary computing, is a futuristic place where computers solve problems without being programmed to do so, selecting the fittest solutions by mimicking natural selection. Dr. Pollack predicts that evolutionary computing may one day lead to robots smart enough to generate and test themselves with no human engineering costs whatsoever, making them cheap enough to be disposable. For now, though, Dr. Pollack and his graduate student are at an early stage. **********The computer did have some initial input from the two scientists. Mr. Funes wrote the program that gave the computer the background in physics it needed to get started -- no small job. And Dr. Pollack and Mr. Funes together developed an evolutionary strategy for generating and testing designs. **********Then the computer was given randomly chosen initial designs and permitted to proceed through ''mutations'' -- random modifications of the locations of the bricks -- or  ''crossovers'' -- random switches of pieces of two parent designs. Each ''offspring'' design was then rated for fitness. **********''We didn't teach the computer how to design triangles or counterbalances,'' Dr. Pollack explained. ''It figured this out without any engineering advice from us.'' As the computer designed a crane, for example, it selected a triangle to make the crane's base more stable -- something it knew how to do by applying the laws of physics. **********''It used the interaction of evolutionary algorithms and the laws of physics to produce these interesting, very functional structures that carry weights effectively at certain heights,'' Dr. Pollack said. ''It came up with fairly sophisticated solutions.'' **********When the computer was done with a task, Dr. Pollack and his student built the design according to the blueprint produced, building a crane that lifts one kilogram, a two-meter bridge, a table. ''Ours are one of the first systems in evolutionary robotics where evolution-in-simulation translated into reality,'' Dr. Pollack said. **********His long-term vision is for computers to produce robots by specifying both the mechanical bodies and the neural networks to control them. The blueprint would be turned over to a fully automated factory that would fabricate the robots ''as cheaply as today they make Sony Walkmans,'' he said. **********Dr. David Fogel, the chief scientist at Natural Selection, a company in La Jolla, Calif., that uses evolutionary algorithms to solve problems in medicine and industry, works in areas related to Dr. Pollack's. **********''The most critical thing in Pollack's work is that he demonstrates that you do not need to have specific expertise in, say, mechanical engineering to design a useful construct,'' he said. ''All you need is a simple evolutionary algorithm and a good model of the physics of the environment. The significant thing is that he didn't design the crane -- the program did.'' **********Dr. Fogel, too, uses evolutionary programming, but he does not test designs with Legos. Instead, he focuses on the game of checkers, in addition to looking at more serious building blocks like molecules. Using as little expert information as possible, he and a colleague wrote an evolutionary program to see if the computer could teach itself to play checkers at an expert level. **********The computer's tactics evolved as it played against itself. After 10 generations, it defeated both Dr. Fogel and a graduate student. ''After 100 evolutions, we put it on the Internet,'' he said, ''and let it play against opponents without telling them they were playing a program, not a person.'' The program has moved up to the fourth-highest ranking, Class A, for checkers players. **********Dr. John Koza, an expert in evolutionary programming who is president of Genetic Programming, in Los Altos, Calif., cited many examples of automatically created solutions that were competitive with results produced by people. As one example, he pointed to circuits that are so original they infringe on patents. ''This is significant because if you automatically create something that infringes, you have created the essence of that invention,'' he said."

But he added, ''The more the population suffers, the more it rallies to Saddam Hussein and strengthens him.'' **********France opposed the British and American bombing of Iraq late last year for its refusal to cooperate with United Nations arms inspections. It hopes to get the United Nations Security Council to approve a new plan to lift restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq can sell abroad if its leadership will agree to a new system of permanent monitoring of sites that could be used to make or store weapons of mass destruction. **********As French officials explain the proposal, sophisticated outside monitoring of what Iraq does with the revenues from oil sales, plus television and satellite monitoring of the weapons sites, would provide effective warning of any new attempts to buy or make components for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. **********In any case, Mr. Chirac and others say, any controls would be more effective than none -- and now there are none inside Iraq. **********The United States has rejected lifting the embargo.

But if the international community made clear that it would let Iraq import more medicine, food and other necessities if Mr. Hussein agreed to a new system of arms controls, the Baghdad Government might feel more pressure to go along with them, Mr. Chirac contended. **********Both French and American military officials fear that the longer the current impasse continues, with American and British warplanes bombing Iraqi air defense sites almost daily, the greater the risk that eventually an American plane could be shot down and the crew lost or taken prisoner, bringing on a new international diplomatic crisis. **********In Washington today, James Foley, a spokesman for the State Department, said department officials had not yet seen the text of Mr. Chirac's remarks, and thus were unable to address them specifically. **********He restated the United States view that Iraq must comply with Security Council resolutions before the embargo can be lifted."

Mr. Jiang yelled to the assembled troops, who included camouflage-green-clad marines, blue-suited air force officers and militia women in red miniskirted uniforms. ''You are working hard!'' **********Though he looked tentative and uncertain as he stepped to the rostrum at Tiananmen -- the Gate of Heavenly Peace -- and remained dour and unsmiling, Mr. Jiang was clearly meant to appear firmly in charge. Alone among China's top leaders today, Mr. Jiang wore a Mao suit. **********Oct. 1 will long be remembered in China for the day 50 years ago when Mao stood atop Tiananmen and proclaimed that the Chinese people had finally stood up, after decades of civil war and foreign invasion. The last major Oct. 1 celebration was staged on the 35th anniversary, in 1984, to celebrate Deng's rule and his program for economic growth, and today was clearly intended to mark Mr. Jiang's turn in the pantheon. **********''Fifty years ago today, Chairman Mao proclaimed here to the world that a new China was established and that the Chinese people had stood up,'' Mr. Jiang told the assembled crowd, his voice echoing around the square. ''We will continue to adhere to the party's basic line and program.'' **********Yet to many Chinese, Mr. Jiang displays a distinct lack of the vision and charisma that were so apparent in Mao and Deng, and he does not even seem to believe in the Communist ideology that he still talks about in public. He often seems to symbolize the Government's confused stance on its most basic issue: should China be Communist or capitalist? **********For anyone taking the 50th birthday as a time to consider broad historical trends, China's direction seems clear: Communist authority is being slowly but inexorably undermined each day by the twin forces of money and information, the same dynamic powers that have invaded other countries with a maturing economy. **********Outsiders remark at the seemingly peaceful coexistence of Communist Party rule and burgeoning capitalism. Yet a quiet battle is actually under way all over this country, visible on any street corner in this city where McDonald's restaurants or mobile phone stores signal the arrival of hard-to-control entities. **********In China's news media, the 50th anniversary has been an occasion to release, under the pretense of a consideration of history, long strings of praise and seemingly mindless slogans. **********''The course of 50 years of struggle tells us that only socialism can save China,'' said the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily in an editorial this morning. **********The party's claim to national strength and tranquillity are belied by tough limits on freedom of speech and assembly, rights that are spelled out in China's Constitution, particularly about a political issue as sensitive as Oct. 1 itself. **********''We were told what to print,'' said a Shanghai newspaper editor, referring to coverage of the celebrations. **********Like many Chinese, he said he was indifferent to the holiday, although he was glad that the authorities gave office and factory workers a week off. Few of his friends, the editor said, were likely to give much thought to whether there is any deeper meaning in Communist China's 50th birthday. **********The reason that the Government awarded extra vacation days appears to have been to compensate many people for troubles incurred by organizers. **********Nearly half of Beijing was put under martial law to insure a smooth operation of today's proceedings, a reminder of how anything as basic as freedom of movement is still secondary to the vanity of the nation's leaders. Leaving little to chance, the authorities ordered shut every window facing Beijing's main avenue, and blocked some residents from leaving their homes for two days."

The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond declined 20/32, to 97 13/32. Its yield rose to 6.32 percent from 6.27 percent on Wednesday, the highest level since Oct. 22, 1997, when it reached 6.41 percent. **********The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales were up last month, but not as much as expected, while the Labor Department stirred market fears with a report saying that prices of imported goods kept rising last month. **********Analysts argued that yesterday's figures had proved counterproductive for the bond market because they did not really suggest that the trend of strong consumer spending had changed. **********Referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Donald Fine of Chase Asset Management said, ''The bond market has been in a heightened state of alert for signs of inflation now that the F.O.M.C. is officially biased toward tightening, particularly in light of upcoming data that are not expected to be market-friendly.'' **********He continued: ''While the Fed specifically stated that it is not committed to any near-term action, a firming of its policy stance at the next F.O.M.C. meeting on Nov. 16 is a distinct possibility, and in fact is now expected by market participants, judging from the spread between the two-year Treasury note and the Federal funds rate. At this juncture, it would appear that only a sudden, significant deterioration in the economy's performance or imminent sharp contraction in the stock market could quickly alleviate inflation concerns and keep the Fed at bay.'' **********Consumer spending, the key to the economic outlook, still seems healthy. September retail sales rose one-tenth of a percent, compared with the two-tenths of a point that had been expected. But, some argued, this did not seem to indicate a slowdown in the economy since it came on the heels of outsized increases of 1.5 percent and 1 percent in August and July, respectively. **********Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities, said the retail sales report masked powerful third-quarter growth. ''U.S. consumers paused for breath in September,'' she said, ''but the underlying trend remains undeniably strong. Even with the September lull, sales are still up a towering 10.5 percent from year-ago levels and they expanded at a healthy 9.5 percent annual pace in the third quarter.'' **********Analysts are awaiting today's producer price figures. They forecast that the core and overall price figures will be up four-tenths or five-tenths of a percent, stronger than in recent months. ''Each new piece of strong data is adding to fears that the Fed is falling behind,'' said Stanley Shepard of Standard & Poor's MMS in San Francisco. **********Many investors are opting to buy corporate debt to give them a bigger yield cushion if inflation accelerates. **********Robert Pugliese, fixed-income director at the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla., said he saw a lack of conviction in the market at this point, with not many people willing to make buying bets. ''If the P.P.I. number takes an inflationary turn, I see the long-bond yield gravitating toward 6.5 percent,'' he said. ''If it proves benign, do not expect a major rally, either.''"

https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/22/business/media-business-advertising-agencies-hold-their-annual-conference-accentuation.html,Stuart Elliott,1999-04-22,American Association of Advertising Agencies is holding its annual meeting in northern Florida; meeting brings together top executives of industry that is enjoying what is likely to be sixth consecutive year of robust growth (Advertising column) (...,1031,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,"As agencies hold their annual conference, the accentuation is very much on the positive.","THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; As agencies hold their annual conference, the accentuation is very much on the positive."," **********THE sunny skies over Madison Avenue, metaphorically speaking, are likely to extend to northern Florida at the 81st annual meeting of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. **********The meeting, which began yesterday at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Amelia Island, brings together top executives of an industry that is enjoying what is likely to be a sixth consecutive year of robust growth. And for the largest agencies, whose executives are most visible at such conferences -- from the meeting rooms to the golf courses to the bars -- business has rarely been better. **********The optimistic mood is reflected in attendance for the event, which continues through Saturday: executives from member agencies are expected to turn out at the highest rate since 1990, the last year before a wrenching recession took hold. **********When times are tough, members hunker down at home, passing up stays at ritzy hotels. When their mood is ebullient, $255 a night at a ''special conference rate,'' as described in the meeting brochure, is not too costly an expense. **********Because this could well be ''a record year for the industry by any measure,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association, which is known as the Four A's, ''everybody's going to this meeting in very high spirits.'' **********As a result, he added in an interview before the meeting began, he planned to devote his annual speech opening the general session this morning to ''12 things to celebrate.'' By comparison, Mr. Drake's opening speech last year centered on concerns that he thought needed to be addressed. **********Two issues that bothered association members in 1998 seem less pressing. One was the encroachment of management consultants into the realm of brand-building services offered by agencies. **********''Last year, we seemed to be a little more up in arms about being under attack from consultants,'' said Patrick J. McGrath, the 1998-99 chairman of the association who is president and chief executive at Jordan McGrath Case & Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising. **********''But now, rather than worrying,'' he added, ''the smart thing seems to be to reassert what we do, how we do things that no consultant can do.'' **********Mr. McGrath said that he would describe one way to accomplish that in a speech scheduled for this morning. He plans to outline the efforts of a group formed at the 1998 meeting to produce ''The Chairman's Initiative,'' a series of taped interviews with ''C.E.O.'s of major corporations, talking about how important advertising agencies have been to their brands and businesses.'' **********Mr. McGrath said he would show segments of the initial tapes, featuring John Pepper, chairman of the Procter & Gamble Company, who is speaking at the meeting, and Herbert D. Kelleher, chairman, president and chief executive of the Southwest Airlines Company. **********Four additional executives have agreed to be interviewed for the series, Mr. McGrath said: Robert A. Eckert, president and chief executive of the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies; Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Hasbro Inc.; Edward B. Rust Jr., chairman, president and chief executive of the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, and Stephen W. Sanger, chairman and chief executive of General Mills Inc. **********The other issue that bothered members last year involved a surprise move by the Association of National Advertisers, the trade organization that represents marketers, to invite agencies to join. That initiative was announced at the annual conference of the advertiser association in October, with little or no consultation with officials of the Four A's. **********''That triggered a decision point for advertising agencies, to affirm or deny whether we need an industry association,'' said Shelly Lazarus, the 1998-99 chairwoman of the Four A's, who is chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, part of WPP Group P.L.C. **********''The answer was a resounding yes,'' said Ms. Lazarus, who favors agency membership in the advertiser association, followed by ''a certain searching for a reaffirmation of what is valuable to our members.'' **********''That makes some people nervous,'' she added, ''but I think it's healthy.'' **********Ms. Lazarus, who is to speak on Saturday, said she intended to discuss the need for agencies ''to know how to work their magic through every point of contact, every way of reaching consumers, or lose our appeal to clients.'' **********Another topic on her agenda, she said, was the ''opportunity for getting the talent we need for the future'' by taking advantage of the ''fascination with the new media'' among young potential employees. **********''If we're viewed as being at the center of trying to figure out a whole new world of communications, that would be extremely compelling to them,'' Ms. Lazarus said. ''But if we're seen as 'the place to call if you want a television commercial,' we will not be particularly interesting to future talent -- or to clients.'' **********At a business session that opened the meeting -- formally known as the 1999 management conference and annual meeting -- Ms. Lazarus was elected chairwoman of the Four A's for 1999-2000. **********Also, Phil Dusenberry, chairman of BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, was elected vice chairman for 1999-2000. And John Emmerling, chairman and chief creative officer at Emmerling Post in New York, was elected secretary and treasurer for 1999-2000. **********While attendees may be beaming over the bright forecasts for the industry, the actual weather is of some concern. That is because Amelia Island was the site of a previous conference that became synonymous with disastrous weather among the denizens of Madison Avenue. **********In October 1996, the marketers' association held its annual conference at the Ritz-Carlton during a rare Florida northeaster that lasted throughout the entire event. Many attendees, forced inside and deprived of their patio cocktails and sports tournaments, developed cabin fever and fled. The pouring rain and gale-force winds did not relent until the conference ended. **********''Florida and I are not a good combination,'' Ms. Lazarus said when reminded of the incident. ''Whenever I go, it really rains.'' **********Mr. Drake called the 1996 conference ''the worst four days of my life.'' **********''But I have my fingers crossed,'' he said. ''I figure the A.N.A. had all the bad luck and the Four A's is due for some good luck.'' **********Mr. McGrath agreed. **********His weather forecast? ''Bring your shorts.''"

The decision was reached at a meeting led by Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein and attended by government lawyers, Holocaust experts and Mr. Friesel. **********Professor Yehuda Bauer, a prominent Holocaust scholar who took part in the meeting, advised against the immediate and unfettered publication of the memoirs. **********''All kinds of clowns will go over the manuscript and take tidbits out of context, and yellow journalists will use it to write yellow journalism which has nothing to do with Holocaust research,'' he said. ''This is a matter of life and death of masses of people. The truth has to be respected.'' **********Gabriel Bach, who was the deputy prosecutor in the trial, said he was concerned that publishing the memoirs could be used to question the verdict. ''Someone could come and say that this sheds a different light on the subject, and we'll have to explain again what we successfully refuted during the trial,'' he said. ''If scholars publish it with the proper explanations, perhaps less damage will be done.'' **********However Tom Segev, a historian and author who has written about the Holocaust, argued that the reluctance to allow immediate and free public access to the memoirs betrayed fears whose time had passed. ''We're scared to death that this document will be a counterweight to the verdict which is still seen as the central charter that explains why Israel has a right to exist,'' he said. ''This sets us back 40 years.''"

That Can't Say No; Overcapacity in Manufacturing Sector Slows Recovery,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Japan Inc. That Can't Say No; Overcapacity in Manufacturing Sector Slows Recovery," **********Some 25 years ago, Itsuhiro Ochi quit his job as a salaryman at a large textile manufacturer and built a factory here to make towels. **********He is now the proprietor of the biggest business in the biggest industry in this quaint seaside town on the northern coast of Shikoku, the smallest of the four main islands in the Japanese archipelago, presiding over five factories and 600 employees that produced 3,200 metric tons of towels last year. **********Mr. Ochi is a hardy survivor in a Japanese towel industry that is a shrunken version of what it once was. Almost 50 percent of Shikoku's towel companies closed down in the last decade, wrung out of business by more competitive manufacturers in China and Vietnam and by their own high cost of doing business. **********But with so many low-wage countries able to supply consumers with towels, what is one of the most advanced industrial nations in the world still doing with 250 factories continuing to churn out many more towels than Japan needs? **********The question reveals a lot about Japan's current economic distress, which has been exacerbated by a powerful bias against eliminating the vast amounts of excess production capacity that plague not just towel makers but also producers of cars, steel, semiconductors, consumer electronics, auto parts and other goods. **********Wasteful and unneeded production facilities are the biggest drag on Japan's vast manufacturing sector, pulling down profits at giants like Toyota and Hitachi as well as thousands of anonymous mom-and-pop suppliers. ''The real problem in Japan is not the credit crunch,'' said Kathy Matsui, the chief strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. ''The real problem is excess capacity.'' **********Japanese companies continued to invest in factories and equipment even after the so-called bubble economy burst in 1989, blindly continuing to pursue the export-led growth strategy so successfully used to create economic strength after World War II. **********As the economy slid into its deepest recession of the postwar years, tangible fixed assets climbed more than 60 percent, according to Ms. Matsui. Now, a huge portion of those assets are unused or underused, making it all but impossible for companies to justify new investments to spur growth. **********''Government officials here and abroad have been mistaken in describing this recession as a consumer-led recession,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist. ''It's a recession of overinvestment.'' **********The auto industry is everyone's favorite illustration of the problem. Japanese car makers collectively can produce 14 million vehicles here, but this year they will make just 10.4 million -- 8.5 percent fewer cars than they made in 1997. And as auto operations expand abroad, the need for so much capacity in Japan will probably dwindle even more. **********But so far, companies have either ignored the problem or tried to tackle it with chopsticks when they need a battering ram. The closing of the Nissan Motor Company factory in Zama, southwest of Tokyo, in 1995 is the only significant effort at tackling the problem that anyone can remember. Yet the company retained the plant's employees, a traditional and generous move that left it saddled with the bulk of the plant's costs. **********''We have not let the markets work to close inefficient or unprofitable factories and inefficient and unprofitable businesses,'' said Akio Mikuni, founder and president of Mikuni & Company, Japan's oldest independent credit rating agency. ''Factories have to be closed, but in most cases, they will keep their factories open and running and producing things for which there is no demand.'' **********There are a few signs of change. The Toyota Motor Corporation and Nissan are considering closing production lines to improve efficiency, and the Mitsubishi Rayon Company is closing an acrylic yarn plant in Ogaki and relocating it to Indonesia, reducing capacity at one of its subsidiaries by 40 percent. **********Capital investment is finally in a steep decline, a slump that Mr. Nakamae finds encouraging. ''Companies are correcting overinvestment and at an accelerating rate,'' he said. **********Imabari has already seen a sharp correction. The Shikoku Towel Industrial Association had more than 400 members a decade ago; it now has 240. Domestic production of towels fell to 54,397 tons in 1997, from 101,792 tons at the industry's peak in 1991. **********Yet supply still exceeds demand by about 30,000 tons, according to Yoshide Yoshihara, the association's chairman, largely because of cheaper imports, which have more than tripled in the last decade. He insists, however, that the domestic industry is not suffering from too much output, an opinion echoed by Mr. Ochi and other towel makers. He says it is normal to have about 30,000 tons of stock on hand. **********''I don't think there is that much overcapacity,'' Mr. Yoshihara said, although he wistfully added that he would not mind seeing some mergers or acquisitions take place. ''I would like to see those kinds of changes, but it's difficult.'' **********Why? Because consolidation aimed at reducing production capacity and costs will almost inevitably involve laying off employees, which is nearly taboo in Japan, where lifetime employment is still a critical component of the tacit social code. In discussing the possibility of Toyota's closing a plant, for instance, Tetsuo Kitagawa, a spokesman, repeatedly stressed such a closing ''would not mean direct layoffs or significant unemployment.'' **********Tatsuya Higaki, the assistant manager of the industry division of the Imabari municipal government, said, ''The social aspects of employment here make it difficult to fire people just because the economy is bad or demand is declining.'' **********So most Japanese companies rely on a slow process of natural attrition to winnow their ranks and pray that the economy will improve before they are forced to take more drastic action. Despite the efforts to avoid layoffs, unemployment has risen sharply in Japan, actually matching the United States level of 4.4 percent last month. **********Seiichiro Murakami, who represents Imabari in the Lower House of Parliament, is sadly convinced that his district's biggest business has no choice but to consolidate further. ''With the higher yen and high labor costs we have in Japan, companies like Toyota and Nissan started building factories overseas,'' he said. ''In the towel industry, the same thing has happened, and now factories in China and Southeast Asia are producing towels of the very same quality you find in Imabari but at a fraction of the cost.'' **********Mr. Murakami figures there need be no more than 100 companies in Shikoku making towels, noting that Germany makes do with just one domestic towel manufacturer. The United States has only a handful of highly efficient major towel makers, which also produce a substantial share in low-wage countries in Latin America and Asia. **********But as plainspoken as Mr. Murakami is in an interview about the industry's need to shrink, he has yet to breathe a word of his thoughts to his constituents. ''I can't say it to them,'' he said. ''It's too cruel.'' **********So over the last five years the prefectural government has spent upward of 465 million yen, or about $4.2 million at current exchange rates, in an effort to put some zip into the local towel business. It has urged manufacturers to cut out wholesalers and streamline distribution to retain more of the profits. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Higaki and others have worked hard to steer the towel-making business away from towels as commodities and toward making high-quality, designer towels suitable for gift-giving. In conjunction with the local government, the towel association is developing a brand name, fuwari, which means soft and light, for the region's towel products. Towel makers are also incorporating design elements into their products to distinguish them from those made in Southeast Asia and China. **********The target? Japanese consumers, who give towels on all sorts of occasions and particularly in return for the traditional cash gifts from friends to family members of someone who dies. **********In a bid to build a high-quality image, Yoshiyuki Yano has embraced the effort wholeheartedly. His company, Hisao K.K., is working to increase specialty towel making, which currently accounts for a little less than 10 percent of its output. Hisao has begun making a gift towel with threads embedded with porous ceramic filaments filled with an oil extracted from the skins of the mandarin oranges that proliferate on Shikoku. According to Mr. Yano, the extract has antibacterial properties -- and it also imparts a nice scent to the towels. **********The company is also exploring the use of natural dyes, and each month it sells about 30,000 highly textured, loofah-like towels made from unbleached cotton, a small success that has taken Mr. Yano by surprise. **********Cheap imports from China and Southeast Asia keep chipping away at the prices he can charge for the hotel towels that account for 40 percent of Hisao's production. He is unable to reduce costs any further because Hisao's looms are old, operating at one-third the speed of brand- new looms and in need of more maintenance. The company lacks the capital to invest in more modern equipment. But Mr. Yano is a bit thankful for Hisao's limited financial capacity because it has inhibited the company's growth. **********''I don't feel the problem of excess capacity that much because we haven't invested in expensive equipment,'' he said. His older looms have also perversely allowed him the flexibility needed to take advantage of the woes of the beleaguered hotel industry, which is placing more orders for small quantities of towels that major producers find unprofitable. **********Bigger companies, too, are adjusting their business to the new realities. Mr. Ochi built a factory in China in 1984, where he employs 600 people to produce towels at a lower cost and ships them back to Japan to sell to the mass market. **********''I saw ahead of time and I thought it might be a good idea,'' said Mr. Ochi, who now owns Japan's fourth-largest textile manufacturing business. **********In his Japanese factories, he produces high-end towels under license to various European design companies like Renoma and Fendi. A best seller is a gift set that includes tea and two towels woven with the trademark of Fauchon, the French food retailer that has a tremendous following in Japan. **********Kontex, the second-largest towel maker in Shikoku, is also reorienting its business toward higher-margin products, including a towel woven with silver. **********But as these bigger players find better ways of doing business, they will inevitably threaten smaller companies. At Kontex, Kanji Kondo, who will be the third generation of his family to run the business, is planning to increase production in hopes that higher volume will mean greater profits. **********That will only add to the glut of Japanese-made towels, however. ''This isn't like semiconductor chips,'' Mr. Murakami said sadly. ''There's not much value added in towels.''"

Tice, a Dallas fund manager and a prominent short-seller, questioned the company's accounting practices in its $30 billion acquisition binge over the last three years. He said it disguised a decline in cash flow by delaying some payments and took overly large charges to inflate future earnings. **********Its shares fell $7.375 yesterday, to $96, before trading was halted by the exchange because of an imbalance of orders. **********In its statement, Tyco said quarterly earnings, to be released Oct. 21, would exceed analysts' expectations. ''I heard the reports being circulated about our company,'' said L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's chief executive, ''and I can state unequivocally that they are false and baseless.'' **********Prominent analysts did not change their rating on the stock yesterday, and Tyco scheduled a conference call for this morning to assuage investors' fears. **********Over all, the stock market suffered its second consecutive bad day, with the main stock gauges all falling. The Dow has declined almost 4 percent this week. Even Mr. Tice acknowledged that the sharp reaction to his comments reflected a broader mood among investors. ''It's a sign of a nervous market,'' he said. **********Tyco, which is based in Bermuda, has been a star of the longstanding bull-market run, gobbling up rivals it considered poorly managed and watching its share price rise from about $11 five years ago. Through holdings including its ADT security unit, Tyco sells electronic components, fire prevention devices, alarm systems and medical products. **********In an interview yesterday, Mr. Tice said he was bothered mainly by two things: the large charges Tyco has taken after buying other companies and the drop in cash flow that few investors noticed. Mr. Tice's investment company originally made its criticisms in a report that was written by Albert Meyer, a senior analyst at the firm, and sent to investors this week. **********Write-offs can make a company's earnings look stronger than they are because many investors ignore the charges when examining current earnings but then take them into account when making comparisons in later years. ''These are the kind of cookie-jar reserves Arthur Levitt has been railing about,'' Mr. Tice said, referring to a recent campaign by the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission to crack down on accounting tricks. **********Mr. Tice also said that even though the company showed its cash flow increasing to $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 1999, up from $1.5 billion over the corresponding period in 1998, the entire jump was a result of a delay in payments of taxes and accounts due. ''It looks funny to us,'' he said. **********But Phua Young, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, dismissed those objections, saying that the S.E.C. had looked closely at each of Tyco's major acquisitions and did not find any problems. ''That gives me a sense of comfort,'' he said. **********Mr. Young also noted that Tyco had told analysts it expects cash flow to rise to $3.3 billion next year from $1.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That would make its cash flow for next year nearly as large as its projected net income, a benchmark for companies with strong balance sheets, Mr. Young said. The company expects to report $22 billion in sales for the fiscal year. **********Mr. Tice said his firm's report did not accuse the company of violating generally accepted accounting principles. **********Mr. Tice's Prudent Bear mutual fund was up 17 percent in the third quarter, making it one of the quarter's top performers, though it is down 36 percent over the last year."

Gucci denied it had engaged in any inappropriate leaking. **********''The method and timing with which Gucci makes its letters public demonstrates that these letters are actually written for the purpose of posturing, not to make substantive progress in finding a fair solution to the present situation,'' Mr. Gode wrote in a letter sent to Gucci's board today and made public by LVMH. **********LVMH, the French maker of luxury goods, also cut off negotiations by canceling a meeting with two Gucci board members, Adrian Bellamy and Charles Mackay, who had flown into Paris to meet with LVMH representatives. LVMH said it would not reopen talks unless Gucci approached with a proposal that would give an LVMH takeover bid ''a fair chance of success.'' **********''They're the ones who are trying to buy our company,'' said a Gucci spokesman. ''It's not up to us to make them offers but the other way around.'' **********The fight is set to go to court in Amsterdam next Thursday. LVMH hopes the court will cancel the share issue to Pinault that gave it a 42 percent stake in Gucci. LVMH now has a 19.6 percent stake in Gucci."

But only the country's two big commercial banks, which feared the controversy was doing them enormous harm, joined in the $1.2 billion settlement. The Government refused to take part, and Ms. Dreifuss has not dissented from that position. **********Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Business Affairs, who has led the diplomatic negotiations, noted today that the Swiss National Bank had made a $75 million contribution to a charitable fund for Holocaust survivors more than a year ago. ''The bank has said it may consider a further contribution'' after a historical commission created by the Swiss Government issues its final report, he said. **********In a meeting last week with Germany's new Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, Mr. Eizenstat opened discussions over the creation by Germany of a large, privately financed fund to compensate those who worked as slave laborers or forced laborers for German companies. **********''We believe that this is an historic effort by Chancellor Schroder and the Government to close a difficult part of the past,'' Mr. Eizenstat said in an interview today. **********Germany's problem is much like the one that faced the Swiss banks: it is seeking a ''global settlement'' that will terminate all future claims. **********Several companies have hired consultants and lawyers who worked with the Swiss in an effort to avoid several of the blunders that led to an outcry in the United States and elsewhere about their handling of the Holocaust victims. But in private, several European executives attending the World Economic Forum here have expressed concern that World War II era suits are turning into what one executive called ''a legalized form of blackmail.'' **********During the negotiations that led up to today's joint announcement by Mr. Gore and Ms. Dreifuss, American officials sought assurances from Switzerland that it had not given up on trying to create a $4.7 billion humanitarian fund, financed by selling some of the country's gold reserves. **********The creation of the fund, which would most likely require a national referendum, set off intense opposition from Swiss who believed their country was being unfairly singled out, and pressured by the United States."

The people of the Botlikh region, a high corner on the Chechen-Dagestani border, are unique to their valley and speak their own language. The stark, barren crags of the Great Caucasus mountain range where they live are even more impenetrable than the wooded mountains of Chechnya. **********A skirmish in this southernmost point of Russia may seem like a small problem with bandits in the hills. Yet at least 10 Russian soldiers have already died in five days of fighting, with many more wounded, and no accurate count of how many guerrillas have died. The casualties show that both sides regard the area and the issue important enough to fight for. The rebels have a vision and proven determination. The Russian authorities are again trying to smash incipient separatism with brute force, despite the lessons of Chechnya that such tactics may only reinforce popular resistance and could bring greater instability and even military humiliation. **********For the people of Dagestan, stuck in the middle, the conflict spells trouble. Dagestan, which only just managed to survive the fallout of the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya, is double the size of its Chechen neighbor and far more fractured, with a population of two million made up of 34 different ethnic nationalities. The power sharing between them is intricate and complicated. **********For Russia, Dagestan retains an important strategic value. Dagestan commands 70 percent of Russia's shoreline to the oil-producing Caspian Sea and its only all-weather Caspian port at Makhachkala. It provides the crucial pipeline links from Azerbaijan, where Russia maintains important oil interests. Geographically placed between Chechnya and the Caspian and Azerbaijan, it has served as a containing buffer, controlling the Chechens' access to the outside world. **********For Chechnya, which won its freedom from Russian rule but has suffered drastically from the consequent economic isolation, Dagestan offers the way out to prosperity. During the war Dagestan, and in particular the Botlikh region, became a conduit for weapons and men into and out of Chechnya. Hundreds of wounded Chechen fighters were spirited over the mountain roads to Azerbaijan for treatment. Now the routes offer the promise of trade, jobs and economic survival. **********There is much more than economics driving this confrontation, though. The men leading the incursion into Dagestan are determined revolutionaries, who want to see the whole Caucasus region free from Russian rule. They regard much of Dagestan as theirs by right, harking back to the Islamic state that resisted Russian conquest for so long in the last century. The Dagestanis they see as their Muslim brothers, but those who are loyal to Moscow they see as their enemies. **********There are few people in Dagestan who actively support independence from Russia, yet discontent with Moscow runs deep. **********Since the war in Chechnya, the republic has suffered drastic economic decline and instability. Unemployment is the highest in all of Russia, and like all people from the Caucasus, the Dagestanis suffer ethnic discrimination in Russia. Their predicament leaves them susceptible to ideas of radical Islam, or even separatism, according to Enver Kisriyev, a Dagestani sociologist. **********Mukhu Gumbatovich Aliyev, chairman of the People's Assembly of Dagestan, said in Moscow Tuesday that many polls have shown that more than 90 percent of the people in Dagestan think they remain part of Russia. He is a critic of Moscow's war in Chechnya, but says the guerrillas' incursions into Dagestan have outraged Dagestanis. **********''Our people are really incensed,'' Mr. Aliyev said. ''They are demanding that possession of firearms be legalized. We are setting up companies formed by local people in each district of Dagestan. We are setting up these detachments so that they could defend their districts.'' **********Shamil Basayev, the Chechen guerrilla commander who led his troops in the fiercest fighting of the war and executed the hostage raid on the southern Russian town of Budyonnovsk in which nearly 150 people died before Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin began negotiations that led to the release of hostages and the opening of serious peace talks to try to end the secessionist war in Chechnya, is the driving force behind the latest fighting. **********Mr. Basayev has had Dagestan in his sights for more than a year now. After six months as Chechen Prime Minister last year, he resigned to set up a formal movement called the Congress of the Peoples of Chechnya and Dagestan and head its ''peacekeeping force.'' **********''The aim is the union of Dagestan and Chechnya,'' he said in an extended interview last year. Asked if that meant removing Dagestan from Russian jurisdiction, he answered, ''Inshallah,'' which means ''God willing.'' He said that he hoped Dagestan would win independence without recourse to war, but that there were many Dagestanis willing to fight and he was prepared to help them. ''I am helping Dagestan and will help anyone who is against Russia,'' he said. **********At 34, Mr. Basayev is a fierce fighter with a clear political aim. For many years he has argued that the world is witnessing the collapse of the Russian empire and its dominance of the North Caucasus region. He was always confident that Russia would withdraw from Chechnya and predicts the same for Dagestan. **********''Dagestan will be independent, there is no doubt,'' he said. ''Russia will not have a presence in the North Caucasus, it will simply leave. Probably without war or bloodshed, it will collapse. Our job will be to prevent great bloodshed.'' **********Mr. Basayev is supported and possibly helped with funds by a commander known by his nom de guerre, Khattab, who arrived in Chechnya in early 1995 to join the fight against Russia. Khattab keeps his origins secret, but is thought to be from Jordan or Saudi Arabia and a follower of the Wahhabi sect of Islam, a conservative form practiced in Saudi Arabia. **********He fought with the rebels against the Soviet Army in Afghanistan but has since made his home in Chechnya and married a Dagestani. Wounded three times in Chechnya, he is very close to Mr. Basayev and has been training young Chechen and Dagestani fighters. His agenda, he says, is to fight the Russians and bring Islamic rule once more to the North Caucasus. **********The combination of Mr. Basayev and Khattab angers the Russian leadership. While Moscow can tolerate the moderate Chechen President, Aslan Maskhadov, it regards Mr. Basayev as a terrorist and a radical with whom it cannot negotiate, and Khattab as a dangerous foreign mercenary. **********The authorities are not even considering negotiating with them over their occupation of several villages in Dagestan, Zagir Arukhov, the deputy minister of Nationalities in Dagestan, said in a telephone interview. ''We will not go to negotiate,'' he said. ''They are bandits and we see this action as an aggression and occupation of Dagestan.'' **********So, as in Chechnya, they are resorting to helicopters and artillery to attack the rebels. **********For the people of Dagestan, the consequences could be long and terrible. Mr. Kisriyev, the sociologist,  condemned the Russian action, which he says will only bring destruction and impoverishment for the local people and throw them into the arms of the rebels. **********''People do not want war, but the entire people will gradually be drawn in, as happened in Chechnya,'' he said."

From a government that has made caution its mantra, Mr. Shara's buoyant demeanor seemed a startling departure. **********''I am so optimistic to say that a few months could be enough to reach a peace agreement,'' the foreign minister said. He said Syria regarded the meetings as ''a very important moment in the history of the peace process,'' and added, ''We think we can achieve genuine results within a short time if all the parties have the good intentions.'' **********This week's negotiations, scheduled to last two days, will be the highest-level negotiations ever between the two sides, whose conflict has lasted for more than a half-century. **********Late tonight, Israel radio also quoted Mr. Barak as saying at a gathering of his cabinet ministers that ''it is possible to complete negotiations with Syria in very little time, perhaps in a few weeks.'' **********There is a sense of expectation surrounding the planned talks, which will mark the first time in 45 months that the two sides will meet face to face. President Clinton said over the weekend that the issues dividing Syria and Israel were not as great as those in other Middle East disputes. **********''It is difficult, but not as complex in my view as the Palestinian negotiation talks with Israel,'' Mr. Clinton said in a radio interview with CBS News. **********Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, who met with Mr. Shara here today, said he believed that Syria was ''adamant that she should receive peace in the shortest possible time.'' In Berlin, meanwhile, Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister, expressed confidence that Israel could make peace with Syria within the next 12 months. **********Still, a note of caution was struck by Lebanon, which along with Syria is the last of Israel's neighbors to remain a holdout to peace. Lebanon and Syria have promised to work side by side in any negotiations, and a Lebanese delegation is expected to join in further talks after next week's opening round of discussions between Israel and Syria. **********Lebanon's president, Emile Lahoud, warned that the new talks were bound to be difficult. ''The current development in the peace process is very delicate, and the expected negotiations would not be easy; they would have their good and bad times,'' Mr. Lahoud said, according to a presidential spokesman. **********The deal to resume talks was sealed on Wednesday during a telephone conversation between Mr. Clinton and Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president. Until today, Syrian officials had not spoken publicly about the new course. **********One reason for that silence, Syrian officials say, was the need to present the plan to the National Progressive Front, which is nominally Syria's top political body. That group, composed mainly of leaders of the ruling Baath Party and led by Vice President Muhammad Zuheir Masharqa, declared its support for renewed talks at a meeting on Saturday night. **********The main issue dividing Israel and Syria is the fate of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 war. As its price for peace, Syria has always demanded that Israel withdraw from every inch of that land, but any deal would also have to address other issues, including water rights and security guarantees. **********One of the most sensitive of the issues involves the fate of a technologically advanced Israeli radar installation on the peak of Mount Hermon, at the northern tip of the Golan. The installation is usually visible from Damascus, the Syrian capital. **********A former Israeli official, Uzi Arad, was quoted by the Israeli Army radio today as saying Mr. Assad agreed in 1998 to allow Israel to retain control over the installation. But that idea has been questioned by Damascus-based diplomats, who have said they cannot imagine that Syria would accept such an arrangement."

Patterson, United's founder, to help improve the airline's employee relations. He went on to establish the airline's legal department and took on increasing responsibility, rising to become United's No. 2 executive in 1965. **********He was known as an able administrator who led a reorganization of United in 1975. But it was as a labor negotiator and spokesman for United that he made his mark. **********When a strike by machinists threatened United in the early 1970's, Mr. McErlean acted quickly to negotiate a settlement.

The mother of two daughters 10 years apart, she describes a sea change in the styles that very young children are demanding. **********''When my first child went to school, I would pick out the clothes and have no problems,'' she said of her older daughter, Jackie, now 19, who she said ''would be happy in sweat pants.'' **********''But Shana, I can't shop without her. She wants to dress like Sporty Spice,'' she said, referring to one of the Spice Girls, the pop group. ''She would never wear anything frilly, or even socks with skirts. She wears a lot of black and long skirts with tights and platform shoes. It is a very sleek line.'' **********Forget about tweens, the 12-  and 13-year-olds who make headlines with fashion perspicacity just a few years ago. Parents, educators and merchants say the newly style-empowered are children ages 6 to 10. **********The talk of the retail world this fall is the new line of clothing by Tommy Hilfiger that is aimed at girls 6 to 12 and is, by all accounts, evaporating off store shelves. At Donna Karan, the fashion-forward children's line, now a year old, is also moving ahead briskly. Ms. Karan's ankle-length waffle-knit skirt in navy with an elastic waistband and the DKNY logo, mothers say, is the hot seller among 7-year-olds, at $38 apiece. **********While children have always used fashion to fit in with their peers -- demanding the Air Jordans that are de rigueur at the playground -- their desire to match the clothing popular among older siblings and even adults is rising. The change is not so much that second-graders are asking for sexually suggestive clothing (though that happens), but that their taste is no longer the cute and innocent -- like T-shirts with hearts and teddy bears. Instead, the desire is for the culturally clued in, like the henna-style tattoo necklaces that ape the stencils worn by the pop diva Madonna. **********''It has clearly changed in the last couple of years, and it has come to a real prominence in the last year,'' said Cathy Newman, merchandising manager for children's apparel at Bloomingdale's flagship store in Manhattan. She said a clothing boutique stocked with hip-hugger stretch nylon pants and suede-fringe miniskirts that the store put together with Girl magazine, a publication ostensibly for teens, had become a magnet for the 4-to-10 set. ''Five-year-olds want to look like the kids on TV, too,'' she explained. **********The craving for chic extends beyond the children who wear designer labels to those of all means. ''At Target we've been noticing the rise of the fashion-conscious little girl size 4 to 6,'' said Anne Cashill, a trend manager for Target, the fast-growing stylish discount chain. ''We started a brand for that group about two years ago called Exhilaration. We take a lot of the exact styles from women's ready-to-wear and present them for kids. We had tentative expectations, but the same styles that are hot for women are hot for kids.'' **********She is not talking about matching mother-daughter plaid skirts here either. Among the winners this year, Ms. Cashill points to embroidered jeans, a craze that was created by Tom Ford, the Gucci designer. **********Educators have noticed that style awareness starts very young these days. To counter this trend, a lot of  schools have started requiring uniforms. But even at schools where children must dress the same, teachers say children are still highly clothes-minded. **********''Oh, they're fashion conscious,'' Rita K. Graves, a first-grade teacher said of her charges at Edgar Allan Poe Elementary School in Houston, where all children must wear khaki or white pants or skirts and button-down shirts. ''I had one little girl tell me she wanted me to be her teacher because she liked my boots'' by Nine West. ''She kept asking me when I was going to wear my boots. I told her I'd try to wear them more often.'' **********Perhaps in an era when children prefer the preternaturally cynical Rug Rats to long-beloved figures like Mickey Mouse, such early fashion acumen should not come as a surprise. The recent explosion of TV programming for preteen-agers, including ''Party of Five'' and ''Dawson's Creek,'' and magazines like Teen People are adding to a cultural milieu in which grade-school children abandon all sorts of emblems of childhood -- Barbie dolls, for example -- much more quickly than a generation ago. **********Naturally enough, the design houses argue that the children are driving the trend. ''It used to be that the only decision 4-  to 7-year-olds made was to refuse to wear stuff,'' said Todd Howard, president of the children's wear division of Tommy Hilfiger. ''Now, between TV, magazines and the Internet, they are voting for brands. By the time they are 6 or 7, they are talking about brands in school, and by the time they are 9 to 10 they are making all the decisions. And Mom and Dad's involvement is just paying.'' **********Patti Cohen, a spokeswoman for Donna Karan, agreed. ''These 7-year-olds are going on 30,'' she said. ''A lot of them have their own sense of style.'' To make the point, she refers to some of the child stars Donna Karan has recently dressed for press appearances. Jake Lloyd, the child star of the summer movie blockbuster ''Star Wars: Episode I,'' she said, ''likes track pants, oversized tops and lots of layers.'' **********To some extent the market for designer goods is increasing because the entire children's market is growing. In what is being called the echo baby-boom, a record 53.2 million children will enter the nation's classrooms this fall. Plenty of no-frill retailers, Wal-Mart, for example, are doing just fine selling them plain blue jeans and colored cotton shirts. But according to NPD Group, a Long Island-based market researcher, speciality retailers that emphasize fashion are taking market share from price-oriented discounters. **********Part of the reason style is winning converts is heavy ad campaigns aimed right at young consumers by fashion-forward chains like Old Navy and print campaigns by designers like Tommy Hilfiger and Donna Karan. That is also part of the problem, according to Kay Hymowitz, the author of ''Ready or Not: How Treating Children as Small Adults Endangers Their Future -- and Ours.'' **********''We are seeing the deliberate teening of childhood,'' Ms. Hymowitz said. ''Parents are giving their kids a lot more choices on what to wear at ever younger ages. The advertisers know this, and they are exploiting the kids longing to seem sophisticated and grown-up.'' **********A result, she warns, is a loss of a precious period of independence from conformity. **********''One of the great things about childhood in the U.S. used to be that kids were protected by the market and allowed to grow their own ideas,'' she said. ''Now there is no time to be a kid separate from those pressures. You may have always had kids who are little princesses, but now there are 8-year-old boys that are extremely uptight if they don't get the right Abercrombie & Fitch sweat shirt.''"

More than 40 major drug companies said the law infringed on their patent rights. Alan F. Holmer, president of an organization representing the drug companies, said a senior South African official had assured him that the law would soon be changed. **********The companies have been trying for two years to persuade South Africa to change the law. Mr. Holmer said that the South African Health Minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, had said the bill would be redrafted next year. The law covers all drugs, but the focus of the dispute has been on AIDS drugs, because they are especially expensive and South Africa has been ravaged by the disease. **********The 1997 law had two provisions aimed at bringing down drug prices. One sought to take advantage of a kind of gray market by allowing the import of drugs from countries where they may be available for less, even though unlicensed by the companies that hold the patents. **********The second provision, called compulsory licensing, would let the South African Government license local manufacturers to make their own generic versions. **********The pharmaceutical companies objected strongly, fearing that the law would erode their patent protections. They have pushed for help both from Congress and the White House, even raising the possibility of economic sanctions against South Africa. **********The complex trade issue has proved a problem for Mr. Gore, who had represented the drug companies' point of view in talks with South Africa. **********He has been confronted at campaign appearances by protesters accusing him of heartlessness toward AIDS sufferers in South Africa. **********Industry officials have said that the dispute has blocked efforts to find other ways to reduce the cost of AIDS drugs in South Africa. **********An estimated 6 million of South Africa's 44 million people are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS."

In the telecommunications industry, unlike some other areas of high technology, there is still room for small players to grow big. **********A handful of American companies are doing just that, notably Qwest Communications International Inc. and Level 3 Communications. They are rapidly building fiber-optic networks that will transmit more data faster and cheaper than anyone just a few years ago, let alone Alexander Graham Bell a century ago, could have imagined. **********Global Crossing Ltd., which is based in Bermuda and plans to merge with the regional operator US West Inc., is enjoying similar growth. Its brief history illustrates the fabulous returns possible in this new market. **********Just two years ago, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert bond trader, Gary Winnick, snapped up AT&T's undersea cable-laying business for $750 million, including his own $15 million stake, which has become a roughly 25 percent stake in Global Crossing valued at more than $6 billion. Global Crossing is now valued at $20 billion, thanks to a sevenfold appreciation in its share price since the initial public offering in August. **********Of course, AT&T and the other giants โ including the so-called Baby Bells, Sprint Corp. and MCI WorldCom Inc. โ are no longer sitting on the sidelines. Despite the billions of dollars committed to traditional telecom networks, AT&T, especially, has been snapping up cable networks in a bid to expand into Internet-inspired network technology. **********Still, analysts are most enthusiastic about both Qwest and Level 3, betting that their head start as suppliers of cheap bandwidth will enable them to thrive. Shares in both companies have soared since their initial public offerings: Qwest shares have appreciated sevenfold in two years and Level 3 shares fourfold in one year. **********And it may not be not too late: Most analysts following the companies are still recommending the stocks. **********They were equally bullish on Global Crossing until the US West deal was announced Monday. Standard & Poor's Corp. has since placed its ratings for US West and its regulated subsidiary, US West Communications Inc., on CreditWatch with negative implications. **********Mel Marten, a telecom analyst at Edward Jones in Chicago, advises clients to sell shares in US West, warning in a research note that the deal does not make sense. **********""This merger fails to offer US West additional services that would enhance its relationship with existing customers,"" Mr. Marten said. ""The two companies lack enough operational similarities to induce significant cost-savings."" **********The fourth contender in this market, IXC Communications Inc., elicits little enthusiasm. Disappointing earnings and revenues have discouraged investors and shares have languished. Company executives complain that investors do not appreciate its long-term potential, focusing on the earnings of its established network instead of on its developing Internet services. **********Analysts remain unconvinced. David Barden of J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded the stock last week, saying that a takeover did not look imminent following IXC's rejection of a number of offers. But he still rates it a long-term ""buy."" **********Qwest and Level 3, it appears, can do no wrong in the eyes of investors. Qwest expects to complete its 18,500-mile (29,600-kilometer) national fiber-optic network by the end of June. It is negotiating with 48 of the Fortune 50 companies and 300 other major companies and government agencies, and is already offering advanced network and application services. **********Like Global Crossing, Qwest has struck a deal with a regional operator: BellSouth Corp. owns 10 percent of Qwest, and many analysts expect BellSouth to make a full bid in a year or two. **********Qwest is working with KPN NV of the Netherlands to build and operate a high-capacity European fiber-optic network. About 2,000 miles of the 9,100-mile network is complete. Qwest also has nearly completed a 1,400-mile network in Mexico. **********Level 3 is ahead of schedule in building its international Internet Protocol network. It combines local, long-distance and undersea networks in the United States, Europe and Asia. The U.S. intercity portion is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2001."

Putin made his threat, a spokesman for the Chechen government in Moscow was quoted on radio as saying that if Russia attacks Chechnya, Chechen forces are ready to make ''Russian helicopters drop from the sky like rain.'' **********The tough line from Mr. Putin, who was named to his job on Monday by President Boris N. Yeltsin, suggests that Moscow is ready to set aside shaky hopes for an improvement in relations with Chechnya for a military victory against a group of Chechnya-based Islamic insurgents in Dagestan. **********Late last week, Chechen commandos crossed the mountainous border into Dagestan and occupied several villages, setting off Russia's worst crisis in the Caucasus since the end of the 1994-96 war against Chechnya. That war ended in a humiliating defeat for Russian forces, and the de facto independence of Chechnya. **********Since then, various attempts have been made to normalize Moscow's relations with Chechnya, which is technically still part of the Russian Federation. But preparations for a meeting between the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, and Mr. Yeltsin have repeatedly stalled, in part because of the continuous changes in the Russian Government. **********Mr. Maskhadov, a moderate separatist whose authority at home has been undercut by militant Chechen field commanders and their Islamic allies, has repeatedly warned Moscow not to drag Chechnya into the Dagestan conflict. He has disclaimed any responsibility for the raids launched into Dagestan. **********At a news conference in Tomsk, in Siberia, Mr. Putin told reporters that the Russian military offensive in Dagestan was progressing ''positively'' and that a final ''assault'' was under way. **********As he took office early this week, Mr. Putin said the military campaign, conducted by troops from both the Defense and Interior Ministries, would be completed successfully within two weeks. **********Asked today whether Russian forces would pursue the commandos back to their bases in Chechnya, Mr. Putin, the former chief of Russia's domestic intelligence agency, answered without hesitation: ''Strikes will be delivered on the militants' bases. Chechnya is Russian territory, and strikes will be delivered wherever militants are located, Chechnya or no Chechnya.'' **********Chechen reports that Russian forces had already crossed into the republic -- on land as well as by air -- were denied today by the Defense Ministry in Moscow. **********Within days of seizing several villages in two regions along the Chechen border inside Dagestan, an Islamic council led by Shamil Basayev, a Chechen militant regarded at home as a hero in the war against Russia, declared Dagestan an independent Islamic state and vowed to drive all ''infidels'' out. **********Chechen separatists have long set unification with Dagestan -- a province the size of Austria and home to more than 30 ethnic groups -- as one of their goals, giving the landlocked Chechen republic a gateway to the Caspian Sea. **********Russian and Dagestani officials reported today that Russian forces had driven the militants out of one region and captured a rebel weapons depot. Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, the commander of Interior Ministry troops, said that the first phase of the operation to clear rebels out of the Tsumadin area was over, and that a new phase would begin in the Botlikh region, where the insurgents are said to control 7 out of some 30 villages, on Sunday. **********According to news reports, Russian forces have occupied the main town in the Botlikh district but are surrounded by heavily armed rebel outposts on mountaintops. The newspaper Izvestia reported today that the commandos might have drawn their opponents into a trap, although NTV, Russia's largest independent television channel, said tonight that plans are ready to take out the mountain strongholds. **********According to Izvestia, the press service for the Defense and Interior Ministries confirmed that four Russian helicopters had been destroyed and an SU-24 fighter plane damaged in the fighting. Four top military officers were wounded when their helicopter was struck, the newspaper said. **********Dagestani authorities, who called in federal forces, have distributed arms to local militias, but according to television reports, the Dagestani volunteers have not been involved in the fighting, which has mostly involved air strikes and tank fire. Most of the civilians in the contested villages either fled or were evacuated. **********Casualty reports are conflicting, with the Russian Government claiming 200 rebels killed since the start of the fighting, and Chechen reports saying that only 5 guerrillas have been killed and 15 wounded. Moscow has confirmed 11 dead on its side, while a spokesman for the insurgents said that 60 federal troops had been killed. **********Federal reinforcements continued to arrive in Dagestan today. **********According to Dagestani authorities, one of the wounded was Khattab, a commando leader and an ally of Mr. Basayev who is believed to have been born in Jordan and who has set up military training camps in Chechnya. **********So far, the outside reaction to the fighting in Dagestan has been muted. **********In a statement today the Finnish Government, which now holds the presidency of the European Union, expressed concern about the widening of the conflict and cautioned the Russian authorities about using force. **********It also condemned the ''occupation of villages by armed groups'' and reaffirmed Russia's ''territorial integrity.'' **********But it is just this sort of internal warfare -- and the West's response to it -- that the Moscow Government has feared since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Russia's aversion to what it considers outside interference in its internal security issues was one factor in its strong initial opposition to NATO's intervention in Kosovo, which the Government feared could be seen as a precedent in places like Chechnya."

His trial, which began in 1997, was the longest and most expensive in France's modern history. It forced the country to confront a part of its past that many had tried to forget. **********As the court made its ruling today, officials scrambled to explain Mr. Papon's escape. Despite his conviction, nothing was done to restrict his movements. He was even allowed to keep his passport. **********The Justice Minister, Elisabeth Guigou, said Mr. Papon had benefited from a legal loophole in being released from jail during trial because of poor health. The release, she said, removed any legal basis for controlling his movements. She promised to submit legislation in January to close the loophole. **********Speculation about where Mr. Papon had gone continued throughout the day. Swiss officials confirmed that he was in Martigny, in western Switzerland, last week. **********Under French law, defendants who do not turn themselves in to begin serving their sentences automatically lose the right to appeal. This morning the prosecutor, Bruno Cotte, urged no exception for Mr. Papon. **********''Maurice Papon, who has deliberately chosen not to turn himself in, using the press to create a sort of indecent and invidious aura of suspense, must now see the common law applied,'' Mr. Cotte argued. **********The court broke with its usual protocol and allowed Mr. Papon's lawyers to make their arguments for a delay. But at 5 P.M. it rejected the arguments, ruling that Mr. Papon lost his right of appeal when he failed to report to prison. The ruling closes the door on any further appeals. **********Mr. Papon's chief lawyer, Jean-Marc Varaut, said after the hearing that the court ruling justified Mr. Papon's decision to flee. He said he would try to take the case before the European Court of Human Rights to condemn the French courts. ''We have no other choice,'' he said."

''Even after attending their analysts' meeting today, I'm still not sure whether they can really justify the costs.'' **********She suggested that the purchase was a defensive one. If one of the world's two tobacco giants, Philip Morris or British American Tobacco, had acquired the business, Japan Tobacco would have faced a grim future. **********But the purchase still leaves Japan Tobacco a distant third in the global tobacco market, excluding cigarette manufacturers controlled by the Chinese Government. The acquisition will bring Japan Tobacco's sales to 460 billion cigarettes this year, but Philip Morris sold 945 billion last year while British American Tobacco sold 929 billion. **********Japan Tobacco's domestic business has matured, and given Japan's aging population, the market is likely to shrink in coming years. The company's market share has slipped to 70 percent since the Government privatized the business in 1985, and while the company has made inroads into South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian markets, it has had trouble breaking into Western markets. **********The Government, which created a tobacco monopoly near the turn of the century to finance wars with China and then Russia, still owns a substantial majority of Japan Tobacco, although it has plans to sell more of its shares later this year. The company remains a fount of cash for the Government, providing billions of dollars in taxes every year. **********The RJR purchase brings access to Western Europe, where RJR controls 6 percent of the market; Eastern Europe, where it has a 12 percent share, and Canada, where it has 13 percent of the market. **********With the deal, Japan Tobacco also gets a larger share of the lucrative ''American blend'' cigarette market. The company will become the second-largest global manufacturer of such cigarettes, which use different types of tobacco and flavors and are consumed in the United States and most of Western Europe. **********And while the company has tried to diversify in recent years, moving into pharmaceuticals and other areas, 98 percent of its revenue still comes from tobacco sales. ''Tobacco is clearly Japan Tobacco's core business, and the company has been trying to enter the overseas market and finding it takes a long time to establish brand names and sales and production networks,'' said Yoko Fujii, a tobacco analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. **********Although Ms. Fujii said she thought Japan Tobacco had paid too much, she said the purchase was probably a good one in the long run. **********She noted that Japan Tobacco, like most cigarette companies, was cash rich. ''They will also have to dispose of some of their securities portfolio, and that's a good thing because they're not making much money on those holdings,'' Ms. Fujii said."

Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that the officials have made a ''virtue out of a necessity'' -- that they have decided not to intervene because the effort to restrain the yen hasn't worked. **********Why hasn't it? Because institutional investors around the world have been rushing to get back into the Japanese stock market. And so they buy yen -- which pushes up its value -- to buy Japanese stocks. **********Tokyo ''won't do anything unless the Nikkei collapses,'' said Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston, referring to Japan's marquee stock index. **********The Japanese stock market has already been very, very good to American investors who have bet on it this year. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 30.8 percent, while the broader Topix index has jumped 37.9 percent. And the recent rally of the yen has turned earlier currency losses into small gains that have added to the return from the stock market. Since its low for the year on May 20, the yen is up 11.6 percent. Together, the Nikkei and the yen have produced a gain of 24.7 percent in the last two months for American investors. **********If there has been a change in policy, the yen, which finished the week at 111.42 to the dollar, could get stronger, which would only add to the combined returns for investors as yen investments become worth more in dollar terms. Ms. Parker thinks the yen could soon move to 105 to 108 to the dollar. (As the yen strengthens, it takes fewer to buy a dollar.) **********But a stronger yen could become a problem. It makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad, cutting into sales. And if Japan's export rebound is tripped up, the economic recovery that was suggested in first-quarter economic data may be derailed. **********The Bank of Japan's attempts in June and July to restrain the rising yen were based on this fear. And, as many analysts note, the rallies of the stock market and the yen have both come on very little in the way of positive economic news. **********Yet investors don't seem worried. Even while the yen has been rallying, the Nikkei has rebounded from its summer slide and now is just 435 points -- or 2.4 percent -- from its 1999 high of 18,532.58. **********Elizabeth J. Allan, senior vice president at Scudder Kemper Investments and a former Japanese fund manager, is among the sanguine. Many Japanese companies have business plans based on a yen around 110 to 115 to the dollar, she said, adding, ''around these levels, it is not a big deal in relation to their earnings estimates.'' **********In addition, Ms. Allan said she thought many new investors in Japan were not just looking for quick profits in the stock market. ''There seems to be a lot of buying out there, and a lot of it seems to be long-term, patient money,'' she said. **********The patience of these investors will be tested in early September. That is when data on second-quarter economic growth will be released. First-quarter growth of 1.9 percent was a big surprise, and many economists think it overstated the recovery in Japan. The fresh data will give an indication if the trend is continuing or fizzling. An unexpectedly weak number would undermine stocks. **********A TEST of Japanese intentions ought to come sooner. Since the end of 1996, the yen has not breached 110 to the dollar. If that level is passed without Japanese intervention, then it will be clear that policy in Tokyo has changed. **********Japanese officials will threaten intervention, as they did on Friday. But after a while, that won't count if they don't actually do anything. **********Richard Medley, president of Medley Global Advisors, a consultant to hedge funds and investment houses, said the Japanese have to intervene now to slow the yen's rise. If they don't, and if the second-quarter economic data are disappointing, there may be a destabilizing selloff in the yen -- and the stock market may follow it down. **********''Its a very tough period,'' Mr. Medley said."

Some analysts who had feared Fed policy makers, at their meeting at the end of this month, would make the first of perhaps multiple rate increases suddenly expressed doubts that there will be any rises. **********''That the C.P.I. was positive on all fronts got things going in earnest,'' said Joseph Battipaglia, investment policy chairman at Gruntal & Company, adding that a second factor in yesterday's market surge was the Oracle Corporation's surprisingly strong sales and profit report after the market closed on Tuesday. **********Shares of Oracle, the biggest database software maker, jumped 71 3/16, to 32 15/16, as brokerage and bank issues joined computer-related stocks as the day's biggest gainers. **********The Nasdaq composite index soared 103.16 points, or 4.27 percent, to 2,517.83, surpassing its 96.05-point jump on Feb. 11 to claim the record as the most points ever. The percentage rise was the biggest this year and the seventh biggest on record. **********Other major gauges also posted substantial gains -- in contrast to their frequent tendency recently to move in opposite directions from the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones industrial average, with many blue-chip components sensitive to the business cycle, rose 189.96 points, or 1.79 percent, to close at 10,784.95. This put it ahead 17.46 percent for the year, but it was still 2.9 percent shy of its record of 11,107.19 reached May 13. **********The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, a benchmark for many professional money managers, climbed 29.25 points, or 2.25 percent, to finish at 1,330.41, putting it up 8.23 percent so far in 1999. The index had an unprecedented string of gains of more than 20 percent a year from 1995 through 1998. **********Perhaps inspired by the United States performance, Mexico's chief stock index leaped 6.2 percent, while Brazil's Bovespa was 4.12 percent higher. European markets, which had less time to react to the C.P.I. and other Government reports here, finished with moderate gains. **********The bond market advanced, driving interest rates down by as much as one-tenth of a point. Most analysts said they still expected the Federal Reserve to lift the overnight lending rate by one-quarter point, to 5 percent, on June 30. **********''Everyone kind of expects that's still to come,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. But, he said, the C.P.I. report at least ''raises some doubt'' about this. He noted, for example, that since early October bond yields have already risen 50 percent relative to commodity prices, which have actually retreated. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is to discuss monetary policy today before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. **********J. P. Morgan posted the biggest advance among the Dow 30, surging 6 points, to 134. American Express, up 4 15/16, to 124, was the third-biggest contributor. Financial stocks are particularly sensitive to interest-rate changes, which affect lending volume, spreads between borrowing and lending costs, holdings of derivatives and, in the case of brokers, trading activity that tends to shrink in weak markets. **********Chase Manhattan climbed 5 1/4, to 80 3/8; Citigroup 2 5/16, to 46 1/16; Merrill Lynch 5 3/8, to 72 15/16; Charles Schwab  7 3/4, to 89 1/8, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 5 3/16, to 93 1/16. **********In technology, I.B.M. climbed 4 13/16 to 120 11/16; Hewlett-Packard 4 5/16, to 90 3/4; America Online 11 3/4, to 106 1/2; Microsoft 3 5/16 to 81; Ebay 13 1/4, to 148 3/4, and Amazon.com 15 3/16, to 111 11/16. Despite downbeat comments by some analysts, Pfizer advanced 1 9/16, to 99 1/8, its second straight rise following six declines. Merck rose 1, to 68 5/8, in an otherwise restrained drug group. **********Oil stocks and those of oil service companies were prominently weak, with Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Phillips each down more than a point and Halliburton down 2 1/4 after hitting a 52-week high and Schlumberger down 2.

The results were in line with analysts' expectations. **********Little improvement is expected in the near term. The company warned that it would continue to face intense price pressure from rivals in the next quarter. **********Other European airlines are also expected to post lower earnings for the quarter in coming days because of weaker profit on North Atlantic routes. KLM Royal Dutch, the only other airline to report so far, said last week that its operating profit fell 53 percent because excess capacity drove down prices and revenue. **********British Airways said it planned to cut capacity by up to 12 percent over the next three years as it weeds out unprofitable routes to places like Jakarta, Indonesia, and Pittsburgh. Most of the routes to be cut are short-haul flights in Europe. The airline will also adjust its routes, eliminating or limiting service to more than one airport serving the same city like flights to London at Gatwick and Heathrow airports. **********''Our strategy of reducing capacity is ahead of target, and through our fleet and network changes, British Airways will emerge from current market conditions with lower costs and a younger aircraft fleet focused on the profitable sections of the market,'' the chief executive of British Airways, Robert Ayling, said in a statement. **********Analysts said the service cutbacks had been expected; British Airways said last year that it planned to eliminate flights with extra capacity. **********''This is everyday housekeeping,'' said Andrew Light, a European airline analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ''The big news is that it has been accelerated.'' **********British Airways said its yield, or average revenue per passenger, fell 5.8 percent in the first quarter. By using smaller planes with fewer seats, it hopes to increase its yield by 28 percent. The company wants to eliminate extra economy-class seats while keeping or increasing first-class and business-class seating. **********As part of the overhaul, British Airways said it planned to invest $:6 billion, or $9.6 billion, on improving services. It will refurbish its Concorde planes, redesign the planes' interiors, and build a new lounge at Heathrow for Concorde fliers."

The case provided a rare, high-profile instance of encouragement to women, who have traditionally been reluctant to bring sexually related complaints to court. **********Mr. Yokoyama won re-election comfortably in April. But public opinion swiftly turned against him after the young campaign worker won a settlement in a civil suit. She contended that three days before the April election, he had draped a blanket over her and himself in the back seat of a campaign vehicle and  groped her. **********He conceded draping the blanket over the two of them but denied any impropriety, saying it was because she was sick and he was cold. **********Local groups, angered at the apparent contradiction between his strong denials and his quick agreement to pay $107,000 in fines in the civil suit, mobilized to demand his resignation. **********''Until Yokoyama was forced to pay a large amount of money, most people weren't sure whether to side with the governor or the young woman,'' said Mizuho Fukushima, a  member of the upper house of Parliament. ''But once he paid up, most people in Japan concluded that he was guilty, and public opinion shifted against him strongly.'' **********Yoriko Madoka, another member of the upper house and a prominent feminist, said: ''This indictment must be considered a major step forward for women's rights in Japan.  In the past in Japan, sexual harassment and rape victims typically ended up being treated like the accused.'' **********The university student will probably remain an anonymous hero for many women because the courts systematically shield the victim from public exposure. **********But she was quoted as saying that she was unhappy with the outcome of the case. ''Fundamentally, I am not satisfied with his manner of resignation,'' she said in a statement published by the newspaper Sankei Shimbun. ''For me, I wanted him to apologize earlier, reflect on what he had done, and then resign.'' **********In a telephone interview, the student's lawyer, Eri Shimao, said that her client's case had been helped immeasurably by her forthrightness. ''I think the person who filed the lawsuit had compelling testimony,'' she said. ''There were no contradictions in her statement, and that gave her high credibility.'' **********Mr. Yokoyama has been unavailable for comment since checking into an Osaka hospital late Monday, soon after the police raided his offices. In previous interviews, though, he has insisted on his innocence. **********Several women's groups and lawyers who deal frequently with sexual harassment issues said the case  would provide powerful encouragement to other women to step forward and bring charges against men who have harassed them. **********The term sexual harassment entered into usage in Japan only 10 years ago, after a famous case was brought in the southern city of Fukuoka. Until recently, women were only very slowly beginning to feel secure enough to come forward to make harassment complaints. **********In the last couple of years, however, for reasons that are not entirely clear, that has begun to change, and lawyers who specialize in such matters say the number of women going to court over harassment has been growing rapidly."

Some American experts have made similar criticisms of the report's conclusions on matters that are still under debate among intelligence specialists. **********''Cox and his like, using the same base and shabby methods as those used by Joseph McCarthy in the 1950's, have managed to plunge every overseas Chinese in the United States into a state of extreme nervousness and anxiety,'' the article said. **********A separate commentary appearing today on the front page of the People's Daily, the prime voice of the Communist Party, expressed the dark view of American foreign policy that seems to be taking hold here in response to the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia and the accidental attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. **********Today's article said that the United States ''is launching a new cold war against socialist countries and the third world.'' **********China calls the NATO campaign an illegal intervention in the affairs of a sovereign country. Officials here are especially worried by NATO's sidestepping of the United Nations, where China has veto power in the Security Council, and by the setting of a precedent that could be used to justify foreign interventions in crises over Taiwan or Tibet. **********Today's is the latest in a series of  People's Daily editorials that harshly portray American global intentions. **********These recent appraisals of the United States as a major threat to China contrast sharply with the hopes for a ''constructive strategic partnership'' that were constantly voiced here last year.

The company was expected to earn 57 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by First Call. Revenue fell 15 percent, to $29.7 billion from $35.1 billion. **********Though it surpassed estimates, Exxon's profit fell more than in other quarters of 1998. Exxon offset some of the effect of falling oil prices in the first half with better earnings from fuel and chemical sales. Worldwide inventories of chemicals, gasoline and heating oil made that impossible in the fourth quarter. **********''You name it, nearly every single factor that could impact their earnings was down,'' said Paul Cheng of Lehman Brothers in New York. **********Exxon said net income for the year was $6.37 billion, down 25 percent from a record level in 1997. This was Exxon's lowest profit since 1994 and broke a string of three increases in annual earnings. **********Other big oil companies are expected to report larger drops in quarterly earnings than Exxon's. Mobil, which Exxon is buying for $80 billion, is expected to have a 50 percent drop in profit, and an 80 percent decline is predicted for Texaco. **********Mobil said today that it expected about $4.8 billion in capital expenditures this year, down 11 percent from 1998, because of low oil prices. It said it spent about $5.4 billion last year, 8.5 percent less than the $5.9 billion originally budgeted. Low crude oil prices have led Mobil and other companies to cut costs by dismissing workers and limiting exploration. **********Exxon and Mobil said their deal would save $2.8 billion a year by cutting 9,000 jobs from a combined work force around 122,000 and through other measures. Exxon said in November that this year's capital spending would likely be equal to or less than the $10 billion of 1998. **********Combined, Exxon and Mobil spent $15.4 billion on capital projects last year. The new company will cut $1.5 billion from capital spending, Exxon said at the time of the agreement."

Many analysts expect Internet technology to become one of the main means for carrying phone calls as more communications companies focus their networks on Internet-based data, audio and video applications. **********''In order to attract eyeballs and to provide more products and services, we decided to give Delta 3 the ability to do financing on their own,'' Itzhak Fisher, RSL's chief executive, said on Friday. **********RSL, which is registered in Bermuda but has its operating headquarters in New York, is a small but fast-growing company focused on selling international communications to small and medium-sized business customers. The letters RSL are the initials of the company's controlling shareholder, Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir. RSL's shares, which trade in the Nasdaq market, closed on Friday at $32.75, up 87.5 cents a share. **********Mr. Fisher would not say how much money the company hoped to raise in the offering, but RSL plans to offer 20 percent of the Internet telephony operation to the public and to retain the rest. **********RSL plans to file registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission by next month and to offer Delta 3 shares to the public in the third quarter. **********So far, the Net2Phone unit of the publicly held IDT Corporation, based in Hackensack, N.J., is considered the biggest Internet telephony operation. IDT has not announced any plans to issue separate stock for Net2Phone. Most of the other Internet phone companies are small and still private, which would position the Delta 3 offering as perhaps the first ''pure play'' investment in Internet telephony. **********But the business case for Internet telephony is in flux. In the past,  transmitting international phone calls using Internet technology was profitable because carriers could avoid the high tariffs levied by many foreign countries on traditional phone calls. The arbitrage between high tariffs on normal phone calls and no or low tariffs on Internet communications enabled Internet-based companies to undercut traditional carriers and still make money. Sensing this opportunity, RSL acquired a controlling stake in Delta 3 in 1997 and the entire company last year. **********But those foreign phone fees are coming down, partly as a result of global trade agreements, and the arbitrage opportunity is fading. **********So RSL has been trying to reposition Delta 3 as something other than a bargain-basement option for budget-sensitive consumers. (The sound quality of Internet phone calls, while improving, still does not generally equal that of traditional calls.) The new goal is to become an integrated provider of voice communications over the World Wide Web. **********''In a world that is deregulating that fast, where the cost structure is going so rapidly down, the ability to use I.P. as an arbitrage opportunity is going away,'' Mr. Fisher said, referring to Internet Protocol, the language of cyberspace. ''It has worked for us for the last two years very well and it will continue to work for us in some countries. But now we will be offering value-added services.'' **********Among the services Delta 3 aims to provide are phone calls from computers and billing on the Web. **********Last week, RSL announced quarterly financial results that were better than most analysts had expected. The company reported a loss of $57 million, or $1.08 a share. But the consensus prediction of Wall Street analysts had been for a loss of $1.30 a share. Revenue more than doubled, to $340.3 million from $131.6 million in the first quarter of last year."

Legal experts and United Nations officials said they were unaware of X-ray age checks being used in immigration enforcement elsewhere. **********Combating a surge of illegal immigration attempts, naval and air patrols off Australia's northwest coast  have so far this month intercepted a record 10 Indonesian boats trying to land 872 passengers -- mostly from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan -- in remote places. **********Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock says that as many as 10,000 people from those countries are preparing to try to enter Australia illegally by paying agents in Indonesia. **********''We are facing the biggest ever assault on our borders by unauthorized arrivals,'' he said recently. **********Since July, about 1,700 have been arrested at sea off the northern coasts of this island continent, most in vessels with Indonesian crews. **********Australian officials monitoring the growing traffic in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, say that about 2,000 Iraqi, Afghan and Iranian citizens are waiting there to board fishing boats and small freighters for the 2,500-mile island-hopping voyage. **********Australia is almost the size of the United States but has a population of only 19 million, 25 percent of them born overseas in more than 100 countries. It is is admitting 80,000 migrants this year from about 50 countries on the basis of skills, family links or refugee status. **********Legal immigration processing can take two years or more. **********Government policy is to deport illegal entrants who are without refugee claims and to detain the others, sometimes for years, while their pleas for asylum are examined or contested in the courts, to which such claimants have free access here. **********Although air detection and naval arrest is catching most illegal migrants before they land, this seems to deter few smugglers or the clients,  who reportedly pay up to $8,000 for ''packages'' combining air fares to Jakarta, transit accommodation and then a one-way boat ticket. **********The month, legislation was introduced in the federal Parliament to authorize patrols to intercept suspect boats in international waters. **********A second proposal is to deny permanent residence to those who enter  illegally, even those who have valid claims for refugee status."

Platt, the outgoing Hewlett-Packard chairman. Working like a consultant, she is hired by lawyers and in most cases conducts prison interviews and searches some of the Midwest's most violent neighborhoods for mitigating factors to save inmates from execution. **********As far as I can remember, I was fascinated with true-crime books. As soon as I realized there was a career in understanding why people commit murder, I knew that is what I wanted to do. **********I have been doing mitigation since 1993. The thing that amazes me is meeting a person who is charged with a horrible offense, and they almost always seem very human. My job is to find the hurt, vulnerable, sad or angry side of the person, and to argue that they need help, not execution. I gather all the factors and try to understand why my clients were in a gang, why they participated in a murder, why their sexual deviance made them kill someone. **********There are nearly 400 people on death row just in Illinois. I have about 20 cases at the moment, all over the Midwest. I work on my own. I charge $60 an hour for state cases, $70 for federal, but because the money comes from the public defender's budget, the judge sometimes caps my income. The hardest part is I don't get paid until the case is closed, and some cases have gone on since 1995. One case I have already spent over 1,000 hours on. I am owed about $60,000. **********Some days are very, very difficult. Some of the worst housing projects I know like the back of my hand. I am white and most of my clients are black or Hispanic. Last year, I was on death row in Pontiac, Mich., the day after an execution, and everyone was grieving; even the guards were so sad. I also do a lot of work in very, very bad neighborhoods. Often I send out my bill and think, I don't know that this compensates me for what it has taken out of me emotionally. **********I would not say I am against the death penalty. But until we have a fairer way of dealing out death sentences, I don't think there is enough caution. Sometimes, my findings have influenced the fate of a defendant. In one recent case in Decatur, Ill. -- a gang fight that went bad and resulted in a shooting death -- the jury recommended against sentencing the killer to death, partly because of the testimony of a former teacher I found. **********A couple of times I have felt really threatened. My first-ever client started talking to me about how he could easily overpower me. Another client who is very disturbed and paranoid, with icy blue eyes, had staring contests with me. I am about the same age as most of my clients, so they are very curious about the differences in our lives. I tell them up-front that I am married, that I have two dogs and we are renovating an old house in Chicago. That makes them open up about their own lives. **********People ask whether I worry about burning out. I don't. I would rather give 100 percent for 20 years than 50 percent until I retire. A part of me would like to do interior decorating. Another part wants to do active parenting. Right now, this is what I love. **********Correction: January 4, 200, Tuesday  The My Job column in the Workplace section on Wednesday about Caryn Platt Tatelli, a death row investigator, misstated the location of one death row she described. It is in Pontiac, Ill., not Pontiac, Mich. The column also misstated the number of people on death row in Illinois. It is 161, not nearly 400."

North Korea is developing missiles that could threaten Japan or South Korea. Ethnic strife is on the rise in politically tense Indonesia. **********As it happens, though, none of these flashpoints caused the bumpy ride in Asia's markets. Instead, shareholders from Seoul to Singapore were thrown into a tizzy by a team of anonymous number-crunchers in Geneva, who made changes in a closely watched Asian stock index. **********That a stock index could exert so much influence across so many markets says a lot about the changing nature of investing -- and the herd mentality of investors as they venture back into recession-ravaged Asia. **********''It's very hard to find people who think independently about how to invest in Asia,'' said Mac Overton, a former fund manager in Hong Kong. ''They are terrified about underperforming the benchmark.'' **********The benchmark of choice here is the M.S.C.I., which stands for Morgan Stanley Capital International. From its offices in Geneva, this subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter calculates 3,000 stock indexes a day, covering 24,000 stocks in 51 countries. It bundles these country indexes into regional indexes. Analysts say Morgan Stanley's Asian indexes are by far its most influential. **********On Aug. 12, Morgan Stanley announced it would reinstate Malaysia in two of those indexes, the All-Country Far East Free and Emerging Markets Free indexes, as of next February. It had dropped Malaysia last September when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad imposed controls on Malaysia's currency market. **********Morgan Stanley also said it would adjust its portfolios to double the weighting of Taiwan -- a nod to the greater openness of Taiwan's markets. To restore Malaysia and bolster Taiwan, Morgan Stanley will reduce the relative weighting of other Asian countries in the indexes. **********That could be crucial to how much foreign investment flows to these countries. A growing number of overseas funds use these indexes to judge their own performances. When Morgan Stanley changes the weighting of various countries, fund managers rush to align their own portfolios. **********Not surprisingly, the news had a drastic effect on the markets. Stock exchanges in Malaysia and Taiwan soared, while other markets, like Hong Kong and Singapore, swooned. When Morgan Stanley announced a later adjustment that could lift Singapore's weighting, Singapore bounced back. **********The changes are likely to have the most lasting impact on Malaysia, which has been spurned by foreign investors since Dr. Mahathir effectively dug a moat around the country's capital and currency markets. **********''It's a very symbolic step for us,'' said Razak Baginda, the executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a research firm in Kuala Lumpur. ''Having been seen as a pariah state, the Morgan Stanley listing signifies that we are once again a legitimate place to invest.'' **********Executives at Morgan Stanley Capital International said they were well aware of the influence they wield. They seemed the slightest bit sheepish about the market tumult they set off over the last week. **********''It's not our business, strangely enough, to move markets,'' said John Fildes, the executive director of Morgan Stanley Capital International in Hong Kong. ''We aim to be a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator.'' **********Stock indexes are popular in Asia for the same reason they became popular in the United States and Europe. Funds that manage billions of dollars for endowments and pension funds want benchmarks against which to measure their performance. Some funds are bound by their charters not to invest in stocks or countries that are excluded from these indexes. **********But Mr. Fildes said stock indexes have become even more influential here in the aftermath of the regional economic crisis. Burned by the spectacular market meltdowns in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, fund managers are counting on indexes as a way to hedge their bets. **********''When the Asian Tigers were generating high returns, people were not so reliant on the benchmark,'' Mr. Fildes said. ''But the volatility of the last two years has made people much more careful.'' **********In effect, fund managers are substituting the research and analysis of Morgan Stanley for their own judgment. Given Morgan Stanley's vast influence, it is no surprise that its changes have drawn criticism. **********Several experts said it was premature to restore Malaysia to the index, since it was not clear whether the Government would fully eliminate capital controls after they expire on Sept. 1. Officials in Malaysia have said they are unlikely to allow its currency, the ringgit, to trade freely. **********In Taiwan's case, some fund managers said Morgan Stanley should have treated the escalating tensions with China as a disincentive. Others noted that while Taiwan's Government has loosened some restrictions, like foreign ownership of local companies, it still routinely restricts capital flows. **********The changes in the Morgan Stanley index have led to some dubious investment decisions, according to Bill Kaye, the senior managing director of the Pacific Group, a hedge fund in Hong Kong. He noted that the Taiwan market had risen by more than 8 percent since last week despite the fact that Taiwan and China may be edging close to an armed conflict. **********''There is no intelligent basis for that kind of investment whatsoever,'' Mr. Kaye said. ''It's absolutely Byzantine.'' **********Mr. Fildes has spent the last week responding to these criticisms. He noted that Morgan Stanley left open the possibility that it would not reinstate Malaysia if the Government did not phase out capital controls. As for Taiwan, ''political risk is something for a fund manager to decide about,'' he said. **********Still, as Mr. Fildes acknowledged somewhat wearily, ''Any changes in the indexes can be emotive.''"

Yet members of the interim board of the Internet's new oversight body are beginning to make decisions and shape policy that could ultimately affect everyone who uses the global network. **********To finance the $5.9 million annual budget of the oversight body, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, this temporary board has already voted to levy a $1 a year tax on the more than four million Internet addresses, or domain names, that end in .com, .net and .org. The board is also planning to impose tens of thousands of dollars in licensing and other fees on companies that want to get into the business of dispensing Internet addresses. And recently, the board endorsed controversial recommendations for establishing a new global framework for resolving disputes over who can and cannot use certain words in their Internet addresses. **********Esther Dyson, the chairwoman of the interim board, which was set up last year, says the group is simply carrying out its Government-mandated charge to break up the monopoly in Internet name registration and to move Internet governance to the private sector. **********But critics say the board is overstepping its authority and ignoring another mandate -- to create a transparent, bottoms-up organization. Instead, they say, the board is working behind the scenes with powerful international corporate and government interests to create a top-down hierarchy that flies in the face of the free-wheeling, consensus-based spirit that built the Internet. **********Such sentiments are but the latest chapter in yearslong sniping fueled by international jealousies and myriad conspiracy theories. What is different now, some observers say, is that the Internet, which is built on a cooperative technology for routing data around the globe, is in less stable hands -- increasing the risk that angry factions will in effect secede from the network, damaging its integrity by splitting it into several smaller, disconnected networks. **********Although such a split is considered unlikely, anxiety over who is running the show could curb investments in the growing electronic commerce industry. **********''The risks are that Icann has a little bit of authority but very little legitimacy,'' said Bill Whyman, an Internet analyst for the Legg Mason investment company in Washington. ''This is an awkward consensus-building process. If it pushes too far and causes itself to lose support among key constituencies, Icann itself can be undercut. Then you have a very bad situation with no one in control. Then you have a very bad situation for E-commerce.'' **********Icann was created last year by one of the Internet's founding fathers, Jon Postel, as the Clinton Administration moved to complete the privatization of the Internet. The United States Government, which financed the creation of the Internet over several decades, had begun privatizing the network in 1993 by turning over responsibility for domain name registration -- that is, the assigning of Internet addresses -- to a Virginia-based company, Network Solutions. **********But as Network Solutions' lucrative Government-sanctioned monopoly became increasingly controversial, the Administration made it a top priority to introduce competition into the registration business -- while also transferring oversight of the Internet to a private international body. A Commerce Department report last June mapped out the principles and goals for such a body, but few specifics were spelled out. **********Icann was set up as a nonprofit organization by Mr. Postel, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California who for years administered the address numbering system behind Internet domain names. But he died shortly after the interim board was named last fall, turning unanswered questions about how he selected the members into something of a mystery. **********Whatever its origins, the interim board now has nine members -- plus the corporation's temporary president, Michael Rogers. In addition to Ms. Dyson, a well-known Internet analyst, publisher and entrepreneur, the board includes telecommunications executives and academics from the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America. **********And though the interim board had been expected to set up the procedures for building up a broad-based Icann membership that might elect a full-time board, the interim group has itself become a policy-making body. **********Some critics say Icann pushed too far last month in Berlin, when it endorsed in principle recommendations of a report from the World Intellectual Property Organization for cracking down on cybersquatters, the speculators who register and then try to resell popular domain names, and for resolving disputes over who has the right to trademarks registered as Internet addresses. **********The board referred the report to Icann's domain name committee, which is to recommend ways to meet the goals. But to many, the deck seems stacked in favor of big corporations and trademark holders since a key part of that committee -- members representing noncommercial name holders -- has not yet been appointed by the board. In fact, Icann has yet to appoint the at-large members who will elect half of the permanent board. **********Until a board is elected, Icann is largely responsible only to the Commerce Department, which endorsed its creation and is pushing for quick establishment of dispute-resolution mechanisms so that Icann can set up full-scale competition in the registration business. **********''There is a lot of pressure to introduce competition,'' said A. Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor who was on the panel of experts that advised the World Intellectual Property Organization, an arm of the United Nations, in its drafting of the report. **********In response to that pressure, Mr. Froomkin says, voicing a common criticism, Icann is ''going fast on the decision making instead of going faster on doing the setting up'' of an elected board. **********Ms. Dyson, however, says Icann is caught between special interest groups: noisy critics crying for the board to slow down and quieter interests with a large stake in the process, who are insisting that the board move faster, particularly to resolve disputes over domain names and trademarks. **********Among those leading the charge to put the brakes on Icann's policy making is Network Solutions, which built the international registry for top level domains like .com, .net and .org under its exclusive Government contract. It also controls the main server, the so-called root of the Internet, for the global network and built a $25 million shared registry system that is being tested with five companies. The first of those companies, Register.com, will begin competing with Network Solutions today. **********But Network Solutions is still negotiating with the Commerce Department on terms for permanently opening up its registry, the data base of all registered domains, to competitors. And the company has refused to apply to become an official Icann registrar when full-scale competition is opened. The company says Icann's licensing terms give the governance body too much regulatory authority, including the ability to cancel a company's accreditation -- and thus its business -- at whim. **********Network Solutions argues that the interim board should be doing nothing more than setting minimum technical standards for the competing registries. **********''They have turned what is supposed to be a standards-setting body into a regulatory commission,'' said Donald L. Telage, the company's senior vice president. **********Executives from Network Solutions have taken their case to Capitol Hill, where they were working feverishly last week to persuade key members to hold oversight hearings on the actions of both Icann and the Commerce Department. **********Ms. Dyson and Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department adviser  overseeing the formation of Icann, declined to comment on Network Solutions' complaints, citing their continued talks with the company. **********To be sure, Network Solutions has a great incentive to protect its monopoly. But the company is not alone in questioning the interim board's authority for setting permanent policies. **********''It's a real tricky game,'' said Dave Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Internet civil liberties group. ''You may want an interim agreement, but I don't think that the interim board should put in place anything that is not revocable.'' **********He added: ''I believe that the mandate that they were given was to form a stable organization representative in some way or another of a community. I don't think they should be making critical decisions that they don't have to.'' **********The elected board is not expected to be in place until next spring, and Ms. Dyson said she expected that the decision on adding new domains would be delayed until then. She and her board dismiss much of the criticism as merely a continuation of the contentious debate that has been part of this process for three years. But many critics say the board has brought much of the skepticism on itself. **********The paucity of details about how the interim board was created has fostered an Internet conspiracy theory that the board is carrying out a hidden agenda. **********Ms. Dyson takes strong exception to such theories. **********''When they asked me, they did not ask me to do anything in particular,'' she said of her being asked to serve on Icann. ''I do not represent corporate interests; I represent the little guy.'' **********Adding to the mistrust, however, was the board's refusal to hold open board meetings. **********''Whenever you do things in a smoke-filled room,'' Mr. Farber said, ''even if you are the most honest people in the world, people will suspect you are not honest.''"

Solzhenitsyn and other Russian writers who often waited decades before their accounts of Soviet gulags became known to the world, Mr. Pasko's jailhouse diary can be found on one of the country's most frequented Internet sites on political news, http://www.polit.ru/index-dossier/mayday/ **********The texts are a window not only into the arbitrary world of Russian justice, but also into the mind of a man battling to maintain emotional equilibrium. **********''He is a journalist, so he always tries to write about topics that interest him,'' his wife, Galina Morozova, said in a telephone interview from Vladivostok. ''And he spends a lot of time absolutely alone in solitary confinement. The best way to get rid of the solitude is to make some use of your talent and write about it.'' **********A career navy officer and military journalist, Captain Pasko, 37, made a name for himself as an environmental crusader at Boyevaya Vakhta (Battle Watch), the newspaper of Russia's Pacific Fleet. But what really worried the authorities was the freelance work he did for NHK, Japan's largest television network. **********After NHK broadcast a report on Russia's dumping of nuclear waste, the authorities began to clamp down. Captain Pasko was arrested in November 1997 and charged with selling the nation's secrets. **********Amnesty International has designated him a ''prisoner of conscience,'' and other human rights groups have taken up his cause. A verdict in his Pasko's long-running trial, at which the prosecutor is demanding a 12-year prison term, is expected this month. **********When he was hauled into the military courtroom in January, Captain Pasko shouted out, ''We will fight!'' But there is little bravado in his prison essays. **********The first is titled ''Cookie,'' slang for a first-time prisoner. It is a set of survival tips for new prisoners and an informal dissertation on the sociology of Russia's jails. **********Anybody determined to challenge Russia's authorities, Captain Pasko writes, should keep a large bag at home full of provisions, because he can be hauled off to jail at a moment's notice. Essential goods include an electric heater for boiling water, cans of food to compensate for the meager prison rations and a blanket. **********He warns that initial prolonged detention at a police station means threats and beatings, advising new prisoners to adopt the old adage of Soviet spy movies: say nothing and wait to be passed on to the next step in the chain of custody. **********''You have to survive the first 72 hours,'' he writes. ''It's the period when they can keep you there. To extend it they need to obtain special documents and they will have to provide you with a defense attorney.'' **********Friends in the police are no help, merely a hindrance once they sense that the state wants a conviction, he warns. **********''I am sorry for those who have friends in the militia,'' Captain Pasko wrote. ''That means additional evidence against you.'' **********Between interrogations, the prisoner is kept in a ''preliminary confinement cell,'' a cage stuffed with other detainees with a rank toilet in the corner. **********Later they are shifted to ''quarantine,'' where each is photographed, X-rayed and subjected to painful blood tests with a thick needle. **********Then it is on to an overcrowded prison ward where inmates sleep in shifts as their trials drag on. While the prisons are dirty, noisy and pungent, the hardest part is not losing hope, as savvy prisoners forecast the long sentences likely to be handed down, regardless of whether the inmate is innocent or guilty. **********''The memories about the relatively good life you had before, about your wife and children, put a lot of pressure on your mind,'' he said. ''Just bear in mind that from now on you have nothing and nobody: no apartment, no family, no car, no work or rewards. You are nobody.'' **********Still, prisoners must survive, and Captain Pasko offers his own rules of prison etiquette. He recommends that inmates join a ''family,'' a small group of prisoners who try to look out for each other. **********Parcels of food from home should be shared, to ease the strains of coexisting in such close quarters, but prisoners should be careful about sharing clothes, he says. Nothing that is lent will ever be returned. **********Captain Pasko says he donated two sleeves from his sweater, which were used to fashion a crude ''mail rope'' for transmitting notes and small packets of tea and tobacco from cell to cell. But he drew the line at handing over his boots and pants to prisoners who insisted that they merely needed them for a trial appearance the next day. **********The most important rule involves communication. Because cells are rife with informers, a prisoner should never talk about his case. Captain Pasko reports that he became so reticent that he even found it difficult to talk to his own lawyer. **********The Pasko case underscores one of the paradoxes of modern-day Russia. While the collapse of the Soviet state and advent of computer technology has made the draconian censorship of Soviet days all but impossible, the new Russia is also a place where a muckraking reporter can be locked up for 19 months before he is pronounced innocent or guilty. Certainly the prolonged wait seems to have taken its toll on journalists' morale. **********Captain Pasko has spent his recent months in solitary confinement, isolated even from prison family. Despite his messages to the world outside, he appears to have retreated further into himself and lost his zeal for doing battle with the authorities. **********His second prison writing -- excerpts from a book in progress about his experience in solitary confinement -- is grim, metaphysical and fatalistic. Recalling that he bought a copy of the criminal code six months before he was arrested, Captain Pasko muses that his thoughts of jail, not his role as a journalistic gadfly, might have led to his imprisonment. **********''I thought about it, and the thoughts came true,'' he wrote. **********He then briefly dared to hope that he could influence his fate by thinking positively. **********''Perhaps something written by me now will come true,'' he wrote. ''What if I put down something optimistic? No, it will turn out to be false.''"

Final results of the first official count showed that Mr. Montiel took 40.7 percent of the vote, while the closest contender, Jose Luis Duran Reveles of the National Action Party, or PAN, took 34.2 percent. **********A third candidate, Higinio Martinez Miranda, 43, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, polled 21.3 percent. **********The results removed any doubt that the presidential election to be held on July 2, 2000, will be a real contest. The governing party showed that it could win once again. But so could opposition parties, if they joined forces. **********At the same time that the two major opposition parties were going down in defeat in Mexico State, they and two other opposition parties joined in an unlikely 11th-hour coalition to snatch the governor's post from the PRI in the small western coastal state of Nayarit. **********The coalition candidate, Antonio Echevarria, 55, won, with 51.7 percent of the vote. The PRI candidate, Jose Lucas Vallarta Robles, 67, took 42.8 percent, a strong showing that would have allowed him to win easily if the opposition had been divided. **********The day's results sent an unmistakable message that the opposition could greatly improve its chances of taking national power next year for the first time in seven decades by joining forces behind a single candidate. **********But the case of the Nayarit coalition suggests little about whether the opposition can forge an alliance at the national level. In tiny Nayarit, a slow-living desert state with only 557,000 registered voters, the opposition had no strong candidates and almost no following before this year. Its luck changed when Mr. Echevarria, long the state PRI's richest and most savvy strongman and fund-raiser, fell out with the Governor, also from the PRI, and bolted from the party. **********Mr. Echevarria's political ideas, however, had little to do with his success at uniting the opposition behind him. What counted was his sheer pull at the polls. **********''It was about winning power for power's sake,'' said Joaquin Lopez Doriga, a television commentator. **********By contrast, the two major opposition parties both have strong-willed national leaders who are expected to become presidential candidates. Gov. Vicente Fox Quesada of Guanajuato, known for his tough, country-style talk and cowboy boots, will probably run for the National Action Party, a Catholic, business-oriented group. Some recent polls are casting him as the front-runner at this stage. **********Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution won the race for Mayor of Mexico City in 1997 and is widely believed to have triumphed in the presidential vote of 1988, losing it only by fraud. It is hard to imagine the scenario that would see one of them stand graciously down in favor of the other. **********The vote in Mexico State, which borders Mexico City on three sides, also showed a decline in the popularity of Mr. Cardenas's party. It dropped 13 percentage points since the elections in July 1997, when Mr. Cardenas was elected Mayor. **********Party officials argued that the choice of Mr. Martinez, who turned out to be a colorless candidate, may have affected their showing as much as dissatisfaction with Mr. Cardenas's performance. **********The PRI seemed to be using the Mexico State elections to test several of the limits it will face in the big race next year. The party mounted an abrasive but convincing campaign against crime, which has overwhelmed many cities in the state. Mr. Montiel called criminals ''rats'' who did not deserve the protections of human rights. **********Throughout the campaign, PRI party workers used a variety of tactics to pressure voters or reward them for their vote, from a massive drive to get photocopies of voter credentials to Election-Day food handouts and outright payments to voters. **********Under both state and federal elections laws, these practices are not illegal. ''Our problem is that vote-buying and coercion are gray areas in the legislation,'' said Emilio Zebadua, a member of the Federal Elections Council, which will oversee the presidential contest. **********But if the results are close in the race for President, the PRI's shenanigans could provoke an angry reaction from the opposition. ''We will certainly see these tactics next year, and they will stain the election,'' said Jose Antonio Crespo, an elections analyst. ''And they could become a source of serious conflict.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/world/us-ignores-mexico-s-anti-drug-failures.html,Tim With,1999-02-14,Clinton Administration officials praise Mexico's record on fighting illegal drugs this year even while admitting publicly that that record is bad by most statistical measures; yearly 'certification' process has become in the case of Mexico more of...,1231,,The New York Times,World,News,article,U.S. Ignores Mexico's Anti-Drug Failures,U.S. Ignores Mexico's Anti-Drug Failures," **********As the Clinton Administration weighs its annual evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting illegal drugs, United States officials admit privately that by most statistical measures, the Mexican record looks especially bad this year. **********Drug seizures by the Mexican police have fallen significantly. Nearly all of the most important Mexican narcotics traffickers identified last year remain at large. The promised extraditions of some Mexican drug suspects to the United States have not materialized, and drug enforcement programs have been rocked by a series of public conflicts between the two Governments. **********Yet even as President Clinton embarks on a brief visit to Mexico starting Sunday, his aides have neither despaired of such facts nor spent much time analyzing them. **********''There is a difference between cooperation and success,'' the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, argued this week. While their cooperation might not be having much effect on the problem, he suggested, Mexican officials ''are cooperating more closely with the United States at virtually every level than ever before.'' **********The fervor with which Administration officials are praising Mexico's record -- even before studying the assessments being collected from various Government agencies -- underscores how for Mexico the yearly ''certification'' process has become more of a joint public-relations campaign aimed at the Congress than an  objective appraisal. **********''This is not about what Mexico has done,'' one Administration official said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. ''This is about convincing the Hill that whatever Mexico has done is enough.'' **********Administration officials say their evaluation, which is expected by the end of the month and mandated by a 1986 law for countries where drugs are produced or transported, is particularly counterproductive in Mexico. **********To observe the law strictly and possibly impose the economic penalties it contemplates, they argue, would be to place a strategic and complex relationship at risk for just one of the many interests that the United States has in Mexico. And Mexican officials have done their best to underscore that risk. **********''I don't even want to think what de-certification would provoke,'' Mexico's Ambassador to the United States, Jesus Reyes Heroles, said in an interview. ''The equilibrium that underlies our relationship with the United States would be undone.'' **********Many analysts of Mexican politics describe such warnings as overblown. Moreover, aides to a half-dozen Washington legislators who have played leading roles on the drug issue say Mexico's de-certification is unlikely anyway. **********The aides, speaking on the condition they not be identified, said they expected a formal endorsement of Mexico's efforts from the Administration and then an energetic Congressional effort to override that endorsement. But they added that they see no clear sign that they will be any more able to reverse the certification than they were last year, when a Senate motion for disapproval gathered only 45 votes. **********''There's a kind of weariness with fighting the same battle over and over,'' a Senate aide said. ''It gets old.'' **********Supporters of the Administration note that although the Mexican authorities have not made much headway against the drug mafias over the last year, the establishment of elite anti-drug units within the army and the federal police has led to closer working relationships with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. **********But officials from each of those agencies challenge the Administration's public assertion that the Mexican authorities are trying their best. Those officials contend that the obstacle to success in Mexico is not so much the strength of the traffickers or the inexperience of the police but the Mexican Government's unwillingness to fight corruption more aggressively. **********Intelligence officers working with the military's special anti-drug force, the Center for Anti-Narcotics Information, say they believe that some of its efforts may have been compromised by corrupt superiors, officials said. Three senior agents of an elite Mexican police force trained by American officials failed lie-detector tests last year over questions about their contacts with drug traffickers. **********The agents were moved out of the unit but remain in the federal police. **********Drug investigations that have touched on several well-known Mexican politicians and at least a dozen high-ranking military officers have not yet led to any arrests, despite what American officials describe as strong evidence that some of the politicians and officers have sought to protect traffickers in return for large bribes. **********Perhaps most important, officials say that on a series of occasions over the last year, American intelligence and law-enforcement officials have provided their Mexican counterparts with information on the whereabouts of powerful drug traffickers, only to have Mexican agents mishandle the intelligence or wait for hours before carrying out raids. **********''We give them houses, we give them phone numbers -- and nothing happens,'' said an United States official. ''Cases go nowhere.'' **********An embarrassing example of the problem will provide a backdrop for President Clinton's meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo, which are to take place in and around the city of Merida, on the Yucatan peninsula. **********Just across the peninsula, in the state of Quintana Roo, United States intelligence and law-enforcement officials have been working for more than a year with elite Mexican forces to dismantle a major drug smuggling operation with headquarters in the resort city of Cancun. **********In one debacle last spring, American officials said, officers of the military intelligence unit recognized two of the most important traffickers in the Cancun organization, Ramon Alcides Magana and Albino Quintero Meraz, but made no attempt to capture them. **********On other occasions, American intelligence officials gave officers of the military unit home addresses and telephone numbers for each of the two traffickers. But again, officials said, opportunities to arrest the pair were lost. **********Last October, the unit appeared to get an important break when it captured Gilberto Garza Garcia, the trafficker who oversaw the mafia's movement of cocaine shipments from Cancun up the gulf coast to McAllen, Tex. **********But United States and Mexican officials said that after negotiating with the general who headed the military unit and promising to help him trap Mr. Magana, Mr. Garza Garcia was placed in the custody of two detectives from whom he escaped the next day. **********(The general has since been reassigned, Mr. Garza has been recaptured and the detectives have been under investigation since being found with more than $20,000 given to them by the trafficker.) **********The White House drug-policy chief, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, suggested that such short-term failings should not distract the United States from its ultimate goals for Mexico. And while he and other White House officials have often tried to silence law-enforcement agencies that are critical of Mexico's performance, he did not hesitate to offer his own view on certification in advance of the Administration's deliberations. **********''I think what we ought to do is look at U.S. national interests in the long term,'' General McCaffrey said. **********''Do we think that partnership with Mexico is important to us and is beginning to show signs of substantial cooperation? My own advice'' to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright ''is they should be certified.'' **********Mexican officials have undertaken a similarly aggressive defense of their efforts, lobbying more intensively in Washington and spending $100,000 a month to hire three high-profile lobbying firms to assist them in getting their message out. **********Mexican officials have also held out to United States officials the possibility that they might yet deliver a spectacular, last-minute blow in the drug fight, one that could erase questions on Capitol Hill about their willingness to move against the mafias. **********Skeptical American officials have taken to calling this notion ''the February surprise.''"

And, thus, it did not ultimately break with the debilitating tradition of bending the judicial system to shifting political purposes. **********President Ernesto Zedillo made a forceful move to consolidate his power and eliminate holdover influences of his predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, when he authorized Raul Salinas's arrest on homicide charges on Feb. 28, 1995, barely three months into his term. **********Since then Carlos Salinas and his family have become reviled symbols of corruption, and Mr. Zedillo has maintained his distance from them. **********Carlos Salinas went into exile in February 1995, shortly after his brother's arrest, and has most recently been living in Ireland. **********Mexicans assume, based on experience, that with Mr. Zedillo clearly on the side of convicting Raul Salinas, Judge Ojeda knew which way to go. **********''The case is based totally on hearsay,'' said a political analyst, Jorge Castaneda. ''This is not the rule of law. This is the political use of justice the way it has always been done.'' **********Judge Ojeda, 39, who has had a hand in several of Mexico's most explosive criminal cases, anticipated that he would be accused of tailoring his ruling to Mr. Zedillo's will. In a 16-page summary of the voluminous verdict, the judge wrote, ''We did not receive any orders, pressures or messages, nor was any other action taken intended to subordinate us to any interest other than that of justice.'' **********Indeed, Judge Ojeda presided over the four-year case with unusual dispassion. He kept journalists and politicians at arm's length and never gave the defense cause to complain about his handling of the case. **********Judge Ojeda, who had sole responsibility for the decision, because there is no jury trial in the Mexican system, acknowledged that there was no definitive proof of Raul Salinas's guilt. Rather, he said, the judge  was moved by what he called ''interlocking evidence'' to impose the 50-year sentence, the maximum for any crime under Mexican law. **********He was apparently persuaded mainly by the testimony of one witness, Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez. Mr. Rodriguez Gonzalez has been convicted of organizing and deploying the team that killed a politician, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, on  Sept. 28, 1994, on a street here. **********Mr. Rodriguez Gonzalez testified in February 1995 that Mr. Salinas was behind the crime after he had been in custody for nearly five months. **********Judge Ojeda pointed to statements by at least six other witnesses, as well as to records of telephone calls to Mr. Salinas's house in the days after the shooting, that supported Mr. Rodriguez Gonzalez's account that Mr. Salinas had asked a political associate to set up the assassination. **********Judge Ojeda was not deterred by the fact that the associate, an undistinguished but ambitious Federal Congressman, Manuel Munoz Rocha, who is recognized by all sides as the crucial witness in the case, disappeared one day after the shooting. He is being sought on charges of first-degree murder. **********Immediately after Mr. Rodriguez Gonzalez accused Mr. Salinas a new prosecutor appointed by President Zedillo paid the witness $500,000. In a part of his ruling that the defense is sure to challenge on appeal Judge Ojeda found that the payment did ''not constitute a bribe,'' because Mr. Rodriguez Gonzalez never received the money. A member of his family apparently took the money. **********Nor was Judge Ojeda troubled by the prosecution's failure to demonstrate any powerful motive for Mr. Salinas to order the murder of Mr. Ruiz Massieu, who had been married to Raul Salinas's sister, Adriana, remained a political confidante of Carlos Salinas until the killing. **********The judge accepted the prosecution's argument that Raul Salinas nursed a grudge against Mr. Ruiz Massieu over his divorce from Mr. Salinas's sister and from a feud between the two men over a Government construction project. **********The court record showed little evidence to illustrate those tensions. **********The defense lawyers said they would appeal to the next level of Federal courts and ask the Supreme Court to dismiss the case because of prosecutors' irregularities. **********Legal experts said appeals courts rarely overturned criminal verdicts. **********One powerful expression of doubt about the verdict came from the victim's family. In an open letter published today the Ruiz Massieu family said, ''All the irregularities and illegal acts in this case make us doubt the good faith of the prosecutors responsible for sustaining the accusations.'' **********Mr. Ruiz Massieu's relatives said they were ''very sad'' that the truth of his murder would never be known. **********In the streets of Mexico City, however, opinion ran strongly in favor of the verdict, although Mexicans said they were convinced that it was politically induced. **********''Fifty years, that's good,'' said Salome Pena, 31, an employee in a drugstore near the Justice Palace, home of the appeals courts. ''It should have been more. But I'm sure they'll appeal. And then under the next President he will get out.'' **********A bus driver, Raul Sanchez, 36,  said: ''We finally got some justice. I don't care if it's political revenge. They should impose the death sentence on him and all those who abused political power.'' **********It seems unlikely that Carlos Salinas will be able to repair his reputation or return to live here soon. Carlos Rojas Gutierrez, secretary general of the Salinas brothers' party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, expressed his ''full respect'' for the verdict. The PRI is also Mr. Zedillo's party. **********Whatever the flaws of the verdict, many Mexicans welcomed the precedent that it set. ''It may seem inconsistent to overturn impunity with something far less than perfect justice,'' Federico Estevez, a political scientist, said. ''But it still made a very important point.''"

J. Tylee Wilson, the former R. J. Reynolds chief executive who merged the tobacco company with Nabisco in 1985, still thinks that building a broad-based consumer products company makes sense. But Mr. Wilson, now 68 and retired, is not about to second-guess the intention of RJR Nabisco Holdings, t announced last week, to split up the businesses and sell foreign tobacco operations. **********''I haven't the faintest idea how it would work out for shareholders, but they had to do something and this looks like a reasonable solution,'' he said, citing the company's debts. **********He found some satisfaction from Japan Tobacco's willingness to pay $8 billion for the international tobacco operations, saying, ''I set that business up in 1976.'' **********RJR itself has come full circle, back to the way it was in the 1960's, Mr. Wilson said. But if  tobacco companies have always been besieged by competitors and regulators, today's climate is the worst ever, he said, concluding, ''I certainly would never go into the business today.'' **********Peter Atkins, a lawyer who advised the RJR Nabisco board on buyout offers, said that RJR might have split up sooner if Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had not bought it. In the 1990's, other companies have sold off operations to focus on core businesses. ''The demerger of RJR Nabisco is a late arrival in a fairly well-established trend,'' he said. ''It might well have occurred earlier but for the constraint of dealing with its liabilities, including tobacco litigation and debt.''   BARNABY J. FEDER"

Like so many entrepreneurs in the 1990's, Ms. Zraly -- a consultant, lecturer and author -- headed for the World Wide Web. **********Her Web site, Champagnelady.com, is a decidedly modest foray into Internet commerce. It amounts to an advertisement for herself and an on-line shop for merchandise, including a book she has written and all manner of champagne paraphernalia, glasses, ice buckets, even earrings. No corporate powerhouses quake at the mention of her Web site. No Wall Street bankers are wooing Champagnelady.com, eager to sell its shares in a public stock offering. **********Yet Ms. Zraly's venture shows one side of the new economics of the Internet. ''Anybody can afford to get into business this way,'' she said. ''It's cheaper than my cable TV bill.'' **********Behind Ms. Zraly, pocketing a $60 monthly fee for running her Web site, is an unlikely partner -- the International Business Machines Corporation, the world's largest computer company. Its customers have long been its corporate peers on the Fortune 500, not tiny upstarts. Until a few years ago, that is, when the Internet took off and I.B.M. went with it in new and innovative directions. **********I.B.M. itself shows another side of the new economics of the Internet -- how a big, old-line company can turn the challenge of technological upheaval into a rejuvenating opportunity. I.B.M. has embraced the Internet in its products, practices and marketing -- from overhauling its mainframes into Internet computers to refashioning itself as an Internet leader with its giant ''e-business'' advertising campaign. **********The result has been a startling revival in I.B.M.'s prospects and image. A few years ago, I.B.M. was stumbling as the mantle of leadership in computing seemed to have passed to the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, the technology standard-setters of the personal computer era. But the Internet changed the landscape again. **********The rise of the Internet -- a vast global network -- played to I.B.M.'s traditional strengths. It required powerful centralized computers to serve up data to millions of viewers. And I.B.M. adapted its big-iron computers to Internet protocols, recasting them as giant Web servers and the transaction-processing workhorses of electronic commerce. **********As the Internet moves beyond the experimental stage, as more and more companies actually run their businesses on the Internet, those systems must be robust, secure and up and running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That level of reliability is second nature to I.B.M., and it is why airline reservations systems, national defense systems and the like depend on I.B.M. **********''We were moving in the right direction and, frankly, we were lucky as well,'' said Nicholas Donofrio, the senior vice president for technology at I.B.M. ''The industry moved our way.'' **********Today, I.B.M. is a leading supplier of technology and know-how in the Internet era. The well-known names of this new world may be America Online, Amazon.com and Yahoo, but I.B.M. has emerged as the quiet giant of the Internet by serving as a kind of arms supplier for this new economy to companies of all sizes. In that role, it has plenty of competition from a wide range of companies, including Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and others. But none has risen as fast from what seemed to be so far behind not long ago. **********''I.B.M. is getting a real bounce from the Internet,'' said Stan Dolberg, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''It seemed a moribund company three or four years ago. But I.B.M. jumped on the Internet instantly, and it's been an innovator. It has surprised a lot of people.'' **********THE company estimates that roughly one-quarter of its revenue -- or $20 billion -- is driven all or in part by E-business demand. It defines E-business as companies grappling with Internet-related projects, from setting up a Web site to reach customers to handling most of its procurement over the Internet. **********I.B.M. has helped thousands of small companies get on the Web, and it runs their sites for fees that range up to $200 a month. By 2001, it hopes to have two million small-business customers. **********Yet it is the larger companies that remain I.B.M.'s bread-and-butter business. They often hire I.B.M. to help them use the power of Internet technology to revamp the way they deal with suppliers, customers and employees in an effort to lower their costs, focus their marketing and eliminate mountains of paperwork. These can be multimillion-dollar projects. **********Most of this work involves the economic infrastructure of companies dealing with one another -- known as business-to-business commerce. It is the business-to-consumer commerce of Amazon.com, Ebay and others that understandably gets the most attention. But streamlining business-to-business transactions will ultimately have the greatest effect on consumers in terms of prices and quality of service. **********Business-to-business dealings, analysts say, represent the biggest opportunity for Internet commerce over the next several years. Forrester Research estimates that consumer sales over the Internet will jump to $108 billion by 2003 from $3.9 billion last year. But that impressive increase is dwarfed by Forrester's projection for business-to-business commerce on the Internet, rising to $1.3 trillion by 2003 from $45 billion last year. **********And it is industry's ''back office'' -- procurement, accounting, order-processing and the like -- that economists are watching most closely for evidence that the spread of the Internet is leading a technology-based productivity payoff in the nation's economy. The evidence on that front is still inconclusive, but that could be because the use of powerful computing and Internet technology has not gone very far yet. **********Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., made that very point in a speech before industry analysts and professional investors in May. He bemusedly observed all the attention lavished on ''these new dot-com Internet companies'' by the media and Wall Street, before proceeding to his theme. **********''But I think of them as fireflies before the storm: all stirred up, throwing off sparks,'' Mr. Gerstner said. ''But the storm that's arriving -- the real disturbance in the Force -- is when the thousands of institutions that exist today seize the power of this global computing and communications infrastructure and use it to transform themselves. That's the real revolution.'' **********Under Mr. Gerstner, I.B.M. has undergone its own internal transformation. Much of its sales, service, procurement and training are now handled on the Web. **********I.B.M. estimates that $3.3 billion of its sales last year were over the Web, or roughly five times those of Amazon.com. This year, I.B.M. plans to have Web sales -- mainly to corporate customers -- of $10 billion to $15 billion. The company figures it will save $600 million this year by letting customers find answers to straightforward service and technical support questions on specialized I.B.M. Web pages, thus freeing the time of its human support staff for more complex problems. By handling a portion of its internal training over the Internet instead of in classrooms, I.B.M. estimates it will save $100 million. And by procuring $12 billion worth of goods over the Web this year, I.B.M. says it will do away with about 5 million pages of paper forms. **********TO position itself as a company on the cutting edge of electronic commerce, I.B.M. began a major advertising campaign in the fall of 1997, promoting the notion of ''e-business.'' The term was new then but has since become routinely used in newspaper and magazine stories and in the marketing campaigns of other companies. The I.B.M. ad campaign -- budgeted at $550 million worldwide this year -- has featured customers of all kinds, from body-pierced Web designers to Ms. Zraly to corporate titans. Its implicit message is that the Internet is not about just putting up a Web site, it is the technological starting point for a complex rethinking of how business is done. Trust us, we're I.B.M., we know more about business and complex technology than anyone else. **********Big companies like Ford, United Parcel Service, Charles Schwab and Bank One have chosen I.B.M. as their technology partner as they try to exploit the Internet to transform their businesses. Yet so have ambitious start-ups that are trying to change the economics of an industry, like E-Chemicals Inc. **********E-Chemicals, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., is an on-line marketplace for chemicals, founded by a group of former Dow Chemical employees and distribution experts. Its chairman is Yossi Sheffi, the director of the Center for Transportation Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and its president and chief executive is Jim Alampi, the former head of one of the nation's largest chemical distributors. **********The chemical business is a $250-billion-a-year industry in the United States. E-Chemicals is betting it can make its fortune by streamlining the industry's fragmented distribution system, a jury-built setup based on industry directories, phone calls, faxes and relationships with distributors. **********Its on-line chemical marketplace lists 20 suppliers, including Dow Chemical and DuPont, more than 1,000 products and 600 registered customers. For suppliers, E-Chemicals offers a low-cost way to sell to small customers, right down to sales of a couple of 55-gallon drums. For smaller buyers, E-Chemicals promises to substantially level the playing field by offering the kind of lower prices usually available only to distributors' big customers. **********E-Chemicals can do that because of its lower expenses, operating as a kind of ''virtual corporation'' that uses subcontractors for much of its basic work. It has just 20 employees. Sun Trust Banks acts as its credit and collections department, and Yellow Freight serves as its logistics department. I.B.M. helped build its large Web site at www.e-chemicals.com and supplies much of its critical software. The site is hosted at a huge I.B.M. data center in Schaumburg, Ill. **********E-Chemicals says it chose I.B.M. because of its history of serving chemical-industry customers and its tradition of building and running computing systems that handle  thousands upon thousands of complex industrial transactions. **********''For what we are doing, we're not talking about some on-line billboard where how it looks and the user interface are all that matter,'' Mr. Alampi said. **********''We're doing real commerce on this Web site,'' he said. ''It has to be secure, and it has to be able to quickly increase the volume of transactions it can handle. I.B.M. can do that. And we don't want to have to buy computer hardware ourselves, so we let them handle all that by hosting the site. At E-Chemicals, our expertise is in the chemical business and distribution, and we want to stay focused on that.'' **********Saab Cars U.S.A., the American distribution arm of the Swedish auto maker, is putting in place a Web-based system that is a typical example of how existing companies are trying to use Internet technology to improve customer service. Most of its 210 dealers now have a new system, using mostly I.B.M. computers and software, for ordering parts and providing customer service and training. The dealers tap in from personal computers to Saab's database, and the early goal is to make dealer service more timely and efficient. **********YET the company is also working on creating more detailed, car-by-car data profiles that customers can use. With help from I.B.M., the company is building a vast ''customer vehicle database'' that will, for example, allow the owner of a used Saab to look up the repair history of that car. A person interested in buying a new Saab will be able to go to the company's Web site, look at the available models and arrange on line for the local dealer to deliver one for a test drive. **********''The goal is to serve customers better and ultimately sell more cars,'' explained Jerry Rode, the director of information technology for Saab. **********The Bank One Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest banking company, faces the classic Internet challenge of an enterprise with a vast brick-and-mortar network. It has more than 1,900 offices nationwide, serving more than 9 million retail customers. **********Bank One is making a big Internet push, both with its own Web site and by opening a virtual bank last June, Wingspan.com. John B. McCoy, the president of Bank One, succinctly summed up the thinking behind these moves: ''I am not about to sit here and let someone take my business.'' **********I.B.M. is helping Bank One with its Internet strategy for gathering more customers. Wingspan.com is run from I.B.M.'s Schaumburg data center, selected for its reliability and knowledge of networks. **********But Bill Wallace, the top technology executive for Wingspan.com, also mentions one attribute that is surprising for a company once viewed as a dinosaur. **********''The Web is about speed,'' he explained, ''and I.B.M. can move very quickly these days.'' **********She Knows Her Bubbly, But Nothing About Bytes **********ROSEMARY ZRALY has a recommendation for personal computer makers. ''They should give out Valium with the PC when you buy one,'' she said. ''It's painful learning how to really use one.'' **********Ms. Zraly wanted to avoid having to master Web technology to get her on-line business, Champagnelady.com, up and running. That was why I.B.M.'s Home Page Creator service for small businesses appealed to her: it seemed to be a practically pain free way to start an Internet venture. **********I.B.M. helped her set up a Web site, which is run at I.B.M.'s data center in Schaumburg, Ill., outside Chicago. Ms. Zraly does not baby-sit for computer hardware or fret about software bugs or crashes. I.B.M. also handles most of the back-office plumbing of Internet business, processing the on-line transactions and credit-card verification. **********''All I have to do is ship the goods when I receive an order,'' Ms. Zraly said. **********The monthly fees for the I.B.M. small-business service range from $30 to $200, depending on the Web site's size. Ms. Zraly pays I.B.M. $60 a month. **********She can check the traffic on her site, update it or edit it from her home office in New York.  And Ms. Zraly has adapted to the Web's always-on pace. **********''My Web site is the first thing I check every morning and the last thing I see at night,'' she said.''It's like living with another person, totally part of my life.''

To be precise, Texaco/ Havoline Presents the Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200, a FedEx Championship Series Event. **********Similarly, in Phoenix, the Microage Fiesta Bowl Parade precedes the annual Tostito Fiesta Bowl Football Classic. **********No, corporate sponsorship of special events is not a new phenomenon. But often, these days, you can barely find the event for the sponsors. **********Unadorned titles -- like the Indianapolis 500 and the Rose Parade -- have truly become an endangered species, as one event after another goes the way of the Kodak Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, Sunoco Welcome America! in Philadelphia and the Hooters Hula Bowl in Hawaii. Even that New Year's Day football game in Pasadena, Calif., has become the AT&T Rose Bowl. **********And to top it off, the single-sponsor event is rapidly giving way to the likes of the U S West Rose Festival Air Show Presented by Intel. **********''Fifteen years ago, fewer than 25 percent of festivals and events had some corporate involvement; today it's up to 85 percent,'' said Lesa Ukman, president of Chicago-based IEG Inc., which tracks sponsorship of events, sports, arts and entertainment. **********''In the early days, festivals and events organizers would go hat in hand asking for support,'' she said. ''Now they can show companies they're offering them a cost-effective way to increase sales and marketing objectives.'' **********Anything, it seems, is fair game. ''Almost every category of event you can think of now has sponsors,'' said Dennis Boese, corporate manager of fair and festival marketing for the Miller Brewing Company. **********Miller, a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, sponsors almost 90 events, from the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville to the Sant 'Yago Night Parade in Tampa, Fla., to the Official Shrimporee of Texas in Aransas Pass, Tex. **********Miller's target audience, Mr. Boese said, is men ages 21 to 35, so it backs many sports events -- but not the Portland Rose Festival, where Budweiser sponsors the auto race,  and a local company, Rogue Ales, is the official microbrewery. **********Sponsorship money is necessary, festival organizers say, to offset the increasing cost of entertainment, to hold ticket prices down and to finance the expansion into events needed to appeal to a wide audience. The 91-year-old Rose Festival, for example, has grown from a 2-day carnival in 1907 to a 25-day gala with 74 events and more than two million spectators. **********But not everyone is pleased with what some specialists in tourism, including Dennis R. Judd, describe as ''the McDonaldization of local events,'' of ''making them look more and more like a Disney production.'' **********Mr. Judd -- a professor of political science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and co-author of ''The Tourist City'' (Yale University Press) -- said that as festivals increasingly rely on corporate sponsorship, they lose their local identity. ''Before long, they resemble events everywhere else,'' he said. **********Corporate sponsorship accounts for 35 percent of the Rose Festival's $8 million budget; the remainder comes from concession sales and admission to events. **********According to Dean Runyan Associates, a travel-industry research firm, the festival's overall economic impact in the Portland area reached $79 million in 1996 -- the last year for which figures are available -- up from $44 million in 1988. **********This year, corporations will spend an estimated $685 million on festivals, fairs and annual events, according to IEG. That may be only 9 percent of the estimated $7.6 billion that will be spent on sponsorships in 1999 -- two-thirds of the total will go to auto racing, golf and other sports ing events. Still, it is triple the amount spent on fairs and festivals a decade ago, and $107 million more than last year. **********Moreover, the events that corporations are willing to sponsor have become more varied. Thus, the Rose Festival has attracted more than 200 sponsors: 150 paid at least $5,000 each and 7 provided contributions worth six figures. **********Leading Rose Festival sponsors included Southwest Airlines; the General Motors Pontiac division; the Pepsi-cola unit of Pepsico; Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group's Thrifty Rent-A-Car division, and Deloitte & Touche. The U S West Rose Festival Presented by Intel had 20 other sponsors, including Coors Light, Pepsi, Candlewood Hotel's Candlewood Suites unit and G.M. **********In addition, the festival boasted an official iced tea (Unilever's Lipton brand), sportswear company (Columbia Sportswear), coffee (Millstone), wine (Willamette Valley Vineyards) and messenger service (Pronto). The latter three are local or regional companies, as is the plumbing supply company that sponsored a Festival of Bands competition, the pancake and steak house that sponsored a jazz band competition and the dairy that sponsored milk-carton boat races for children. **********In the sponsorship pecking order, the most valuable, and expensive, position is title sponsor. That is the corporation whose name comes before the name of the event -- like Portland General Electric for the Starlight Parade, U S West for the air show, and Southwest Airlines for the floral parade. **********When an event is ''presented by,'' the presenting sponsor's name follows the event -- at a smaller cost than being title sponsor. The Rose Festival does not disclose how much its sponsors pay, but sponsorship of a breakfast for several hundred could cost more than $25,000 at a major festival, elaborate parade floats easily cost $40,000, while title sponsorship of an air show ranges from $200,000 to as much as $350,000. **********Southwest Airlines' sponsorship strategy is somewhat unusual, in view of its relatively limited route system. For one thing, its 30 or more sponsorships include designation as the official airline of both the Super Bowl and National Football League, even though it does not fly to every N.F.L. city. **********Similarly, months before it began service here in 1994, Southwest sent a team of almost a dozen people to see what events it could sponsor that were important to the community. It quickly settled on the Rose Festival. When Delta Air Lines dropped its six-year sponsorship of the Grand Floral Parade after the 1994 festival, Southwest moved in. **********''Our strategy is to be a major sponsor of events that connect with customers,'' said Linda Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman. ''So before we agree to sponsor anything, we spend a lot of time in a community talking with movers and shakers and travelers.'' **********Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, participates in everything from the California Strawberry Festival in Oxnard to Gold Rush Days in Wickenburg, Ariz., to the San Francisco Ballet and the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth. In Portland, it is the sole sponsor of the Italian Festival and summer concerts at the zoo two nights a week. **********''We want to sponsor things that will draw the largest number of families,'' said George J. Passadore,  president of the 121 Wells Fargo banks in Oregon. **********After it had participated in the Rose Festival for 51 years, First Interstate Bank was bought by Wells Fargo & Company in 1996 and dropped its sponsorships. **********But after Wells Fargo was taken over by the Norwest Corporation in November, decisions were decentralized; Mr. Passadore, who spent 37 years with First Interstate, wasted little time reconnecting with the Rose Festival -- now under the Wells Fargo banner. **********This year's Wells Fargo float won the Governor's Trophy for best craftsmanship and workmanship, and 275 Wells employees were prominent among the festival's 5,000 volunteers. While volunteers have long been mainstays of local events, Professor Judd said, they are being squeezed out of local and regional events by professional consultants whose mandate is to make them bigger, if not necessarily better. **********By most accounts, few companies realized the potential of corporate sponsorship, other than for sports events, until the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. **********''That was the key,'' said Bruce Skinner, president of the International Festivals and Events Association. ''Before that, corporate involvement was typically in the form of donations.'' **********Among the first to realize that broader potential, Ms. Ukman said, was George Wein, the one-time Boston nightclub owner who founded the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954. In 1972 he created the Schlitz Salute to Jazz, eventually bringing Kool cigarettes, American Express, Toyota and JVC into the corporate fold. **********Now, with the opportunity to get their name in the title, on floats, on signs, billboards and ticket stubs, corporations increasingly participate in events big and small. **********But no one knows better than festival officials that corporate sponsors can be fickle. ''Sometimes they pull out because of a change in their marketing strategy, or a downturn in their industry or in the economy,'' Mr. Clark of the Rose Festival said. ''Then there are mergers, or a company moves away.'' **********Last month, the Eastman Kodak Company said it would soon end its 62-year sponsorship of the Kodak Hula Show in Honolulu. The free event, started by Kodak in 1937 and shown twice a week, costs the company more than $500,000 a year. A Kodak spokesman said that the show draws older visitors while the company hopes to attract younger people interested in photography. **********Southwest Airlines has also changed its mind on occasion. After sponsoring the Texas State Fair parade for many years, it pulled out in 1996. ''We had enough recognition among Texans,'' Ms. Rutherford said, ''so we decided to put that sponsorship money into other things.''"

Since its defeat in World War II, a Constitution written by the United States prohibited most military activities. **********But in recent years Japan's refusal to participate in international peacekeeping efforts has drawn criticism from the United States and other allies, especially in regional crises like the recent turmoil in East Timor. **********The other expected initiatives include badly needed changes in the financing of nursing care for the elderly and social welfare. **********New Komeito is the political arm of one of the largest and most controversial religious groups, the lay Buddhist organization known as Soka Gakkai. **********The expansion of the coalition to include the group occurred only after weeks of negotiations that threatened to rupture the Liberal Democratic Party's existing coalition. **********Although Soka Gakkai maintains that it is independent, many Japanese suspect that it is dominated by Soka Gakkagi, its Buddhist parent organization and its shadowy honorary chairman, Daisuki Ikeda. **********Mr. Obuchi has been riding a wave of unexpectedly good news like an apparent upturn in the long-depressed economy and the steady but not unrelated strength in his approval ratings. **********This morning, most newspaper readers rose to find him smiling triumphantly in photographs with his new coalition partners. **********Although, the Cabinet reshuffle brought about a near wholesale turnover of the Government, Mr. Obuchi retained his top economic advisers, including the Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. **********But Mr. Obuchi replaced the chief of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, Hakuo Yanagisawa, who was widely respected among Western banking analysts for his handling of problems in the financial system. He was succeeded by Michio Ochi, a former Economic Planning Minister. [Page C4.] **********Among the new appointments are Yohei Kono as Foreign Minister. Mr. Kono is a former Deputy Prime Minister who was also Foreign Minister in a previous Government. **********Notwithstanding Mr. Obuchi's newly strengthened parliamentary position, many political analysts here say there are still threatening clouds on the horizon. **********The most immediate involves perceptions that the Government mishandled the accident last week at a nuclear-fuel reprocessing plant. **********Japanese press reports focused abundantly on the bureaucratic bungling of the emergency response that kept Mr. Obuchi from learning of the accident on Thursday until two hours after it had occurred. For much of that time, Mr. Obuchi was out to lunch. **********Most accounts made it appear that the Prime Minister and his top aides continued to be more preoccupied with negotiations over the new Cabinet than with the nuclear disaster. **********''This was a disaster that may have major consequences on their future nuclear policy, but one wonders just how seriously this is being taken,'' said John Neuffer, a political analyst with Mitsui Marine Research Institute. **********Mr. Obuchi's longer-range threat in terms of public opinion arrives, though, from the strong opposition in many quarters to the entry of what many Japanese consider a religious party into politics. Although his own poll numbers are at their highest level ever, recent surveys indicate that up to 51 percent of voters oppose the Buddhist-related party's entry into the coalition. **********The expansion of the coalition to include Komeito nearly backfired on Mr. Obuchi, who faced strong opposition within his own party and from his other coalition partner, the smaller more conservative Liberal Party. **********''If Komeito were outside of the Government, the price of gaining their cooperation would be higher, and that is why Obuchi has invited them in,'' said Seizaburo Sato, deputy director of the National Graduate Institute of Policy Studies. ''But Komeito is regarded suspiciously, because it is not organized like other parties. It is dominated by one individual.''"

''To demonstrate that the A.N.C. is serious about moral renewal, it needs to punish immorality and criminal actions by members of its own ranks,'' said the Christian Democrats' president, Kenneth Meshoe. **********In a country with a jobless rate that may be as high as 40 percent and a crime rate so high that there are an average of 140 murders or attempted murders every day, unemployment and safety are the issues that top the agenda for most South Africans. But with only four weeks to go before this country's second post-apartheid elections, corruption is emerging as a key issue too. **********Polls indicate that South Africans give the Mr. Mandela's Government a poor rating on rooting out and controlling corruption in its ranks. Only 37 percent of the people taking part in a poll conducted last November by the Institute for Democracy in South Africa said the Government has done a good job in this area. **********Lately the A.N.C. has begun to take on this issue. It held a conference on corruption last month. The booklet, which encapsulates the topics discussed at the conference, pledges, among other measures, to engage its members in a meaningful debate on the subject. **********In addition, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who is expected to become the country's next President, is holding daylong public hearings in the country's three most populous provinces to ''obtain first hand impressions'' about the problem. **********At the first session in Soweto last week, many of those who took to the microphones could hardly control their anger and frustration. Hospital employees said some doctors and nurses sold medical files to lawyers involved in insurance scams; crime victims told of watching perpetrators go free because ''suddenly'' the evidence had disappeared, and township residents told of paying money to housing officials for houses that never materialized. **********Most wore A.N.C. buttons and T-shirts or waved party flags and talked of low-level corruption. But one elderly man withstood the boos of the crowd to aim higher. ''Don't come to us only when it is election time because you will not know all our concerns,'' he said, adding that the A.N.C. needs to root out corruption in its own ranks before coming to the people. Mr. Mbeki simply stared at him. **********Many experts say the way South Africa's first black Government has handled allegations of corruption has left it vulnerable to criticism. Certainly corruption is nothing new to South Africa. Experts say there may well have been more of it under the former apartheid Government, although information about it was far more tightly controlled then. **********The Government's leading corruption investigator, Justice Willem Heath, says he has recovered millions of dollars in recent years, much of it from corrupt officials who were operating long before Mr. Mandela was elected in 1994. **********But some experts point out that the A.N.C. tends to circle the wagons when allegations of corruption are made against its own members, particularly those who were active during the anti-apartheid struggle. **********''The A.N.C. has not always acted swiftly and cleanly in dealing with corruption,'' said Tom Lodge, a political analyst with the University of Witwatersrand. ''They are always saying: 'We'll have to wait and see. There has been no conviction yet.' Whereas in many countries, just an allegation of corruption and you are out.'' **********Even in recent months, with the elections coming up, the A.N.C. appears to have made several missteps in this area. **********For instance, when it unveiled its preliminary list of candidates in March, opposition parties had a field day. Democratic Party officials quickly found 17 who they said had questionable records. The New National Party, another opposition group, found 12. **********The allegations ranged from the petty to the serious and included one candidate who had been convicted of attempted murder. Several others were under investigation for fraud. Eventually, seven candidates were dropped from the list. **********Mr. Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who has been convicted of kidnapping and could face further charges relating to the activities of her bodyguards in the late 1980's, remains high on the final list of candidates. She is still extremely popular among the poorest South Africans and has been a potent campaigner for the party. **********Only a few weeks ago, the A.N.C. was embroiled in another controversy that critics saw as more evidence of loose standards when it came to those with ''struggle credentials.'' It nominated a lawyer, Ramesh Vassen, to be South Africa's consul general to India. **********While Mr. Vassen was once a member of the present Justice Minister's law firm and an anti-apartheid activist, he also turns out to have been convicted of stealing money from client trust funds. At first, A.N.C. officials defended their choice, though eventually Mr. Vassen's nomination was withdrawn. **********Critics of the A.N.C. see a far broader pattern of ethical laxness. They point to incidents ranging from the hero's welcome that was afforded to another anti-apartheid activist, Allan Boesak, when he returned to face charges of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from his own foundation (he was convicted) to the refusal to take any action at all against the Health Minister, Nkosazana Zuma. Her department had been accused of wasting millions of dollars on an extravagant and ineffective AIDS prevention play, called Sarafina 2. Investigators have concluded that the awarding of the contract for the play was highly irregular. **********There is little doubt that the A.N.C. will win the June 2 national and provincial elections anyhow. It is still riding a wave of loyalty for its role in bringing apartheid to an end. But the party wants a two-thirds majority, which would give it the power to change the constitution if it wants to. So every vote counts. And party officials, obviously, believe that the corruption issue is hurting them. **********On the campaign trail, Mr. Mbeki often deplores corruption and calls on everyone to take action against it. When Mr. Mbeki finally rose to speak at the Chiawelo Community Center in Soweto recently he urged the audience to fight back. **********In the measured tones that have become his trademark as a speaker, he suggested that while there was no bed linen left at the local hospital, many of them could see hospital linen hanging from their neighbors' washing lines. They must take steps to report their neighbors, he said. **********''Government cannot succeed if you just sit here,'' he said. **********Mr. Mbeki has been outspoken about the need for moral rejuvenation. He argues that the years under apartheid have left the country in ''a threatening state of moral degradation.'' **********But some analysts say that the A.N.C.'s recent efforts to confront corruption -- the conference, the  booklet and Mr. Mbeki's tours -- are simply a way of focusing attention away from the Government's handling of the problem. **********''What they are doing right now is a political strategy to cope with the fallout,'' Mr. Lodge said. ''These are not an anti-corruption measure.''"

The Itanium is the first chip in the family that is known as the IA64, which is planned to be the successor to Intel's x86 family. **********Because of the overwhelming dominance of the personal computer market by the x86 family, many computer analysts have predicted that the IA64 will also dominate the computer industry. **********Both Intel's and I.B.M.'s advanced designs are intended to meet the demands for a new class of commercial computer brought on by the rapid growth of the Internet. E-commerce has created a seemingly insatiable demand for computers that can process millions of transactions a second and achieve reliability once demanded only by banking and other specialized applications. **********I.B.M. and Intel have taken divergent paths. **********I.B.M. engineers argue that the critical design issue is what they call ''balance,'' the ability to move vast amounts of data quickly inside a processor to avoid delays or bottlenecks. Thus, I.B.M. has concentrated on efficiently packaging data and on increasing the rate at which data move within the processor by improving routes and shortening distances between transistors. It has also added memory to the processor. **********Intel, in contrast, has adopted a far more complex approach involving a fundamental new processor design, or architecture, to move more data simultaneously, or in parallel. **********Industry analysts said they were impressed with the I.B.M. approach. **********''This is a phenomenal piece of engineering,'' said Keith Deifendorff, a computer designer and an editor at Microprocessor Design, an industry newsletter. ''The engineering behind it and the completeness of the design is really impressive.'' **********I.B.M. executives said the Power4 was a road map of its future high-end processor design. The first commercial systems based on the new chip will reach the market in 2001. **********To build the Power4 the company plans to rely on its most advanced chipmaking technology, making it possible to squeeze as many as 170 million transistors onto the chip. **********The processor -- actually two processors in one -- will execute as many as five instructions with each tick of the chip's internal clock. It also can execute commands in the most efficient order for the task at hand instead of in a strict sequence. **********Fully 60 percent of the transistors in the new design will be devoted to cache memory, which greatly speeds processing by keeping often-used commands close at hand for instant execution. The designers said that it will be possible to move data between the processor and memory inside the chip at 100 billion bytes per second -- roughly the equivalent of  moving 20 full-length movies a second through the processor. **********Achieving these speeds required great attention to the routing of wires inside the chip. **********''We're now seeing a lot of science being applied to how we route wires,'' said Vijay T. Lund, vice president for server technology development at I.B.M."

Then, one by one, the big names landed: Hakkinen, Schumacher, Coulthard, Irvine, Frentzen. **********The cast and props are now all in place in Kuala Lumpur for the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday. And while the expected 350 million television viewers might see the event as just 56 laps around a ring of black road, the race is a milestone for Malaysia, for Formula One and for the Asian sports industry. **********Malaysia will become the first country in Asia outside Japan to join the prestigious Formula One circuit. For Malaysia, a successful race will be proof that a developing country can stage a major international motor-racing event as competently โ or better โ than the big boys in Europe. **********For Formula One, the race Sunday is a test case that may decide the direction of the sport. Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One's chief executive, has indicated that the Malaysian Grand Prix may be just the beginning of other races in Asia, where countries are willing to bend over backward to attract the millions of dollars that the sport can pump into an economy. **********The region's trump card over Europe is clear, as Asia is relatively free of the obstacles that frustrate Formula One organizers in traditional markets: threats to ban tobacco advertising, limits on noise and red tape. **********Formula One organizers have had nothing but praise for the new dollars 100 million track and facilities that Malaysia built. **********""The crews say they have never worked in conditions like this,"" a Formula One official said this week amid hurried preparations for the race. ""They've never had this much room. Their first impressions are very positive."" **********It is perhaps ironic that Formula One's foray into Southeast Asia is taking place in a country with no strong motor-racing culture. But that is not really the point. **********Formula One is in Malaysia mostly because the government made all the right moves to lure race organizers, building first a major airport and then the state-of-the-art track a few kilometers away. **********The result is that Malaysia will be the first new country to hold a race since Hungary in 1986. **********The Malaysian Grand Prix is the brainchild of Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, who is clearly pleased to have lured Formula One. **********""Motor sports will help to put us on the world map and attract commerce and tourists to Malaysia,"" Mr. Mahathir said Thursday at a motor sports exhibition in Kuala Lumpur. **********Indeed, a recent study commissioned by the International Automobile Federation, the sport's governing body, indicated that nearly dollars 500 million is spent each year by spectators visiting the 10 or 11 races in Europe. **********The Malaysian government made its first move into car racing in 1995, when the national oil company, Petroliam Nasional, or Petronas, took up sponsorship of the Sauber Formula One team. **********A year later, Malaysia became the first government to sponsor a Formula One team in a 41-million ringgit (dollars 10.7-million), two-year deal with Jackie Stewart's new team. The sponsorship, which was canceled after a year because of the regional economic crisis, included a ""Visit Malaysia"" logo on the team car. **********But before the crisis set in, Malaysia had struck a deal with Formula One to hold a race in Asia and then came out on top against several other Asian rival countries. **********China was to have been the site of the race and was on the 1999 schedule until it was removed because of logistical problems experienced by the organizers. **********Other countries that bid for the race at the same time as Malaysia were Singapore and Indonesia. India, too, has recently shown interest, as has South Korea. **********Mr. Mahathir appointed Basir Ismail, the chairman of Malaysia Airports, to carry out the negotiations. **********At Mr. Ecclestone's suggestion, Mr. Basir signed up Tilke GmbH, a German company, to design and build the track. **********The 5.5-kilometer (3.4-mile) circuit, which features 15 turns and 8 straightaways, is the world's widest, at an average of 16 meters (52 feet) across. **********That design, race organizers say, promises an exciting race with constant passing. **********Some 70 percent of the track is visible to spectators in what is the sport's longest grandstand, a double-frontage structure seating 30,000. **********The grandstand's large roof canopies were designed to block out the tropical sun. **********Malaysia's climate may pose an added challenge for drivers on Sunday. Mika Hakkinen of the McLaren team, who visited the track in March, said the cars would suffer more than in Europe and be more susceptible to breakdowns. **********Also a challenge will be the daily rains. **********Races in Europe are rarely stopped for the rain, but, said Hermann Tilke, the track designer, ""if a monsoon comes, the race has to stop."" **********While the weather is out of their control, race organizers say they have solved one potential problem: attendance. **********Organizers had worried that the race could face the same woes as a Grand Prix motorcycle event staged by Malaysia in April. Crowd turnout was poor, and the series will not return next year. **********To prevent those problems, Mr. Ecclestone installed a Frenchman with Formula One experience, Philippe Gurdjian, to promote the event. **********Mr. Mahathir, for his part, has been marketing the product locally. This week was declared National Motor Sports Week in Malaysia. **********While there appeared to be relatively few spectators in the grandstands during practice sessions Friday, organizers say they have sold 65,000 tickets and are expecting crowds of 80,000 to 100,000 on race day. **********If the weather holds up, the fans may be in for a good show since Sunday's race could decide who wins this year's Formula One championship. **********While it did not rain during the Friday practice sessions, the sky was cloudy and the track was wet for at least half of the two one-hour sessions. **********Jacques Villeneuve set the fastest time in practice. ""It's a very simple track to drive on,"" he said. ""It's fun."""

Putin, the hawkish prime minister closely associated with the war. **********Western governments, especially the United States, have run into many difficulties in trying to deal with the new Russia: corrupt tycoons, die-hard Communists and an enfeebled president. But now they have found themselves squarely at odds with the Russian public. **********The widespread backing for the war -- and Mr. Putin's personal popularity, which soared as the situation in Chechnya got more brutal -- not only reduces the already minuscule chance for a political accommodation in Chechnya. It also suggests a broad shift in Russian public sentiment toward a more nationalist, if pro-capitalist, stance. **********''Putin will take this as an endorsement of his policy and wage the war even more fiercely,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, a political analyst. ''Democracy is not a guarantee against many nasty things.'' **********Certainly, many Russians had reason to be concerned that Chechnya had turned into a lawless region of marauders and kidnappers. The trouble in the Caucasus region began in August when Islamic militants stormed into neighboring Dagestan. Later, apartment houses in Moscow and other Russian cities were blown up by terrorists, acts for which most Russians believe Chechen militants are responsible. **********Mr. Putin also benefits from the Russian political psyche that hankers for a strongman: a political leader who can bring the country's disputatious regions to heel, force people to work and ensure that pensions are paid on time. **********As a former intelligence chief, untainted by allegations of corruption and relatively new to politics, Mr. Putin seems to fit that bill. **********But the way in which the current Chechnya campaign was turned into a major election-year asset, with a largely sympathetic Russian press playing down reports of civilian and military casualties while highlighting the army's heroic advances on the battlefield, was not supposed to be in the democracy lesson book. **********In the past, Russian and Soviet military operations were perceived by the West as the adventures of secretive cabals, which the public would oppose if only it could. **********When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Western governments assailed the Communist Party's ruling Politburo, and when the Yeltsin government dispatched the Russian Army into Grozny during the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, critics blamed a small Kremlin clique. **********This time, whether the Chechnya campaign is considered a just fight against terrorism or a politically expedient war that has needlessly endangered civilians, it is different in this respect: many Russians believe that it is necessary and, as in any democratic society, share in the responsibility. **********The election returns indicate as much. The Unity Party, which received 23 per cent of the votes cast for political parties, was established by the Kremlin only months ago. What gave it strength was its endorsement by Mr. Putin. **********The Union of Right Forces, a pro-capitalist group, also did better than expected, with 9 percent. Led by Sergei V. Kiriyenko, a former prime minister, it received an enormous boost when Mr. Putin publicly praised its economic program. **********Probably few voters knew what the economic program consisted of, but the campaign ads of a smiling Mr. Kiriyenko meeting with Mr. Putin was enough to bring in the votes. **********By contrast, the only party that even remotely challenged the wisdom of the war, Yabloko, led by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, fared poorly at the polls, garnering only 6 percent. **********''There was a chance to change the situation in 1999,'' Mr. Yavlinsky said ruefully on Sunday night. ''But it did not happen. War, it seems, is a narcotic that can drown out all political problems.'' **********The election results present a mixed message for the West. The good news is that the success of Unity and the Union of Right Forces broke the Communists' control of Parliament. That in turn increased the prospects for legislation to encourage investment and reform the tax system. **********The bad news is that Russia's economic reformers are no longer the fair-haired boys they used to be, at least in the eyes of the West. To boost their parliamentary fortunes, they talked tougher than Russia's most hard-line generals and turned a deaf ear to the Western officials they once courted. **********''Destruction of terrorism in Chechnya is, of course, the basis of continued support for Putin,'' declared Anatoly B. Chubais, the former Kremlin aide and architect of the Union of Right Forces' strategy. **********And much of the Russian public seems to be hostile to Western opinion, at least if the voting results are any guide. But having urged Russia to embrace democracy, Western spokesmen could only applaud the elections -- if not the message they sent regarding the war. **********That will not necessarily stop Washington from complaining about Russian policy on Chechnya. But it left officials in Washington groping for a response today. **********''It says something about the system in Russia,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, ''where elections are becoming more common, where the turnout is so strong and the democratic institutions, regardless of, you know, what you think of who won and who lost, have become accepted as the norm, and that's a positive.'' **********Asked whether the election results, and their endorsement of the Chechnya policy, would make it harder for the United States to bring pressure to bear on the Kremlin over the war, Mr. Lockhart said: ''Well, I don't know. I mean, obviously the domestic political audience may view it different than the international community does.''"

''The market was disappointed, and so were many people in the Ministry of Finance.'' **********The ministry had been pressing the central bank to further loosen what the bank already considers a loose monetary policy -- in the interest of weakening the yen, which surged to its strongest levels in more than three years last week. **********The yen's strength reflects a belief among global investors that Japan's economy is emerging from a prolonged slump, which has increased demand for the currency. But a strong yen also makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and could forestall economic recovery. **********''A stronger yen means exporters get hurt, they cut wages, their employees cut their spending and that hampers economic growth,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. **********The United States Treasury has also pressed the Japanese central bank for a looser monetary policy as a condition for American participating in any coordinated effort to weaken the yen. **********The currency markets had been betting that the Japanese would move in some way to dilute the yen's value by expanding the money supply, perhaps by pumping more excess cash into the money market than the one trillion yen now available. That expectation had pushed down the currency on Monday and helped rally Japanese stock prices. **********The bank did not, in fact, rule out an expansion of the money supply, but it repeated its official position that such additional liquidity would have a short-term impact at best. ''The Bank of Japan cannot resort to policies if it cannot explain their effects,'' it said. **********The central bank has steadfastly maintained that it has gone as far as it can to pump liquidity into the economy, but to no avail. It has pushed short-term interest rates close to zero, and still, commercial banks are reluctant to lend and prospective borrowers to borrow. It has intervened in the currency markets, selling yen nine times since June to push down the currency, and yet the yen has moved higher and higher. **********Mr. Feldman said he thought the central bank would now begin laying the groundwork for an an easing of monetary policy, with the aim of expanding the money supply, but without appearing to make a 180-degree turn away from its stated opposition to such an approach. **********''The issue of saving face for the Bank of Japan is quite important,'' he wrote in a report to investors. Referring to Masaru Hayami, the bank's chief, he said, ''Governor Hayami has taken a strong stance against easing, and he must be satisfied that the Bank of Japan is not being bullied and does not appear to be bullied.'' **********Mr. Hayami has charted an independent course for the central bank since he took over as head of its policy board last year, when the bank was declared free from the Finance Ministry and the ruling political party. But he has had to fight the bank's former masters every step of the way, and in the process, has been accused of stubbornness and inflexibility. There has been speculation Mr. Hayami will step down, but he seems firmly committed to his job."

View, Envoy Did Not Lie to House","In State Dept. View, Envoy Did Not Lie to House"," **********The State Department released internal documents this evening showing that it had concluded that a senior diplomat, who is the new special envoy to the Balkans, did not lie to Congress about death squads in Haiti. But the agency admonished him for not giving complete testimony. **********In a letter to the diplomat, James F. Dobbins, last October, the department's personnel office said that he had testified in ''good faith,'' and that his answers to the House Committee on International Relations three years ago were ''technically correct.'' But the personnel office said he may have shown ''poor judgment'' and was ''not responsive.'' **********As a result, Mr. Dobbins was issued a letter of admonishment, which is not a formal disciplinary action, will not be put in his file and will be destroyed after a year. **********The personnel office acted after reviewing a report by the State Department's inspector general. The inspector general accused Mr. Dobbins of giving testimony that was ''incomplete, misleading and possibly perjurious,'' and of failing to exercise the integrity expected of a senior Executive Branch officer, according to a two-page unclassified summary of the inspector's report. **********It was not clear how the department offices had reached such divergent views. The inspector general's office could not be reached for comment this evening. **********The problems for Mr. Dobbins, who has recently been named as the State Department's special envoy to the Balkans, arose out of testimony he gave to a Congressional committee looking at Haiti policy. **********During the testimony, he was asked many questions about an F.B.I. inquiry into the murder of a prominent conservative Haitian, Mireille Durocher Bertin. There were allegations that she had been killed by officials in the Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had the support of the Clinton Administration. **********In response to a question from Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, Mr. Dobbins said that he had not been formally briefed by the F.B.I., and that the agency was still conducting its investigation. **********This answer was ''truthful but not responsive,'' a Deputy Assistant Secretary for personnel, Janice F. Bay, said in the letter of admonishment. **********The F.B.I. had informally briefed the State Department. **********After the hearing, Warren Christopher, who was then Secretary of State, wrote to Mr. Burton in Mr. Dobbins's defense, saying that he ''has, as you may know, a particularly distinguished record of service to five Administrations, Democrat and Republican,'' adding that he was willing to take ''on demanding and sometimes highly controversial assignments.''"

Jordan is now led by a 37-year-old ruler who has little experience of power, while a heavy debt burden has cast a shadow over a hoped-for economic revival, and tensions within the royal family still have the prospect to become a troublesome distraction. **********''King Abdullah is on more solid ground than his father was in 1952,'' a former Jordanian Cabinet Minister said, in a reference to the year that King Hussein took power, at a time of turmoil in the Arab world. ''But it's certainly shaky in some respects.'' **********Another former Minister offered this assessment when asked about the young man who was thrust into his position as next in line to the throne only in the final weeks of his father's life: ''He's not incapable. But he needs plenty of counsel and advice, and he's also going to need some outside help.'' **********By nearly every account, where Jordan is most vulnerable is in its economy, already suffering from high unemployment, low growth, and facing more than $8 billion in debt, an amount greater than its gross domestic product. **********There had been worries that nervousness over King Hussein's death could set off a crippling run on Jordan's currency, the dinar. For now, an American promise to speed payments of millions of dollars in economic aid to the kingdom appears to have averted that danger, said diplomats in the region. **********But the diplomats say that Jordan, an important stabilizing force in the Middle East, remains in urgent need of relief -- perhaps through the rescheduling of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt owed this year to Japan and Europe, or, preferably, through forgiveness, a step embraced by the United States in 1994, when it wiped away $700 million in Jordanian debt. **********Another hope that has been rekindled in Jordan is the prospect that Saudi Arabia or Kuwait might revive old generosities. Before the Persian Gulf war of 1991, those countries provided both aid and employment to Jordan, but both streams were all but eliminated as punishment for King Hussein's tilt to Iraq. **********At the time of the funeral and afterward, Saudi and Kuwaiti leaders have spoken of Jordan with fresh warmth. Diplomats in the region are watching closely to see if those remarks translate into any fresh sharing of wealth, although the Persian Gulf states may be less giving now because of depressed oil prices and their own economic troubles. **********A more distant but no less troublesome challenge for Jordan could come in relations with the Palestinians. On Friday, the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, in a surprise move, offered what he portrayed as a goodwill gesture to King Abdullah, saying that the Palestinians would welcome a future confederation with Jordan. **********Such an arrangement could bring economic benefits, but it might also carry political problems for Jordan, whose population already includes a large Palestinian majority. If a confederation were forged, Jordanians would become a much smaller minority, something that could add to the prospect of internal instability. **********In Jordan itself, what many citizens have been watching most intently is a drama unfolding in the royal family, which is still recovering from the shock of King Hussein's decision last month to dismiss his brother, Hassan, as Crown Prince, and to replace him with Abdullah, King Hussein's eldest son, who became King last Sunday. **********It was very much noticed that Prince Hassan did not join King Abdullah on Tuesday in receiving mourners on the day after the state funeral, and that when he did appear in public, he did not wear a kaffiyeh, the traditional sign of mourning that was worn all week by Abdullah and King Hussein's other four sons. **********The next day, Prince Hassan did stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the new King, and he pledged in a public letter to his nephew, ''I will not hold back love, or knowledge or support.'' In a separate show of unity, King Hussein's widow, Queen Noor, received female mourners alongside not only Princess Rania, King Abdullah's wife, but also Princess Muna, the King's British-born mother, whom Hussein divorced in 1971. **********But associates of Prince Hassan say he remains bitter at his removal just two weeks before he himself would have become King, and at a lack of sympathy shown by the Jordanian people, many of whom turned against him after his dismissal. And as evidence of trouble within the family, Jordanians close to the royal court pointed out that neither Prince Hassan's wife, Princess Sarvath, nor their three daughters had joined other members of the royal family at King Hussein's bedside as the monarch lay dying. **********Linking Jordan's personal and practical problems is the fact that Prince Hassan had come to be seen by many Jordanians and foreign investors as a figure capable of putting Jordan's economy on firmer footing. **********There remain rumors that Prince Hassan, 51, might leave the country, as his father, King Talal, did in 1952 after being forced to cede the throne to Hussein. His associates say that is unlikely; they say he feels no animosity toward either King Abdullah or the Crown Prince, Hamzah, 18, who is Queen Noor's eldest son, and feels bound to Jordan by duty and family ties. But they say he is having a difficult time adjusting to the idea of playing a peripheral role in a country he served for 34 years as the King's closest adviser and confidant. **********During his reign, King Hussein installed a new prime minister on the average of once every 11 months, and diplomats say they expect King Abdullah to move soon to install his own prime minister, as a sign that a new era has begun. But such a move is not likely, they say, until after a 40-day mourning period ends, in mid-March."

""Now people are doing a good job of preventing serious injuries in the normal course of an accident, but we have injuries to the lower leg and to the face, which are not life-threatening, but that cost a lot of money to fix."" **********The economic cost of car accidents and a recent realization by car manufacturers that safety sells has led to a worldwide proliferation of crash-test programs and research funded by both governments and private industry. **********About 400,000 people are killed and 12 million injured in car accidents around the world every year. In the United States alone, car injuries cost $150 billion a year, according to the Department of Transportation. **********But one of the drawbacks to this crash-testing boom is an imbroglio of test standards and dummy designs that has led to an uneven level of safety and a higher cost for cars as manufacturers spend money to meet a multiplicity of crash-test standards. **********""There are a lot of different crash dummies around the world,"" said Gordie Morgan, director technical marketing of First Technology Safety Systems Inc., a Plymouth, Michigan-based, British-owned company that makes 80 percent of the world's dummies. ""But human beings are basically the same. So there's a big push to harmonize."" **********With names like Hybrid III, CRABI, BioSID, BioRID, EuroSID-1, SID-II and THOR, the dummy population may be an indecipherable jungle of bureaucratic acronyms, but behind it all is a highly complex science called biomechanics, the goal of which is simple: to save lives. **********In the early days, a crash test basically involved a car moving along a sled into a wall. The steering wheel was not supposed to move back farther than a certain distance. The first dummy was a primitive number called Sierra Sam, designed in 1949 for the U.S. Air Force to test ejection seats. **********Today's plethora of tests โ frontal, rear, offset, roll-over, and side-impact, among others โ measure how much a car's structure deforms or collapses, and how much intrusion there is into the passenger compartment. The tests measure the effectiveness of the restraint systems, such as seatbelts and airbags, to see if the dummy hits its head on the A-pillar, the B-pillar, the roof rail, or the door frame, or if the dummy slides under the airbag or hits its knees, chest or other parts of its body. **********The crash barrier at the test hall of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent organization based in Virginia and funded mostly by car insurance companies, is 320,000 pounds (145,000 kilograms) of concrete and steel. It sits on a cushion of air and may be moved around for different crash configurations. An aluminum honeycomb facing is sometimes used to mimic the front end of another vehicle. The speed of the propulsion system that drives the vehicles may be varied within a 10th of a mile an hour. A total of 750,000 watts of lighting allow for high-speed, frame-by-frame filming to analyze the crash digitally. **********Dummies are fully clothed in order to slide on the car seat as a human might. Rear impact dummies have complex spinal columns; side impact dummies have realistic rib cages; dummies for measuring foot and lower leg accidents have Achilles' tendons. **********- **********ELECTRONIC sensors providing sometimes more than 180 data channels are scattered throughout the dummy's body and attached through an umbilical cord to a black box, like an airplane's flight recorder, which stays inside the car during the crash. The box provides the sensors with power and records the signals at up to 20,000 times per second, with up to nearly 40,000 items of data for later analysis in a computer. This data is then compared to data established beforehand from work on human corpses by biomechanical researchers on what a bone can take before it breaks. **********Today, a fully instrumented dummy costs about $150,000. And there is now a whole family of them: a 1-year-old, a 3-year-old, a 6-year-old, a female dummy that is also used for teenagers and a male dummy. First Technology Safety Systems is now working on a pregnant dummy. The most common male adult is what they call a ""50th percentile"" male, representing an average male, 178 centimeters (5 feet 10 inches) tall and weighing 76.5 kilograms (170 pounds). But there's also a 95th percentile male representing the heavyweights. **********""What you're always looking for in next generation dummies is to make them more representative of human beings,"" said Julie Rochman, vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. **********Two projects aim to create the most lifelike dummies yet. One is by GESAC, which is under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to build the next generation frontal impact dummy called THOR (Test Device for Human Occupant Restraint). The other is the OCATD (Occupant Classification Anthropomorphic Test Device) being developed by First Technology Safety Systems with funding provided by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, comprised of 11 of the world's leading car manufacturers. **********THOR has a spine and pelvis that allow it to sit in different positions, slouching or upright. Its sensors provide more injury measurements than those available on Hybrid III. **********OCATD uses a replica of a human skeleton made out of plastic. Encompassing that is a flesh-like material, also made of a kind of plastic but designed on the basis of several tissue and muscular studies to ensure its stiffness and compliance properties are humanlike. One of the main features is the buttocks bone and profile, which will be used in a new car-seat sensor system that will tell the airbag what size and shape of human is sitting on the seat and whether or not, or precisely how to deploy in an accident. **********IN PART to solve the problem of the dangers of airbags and small occupants, legislation is beginning to move in the United States as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adds the whole family of dummies to the crash-test regulations over the next few months. **********In Europe, after regulations remained static for two decades, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) โ a Geneva-based organization composed of most of the world's automobile associations and representing 100 million motorists โ lobbied for better legislation over the past few years. Then the FIA and the governments of Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands and later France created the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP), which tests the best-selling new model cars in Europe with a frontal and side-impact test and a pedestrian safety test. **********But in the most ambitious project yet to harmonize dummies, the International Standardization Organization in Switzerland is overseeing a worldwide effort, called WorldSID, to design a single side-impact dummy. **********There are now at least four different side-impact dummies in use. A prototype dummy is expected next autumn. **********Marc Beusenberg, director of a Canadian company called Biokinetics and Associates Ltd., is project manager for WorldSID's design team. The team is made up of half a dozen of the world's top dummy builders. ""We are trying to build a dummy that is more humanlike than any of the existing dummies,"" Mr. Beusenberg said. ""So it is not just the political issue or harmonization of standards issue to this, but also an improved safety aspect to the development."" **********WorldSID owes its existence partly to a flurry of changes in legislation as governments began to recognize the need for tighter automobile safety regulations. **********In Europe, the FIA began studying government crash tests to learn how to save racing car drivers' lives after the death of Ayrton Senna, the Formula One world champion, in 1994. **********""We decided to look at road cars,"" said Max Mosley, president of the FIA, ""because all the governments had been working on this and we thought there must be a great deal we can learn from it. We discovered to our horror that there had been absolutely nothing since 1974."" **********The New Car Assessment Program has existed in the United States since the late 1970s, and in Australia since the late 1980s. Japan started a program in the mid-1990s, but Europe has lagged. **********Unfortunately real car crashes happen in myriad ways that no number of tests can mimic, which makes some critics say they are a waste of time. **********""There are two things you can do,"" said Steve Mitchell, an engineer at Kayser-Threde, a German company that makes the industry's most popular crash-test black box. **********""You can say there's no way I can know what kind of crash Mr. X is going to have, at what speed, what angle, what he's going to hit, or what is going to hit him. And you can throw your hands in the air and say it's all too difficult and do nothing. Or you can say, we understand that this may not be representing Mr. X's crash, but it's a start."" **********BRAD SPURGEON is on the staff of the International Herald Tribune."

Jesper Koll, chief economist and managing director at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. in Tokyo, spoke recently with Miki Tanikawa about the prospects for Japanese investments. **********- **********Q. What is your feeling about the recovery of the Japanese economy and Japanese investments? **********A. I am totally optimistic. Until last summer, the operative word from bankers business leaders, bureaucrats, politicians was ""muddle through."" The Japanese economy, corporate structure, corporate governance, in one way or another, were going to muddle through, and this has ended. **********You see the real spirit of activism that comes through on the part of the entire ruling elite of Japan. The key issue about future prospect of the economy are indeed that you have โ yes, you have a lot of structural problems, excess capacity and excess labor โ but these problems are no longer denied. **********In January 1999, MITI [the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry] issued an industrial priority list and they touched upon the untouchable. They mentioned that excess capacity needs to be reduced and that leverage needs to be cut and excess labor needs to be washed out of the system. **********That's absolutely incredible. You have the untouchable and the unthinkable now being mentioned in the paper and the Obuchi government is putting into place concrete measures to tackle these issues, for example, by introducing debt forgiveness, introducing debt-for-equity swaps, by changing the bankruptcy laws and pushing through accounting rule changes. **********- **********Q. How do they help the economy? **********A. I think the key issue is that you have a government that runs a very aggressive fiscal expansion policy and this in effect is going to cushion the negative impact that comes from the restructuring. And it is exactly the record 60 trillion yen [$575 billion] banking bailout package that creates the room for companies to restructure and banks to improve their balance sheet. **********The key issue is that the safety net has been established and that the counterforce against the deflation pool from restructuring has been created by the public sector. And that's why I want you to get optimistic. **********Q. These macro policies seem to be a relief to existing players. **********A. That's exactly where it gets interesting. I think existing players are going to dwindle rapidly. You have dinosaurs in Japanese economy, particularly in the chemical sector or even in telecommunications, where you have old companies that were used to just feeding on the trough of the protective banking system or just feeding on the public sector and now these companies are actually being cut loose or cut off from the main bank system or cut off from of the keiretsu system [of corporate groupings], and, as a result of that, I think, among the established players, there are going to be a lot more deaths, a lot more problems than people are anticipating at this point in time. **********And I think that in the future, things will be very simple and very straightforward. No. 1, you have the permanent restructuring juggernauts of Japan. These are the Nifty 30s, Nifty 50s like Sony, Matsushita, Hitachi, who have basically for the last 50 to 60 years constantly restructured the business and because the corporate managers have the will to be the best in the segment in the industry they are in, these companies will continue to do extremely well. **********But much more exciting is the fact that the differentiation between the good and the bad is starting to accelerate. You have inefficient players that are pushed aside and thereby freeing up room and freeing up market share for new and efficient players to capture new markets because inefficient players are dying out. **********Q. You mentioned more ""deaths."" Tell us a little about ""births."" **********A. It is going to be interesting. Right now in aggregate you are still in the phase of jobless recovery that is going to stay with us over the next year to a year and a half. However, you are starting to see new entrepreneurs are coming to the fore. They are dominated at the moment in the financial industry and the high-tech industry. That's where the entrepreneurial opportunities are, that's where deregulation by the government is creating space for companies to prosper. Look, for example, at Hikari Tsushin, run by a 35-year-old president who founded the company in 1988 selling mobile phones, as NTT got deregulated. It is today a multimillion-dollar company. It has a venture-capital arm, plugged into a dominant position in Japanese cable TV as well as continuing very strongly with anything that deals with mobile computing. **********- **********Q. Do you see any encouraging signs as far as attitudes, motives and aspirations of Japanese entrepreneurs? **********A. Very much so. You have got Japanese entrepreneurs focusing on increasing returns to shareholders. **********I believe that in this respect the import of Nasdaq to Japan next year is absolutely key because the problem with venture capital companies and entrepreneurialism had been the fact that it didn't really pay for you and I to set up your own little company because there was no exit strategy. You could not bet on the listing because the average age of the company before it got listed on the stock exchange before you cashed out was basically about 25 years. This is going to come down. **********The key point is that the focus of corporate entrepreneur is now to work hard, maximize profits, maximize shareholder value rather than the touchy-feely issues that were are involved with Japanese style capitalism. **********Q. It seems that more foreigners are taking position with small-cap Japanese companies. **********A. Oh, yes. Investment companies have started thinking about venture capital investments here in Japan. I believe that Japanese private equity is the best asset class in the world. **********Q. Is there enough talent for new entrepreneurs in Japan? Isn't the education here unconducive to teaching people to become entrepreneurs? **********A. Talking about education is like talking about breathing. Are the Japanese creative and entrepreneurial? You bet they are. Just look at the plethora of companies that have being set up. Until now they have been dwarfed by the fact that the large players were able to spread like cancer throughout the economy by setting up a whole galaxy of subsidiaries. That just grabbed the market share and strangled [potentially] successful entrepreneurs. **********Q. What companies should investors watch in the Japanese market? You already mentioned Hikari Tsushin. **********A. Pasona Softbank Inc., for one. It has a smart, charismatic leader [Yasuyuki Nambu, a famed entrepreneur]."

''But we are arranging with Taiwanese churches and business groups here to find a way to get the contributions and help to Taiwan.'' **********But even as the earthquake dominated talk at the restaurants and businesses of Flushing, Queens -- the center of Taiwan immigration in the New York area -- concern for the victims extended beyond that hub to Chinatowns in Manhattan and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where a vast majority of immigrant residents are from mainland China. **********Leaders of Chinese organizations in all three boroughs said the political lines that have long divided the communities have blurred over time, and never more so than in times of crisis, at least for the short term. **********Paul Mak, president of the Brooklyn Chinese American Association, a social services agency, said his organization and business groups in Sunset Park have started discussing ways to raise money for a relief effort. ''Even though the majority of people here are from mainland China, the effect was so devastating it's something that everyone would want to contribute to,'' he said. **********The Chinatown Consolidated Benevolent Association, an organization that represents immigrants from Guangdong Province in southern China but has long had ties to the nationalist government in Taiwan, plans to announce a fund-raising campaign today. ''As compatriots, we are all the same,'' said Yut Y. Eng, the president of the association. **********Despite the unifying force of compassion that has sparked various relief efforts, it appeared that the drives would proceed on separate tracks. ''The response will be there from throughout the Chinese community,'' said David Chen, the executive director of the Chinatown Planning Council, a social services agency with branches in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. ''But given the politics of Chinatown and the Chinese community, there will probably be all sorts of circles doing the same thing. And who knows, there probably will be a little friendly competition over who can raise more money.'' **********Chinatown, for example, will have at least two different relief efforts. One will be from the association that represents Cantonese immigrants from Guangdong Province, and which has traditionally been pro-Taiwan, and one from groups representing the recent influx of immigrants from Fujian Province, who have more ties to mainland China. **********''On the whole China issue, the polarization is really with political leaders and not with the people anymore,'' Mr. Chen said. ''Even the staunchest pro-nationalist Chinese are investing in mainland China, so interests have become very mixed.'' **********Even Flushing, a community that started attracting Taiwan immigrants in the late 1970's because they felt they did not fit in with the Cantonese-speaking immigrants in Chinatown, has evolved as its population  from mainland China has grown. **********While Flushing has long celebrated the Nationalist Chinese Revolution of 1911 on Oct. 10 -- a major holiday in Taiwan -- it has ignored dates that commemorate the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. But this year, for the first time, a parade celebrating the Oct. 1 founding of the Communist Government will be held. **********''There are many political differences,'' said Che-Tsao Huang, a communications professor at York College in Queens and a Taiwan immigrant who is organizing the parade. ''But by and large people in Taiwan really view themselves as Chinese, and there are many people, like me, who believe that Taiwan and China are one and should be one.'' **********His philosophy of unity, he added, applied to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and to a crisis like the Taiwanese earthquake. ''It goes for good times and bad,'' he said."

Wetherell played poker with friends on the first Thursday night of each month. Two years ago, as his Internet investments started taking more of his time, he had to give up poker. But the 44-year-old chairman and chief executive of the investment firm CMGI Inc. is holding his cards close to his vest once again -- this time in a gamble that could become the first hostile takeover battle in the short history of Internet commerce. **********In a flurry of moves meant to disrupt the pending merger of the Web ''portal'' Lycos Inc. with the Internet holdings of Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc., Mr. Wetherell resigned from the Lycos board last week. He then promptly hired Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to seek other buyers for Lycos, in which Mr. Wetherell's firm holds 18.5 percent, the largest single stake. Potential acquirers might include CMGI itself, which has invested in scores of Web start-ups over the last five years. **********The uncertainties may have contributed to a selloff of both companies' stocks on Friday -- along with investor disappointment that CMGI did not announce a hoped-for stock split when it reported second-quarter earnings late Thursday. In a stampede of apparent profit taking, CMGI's shares fell $18.125, to close at $164 in Nasdaq trading, while Lycos shares fell $10.375, to close at $98.625. **********The battle is over a company that Mr. Wetherell himself founded. In 1994 Lycos was a noncommercial Web site for conducting searches based on software developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. Through CMGI, Mr. Wetherell bought the technology for $2 million and hired a former Wang Laboratories salesman, Robert J. Davis, as the first employee of Lycos Inc., which is now based in Waltham, Mass. **********Mr. Davis, who became the chief executive, took the company public in April 1996. Mr. Wetherell watched Lycos mushroom into a company with a share price of $127.25 and a market value of nearly $6 billion, just before the USA Networks deal was announced on Feb. 9. **********By many measures, when Mr. Davis and Mr. Diller announced their plan to merge Lycos with the Internet operations of USA Networks, it completed an ideal cycle for a venture capitalist like Mr. Wetherell -- from start-up to stock offering to merger. The agreement, a complex stock swap, valued Lycos at $6.6 billion. That meant CMGI's initial modest investment was now worth about $1.2 billion. And at first, Mr. Wetherell said he supported the deal. **********But when investors turned cold on the complex terms, which seemed to many to favor Mr. Diller, the Lycos stock price plunged more than 31 percent in two days, to $87.25. That reduced the company's market value to $4.42 billion. Mr. Wetherell began wavering, soon called for a renegotiation of the merger pact, and, then, last week, took more drastic steps. **********''In its present construct, I am opposed to the deal,'' Mr. Wetherell said in an interview last Thursday. ''As far as I know, in the history of acquisitions, no stock of an acquired company has gone down by that much so soon. And the more I've analyzed the deal, the more I've found difficulties with pieces of it.'' **********He says he has a number of options, including coming up with a counterbid to buy back the rest of Lycos, perhaps with a media or technology partner. ''We're taking a fresh approach,'' he said. **********In other words, Lycos is now in play. And if Mr. Wetherell resumes control of it, he does not rule out significant changes in management and strategy. **********With the stock market value of Lycos now down to $4.2 billion, a CMGI takeover is more affordable than it would have been in early February. Yet the value of the original deal -- even after the initial two-day stock slump -- now looks a lot better than it did. But people who know Mr. Wetherell say his motives may not be purely financial. **********''Everyone is looking at the numbers, but it's also about the people,'' said Margaret Heffernan, chief executive of Zinezone.com, an on-line magazine of which CMGI is the majority owner. Ms. Heffernan and others who know Mr. Davis and Mr. Wetherell say their relationship has deteriorated over time. **********Mr. Davis declined to comment, but Lycos issued a statement saying, ''Bob Davis and Lycos remain committed to the transaction with USA Networks.'' As for the CMGI chairman's resignation from the board, the statement said, Mr. Davis and Lycos ''appreciate David Wetherell's contribution to the company.'' **********Even before Mr. Davis struck an agreement with Mr. Diller, some sort of major Lycos deal was said to be imminent -- rumors that were swapped on most major on-line investment sites. Driven by such speculation, the already stratospheric stock of Lycos doubled again in a matter of weeks in early 1999, soaring as high as $145. By the time Lycos and USA Networks announced their deal, an already sizable takeover premium was built into the price -- bolstering Mr. Diller's reluctance to offer a big premium in the merger agreement. **********But Mr. Wetherell insists that price is not the only issue. He said it was a mistake for Mr. Davis to concede majority voting rights in the combined company to Mr. Diller's company, and he no longer thinks that USA Networks is the right partner strategically. **********''I understand Disney's model with the Go network,'' Mr. Wetherell said, referring to the Walt Disney Company's new Web service, which Mr. Diller and Mr. Davis have cited as a motive for the USA Networks-Lycos deal. **********''ABC News can drive traffic to ABC.com, and ESPN can drive traffic to ESPN.com,'' Mr. Wetherell continued. ''But USA doesn't have the same reach. How much traffic can USA Networks drive to Lycos?'' **********Mr. Diller has dismissed Mr. Wetherell's moves as maneuvers rather than long-term strategies. **********So who is David Wetherell, this executive whose name until recently was little heard outside the Internet investment world but who is now taking on one of the media industry's best-known mogul? **********Mr. Wetherell grew up in Connecticut and Florida, before attending Ohio Wesleyan University, where he majored in mathematics. By his own account, he has a ''facility with numbers.'' And colleagues are often awestruck by his ability to work complex financial models in his head during negotiations. **********In 1986, Mr. Wetherell was an obscure software industry executive when he engineered a leveraged buyout of a 20-year-old company, the College Marketing Group, that rented out mailing lists of college professors. He took the company public as CMG Information Services Inc. in 1994, by which time it was profitable enough to finance other investments. These included Lycos, as well as a little company called Booklink that Mr. Wetherell scooped up for $900,000 and sold 10 months later to America Online for about $70 million in stock. **********''We then had more money than we knew what to do with,'' Mr. Wetherell recalled. **********He soon had inquiries from the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation, which each bought 4.9 percent stakes in the company. **********Soon, CMG Information Services (which changed its name to CMGI last December) was an active investment company, setting up At Ventures, the investment arm of CMGI that attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in fresh venture capital and led to big hits -- like CMGI's approximately $6 million investment in Geocities, a popular on-line community Web site that is in the process of being sold to Yahoo, netting CMGI a profit of about $1 billion. **********CMGI is now selling one of its operating companies, CMG Direct, for $24 million to a New York marketing firm, SMGI. After that, CMGI will more closely resemble a pure investment company -- a characteristic that could prompt the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider reclassifying CMGI as a mutual fund concern. That change would have a significant impact on its financial reporting requirements and potentially negative tax consequences for its shareholders. **********''We'd like to avoid that,'' Mr. Wetherell said. The company has until October to tell the S.E.C. how it plans to clear up the ambiguity. **********CMGI's stock, which was trading around $8 a share in January 1998, has been on an Internet surge in the last 15 months. Last Monday alone, it rose $47.50, to close at nearly $200 before giving up most of those gains as the week's events unfolded. **********Mr. Wetherell said he expected to invest in two new Internet companies every month and bring perhaps two dozen or more of his investments public within a couple of years. Among the attributes he looks for when choosing among the thousands of Internet business plans he reviews each year is whether a company would have ''synergy'' with the rest of the CMGI portfolio. **********By some accounts, this synergy is extremely hard to achieve. Mr. Wetherell contends that he runs his portfolio of start-up firms somewhat like a Japanese keiretsu, an amalgamation of firms with interlocking investments and business relationships that help each other in the marketplace. But there have been many instances of friction and outright rebellion among CMGI's offspring. **********''If you build companies this way, you have to hire entrepreneurial people,'' Ms. Heffernan said. ''It's the nature of the model that companies are going to want to break away.'' **********This appears to be exactly what happened with Lycos. In an attempt to control his own destiny, Mr. Davis of Lycos held negotiations with many giant media companies in the months leading up to the USA Networks deal. Mr. Davis was ''flying solo on this,'' Mr. Wetherell said. **********In the end, the Lycos showdown may come down to the cards that Mr. Wetherell is holding in his hand. Many Wall Street analysts predict that if Mr. Diller responds by renegotiating the terms, then Mr. Wetherell will turn back to supporting the merger. By that reckoning, Mr. Wetherell's sharp criticism and his hiring of an investment banking firm are part of a bluffing strategy. **********So far, Mr. Diller has said that he will not budge. **********But as any experienced poker player knows, the most difficult bluff to call is one from a player with a winning streak and a hoard of cash. And Mr. Wetherell has both."

He could be politically tone-deaf, as when he initially resisted efforts in Congress a year and half ago to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service. At times he was stubborn and turf-conscious, traits on display in his continuing battle with the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to preserve the Treasury Department's powers as a bank regulator. **********But the enduring reality about Robert E. Rubin is that he was consistently the most influential voice in shaping economic policy through more than six years in which the economy performed remarkably well, bringing great benefits to the United States and incalculable political advantage to his boss, President Clinton. **********By the time he announced his resignation today as Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin stood second only to Mr. Greenspan as the embodiment of American economic solidity in a world that has been roiled by financial instability and accompanying political upheaval. ''It's hard to argue with success, and his success has been extraordinary,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. **********Mr. Rubin both reflected and encouraged the economic ethos of the 1990's, bringing to Washington from his background on Wall Street a deep understanding of the power of the financial markets and a distrust of ideology. **********Mr. Rubin is certain to rank among the most important Treasury Secretaries of the last century, if only because of the magnitude of two crises that confronted him: Mexico's near-meltdown in 1994-95 and the financial turmoil that swept out of Asia and into other regions of the world in the last two years. **********In both cases, his responses -- though successful in the sense that the problems were ultimately contained -- remain the subject of vigorous debate among economists. Critics say he achieved his goal of calming global currency and stock markets at the cost of plunging millions of people in developing nations into poverty through the policies he prescribed of high interest rates and reduced government spending. Others say his advocacy of the free flow of capital across national borders helped set off the financial crises two years ago. **********But his most enduring legacy may prove to be his success in convincing Wall Street and much of the country -- as well as his own party -- that fiscal and monetary austerity could be compatible with the progressive aims of a Democratic Administration. As chairman of the National Economic Council when President Clinton first took office, Mr. Rubin played a critical role in persuading him that a credible deficit-reduction policy would lower interest rates and create jobs. **********''He put fiscal austerity on the screen as one of the lodestars of economic policy,'' said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. **********Mr. Rubin also argued in favor of free trade against protectionist interest groups within the party. Despite a large and growing trade deficit, he maintained a policy of keeping the dollar strong, helping to hold down inflation and making the United States even more of a magnet for foreign investment. And he counseled a hands-off approach toward the Federal Reserve, giving Mr. Greenspan free rein on inflation. **********Given his Wall Street ties, as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, and his personal wealth, Mr. Rubin's leanings on social policy may seem surprisingly liberal. He cautioned against turning Social Security into a gamble on the stock market. He supported the 1993 tax increase on the wealthy that was at the heart of the Administration's early deficit-reduction efforts, and he fought Republican tax cuts with the argument that they did too little for working people and the poor. **********But for the most part Mr. Rubin was seen even by Republicans as a steady hand on the tiller, a market-oriented pragmatist who inspired confidence if not agreement with all his policies. **********Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, praised Mr. Rubin for having been ''a good stabilizing force in the world economy.'' **********Still, he had his share of critics. Stephen Moore, of the libertarian Cato Institute, said conservatives had always been wary of Mr. Rubin because of his willingness to raise taxes in 1993 and his unwillingness since then to cut them. ''He's got an anti-supply-side mentality, and it's always puzzled me why that is,'' Mr. Moore said. ''It may be guilt from making all that money.'' **********His performance on the world stage has come under even sharper review, and not just by conservatives. Although the bailout of Mexico that he orchestrated restored economic calm there, many economists think it may have planted the seeds of the Asian crisis that sprouted two and a half years later. **********The bailout's primary feature was to rescue investors who had bet on Mexican bonds and stood to lose fortunes. And that sent a signal to investors that they had nothing to fear from debt problems in emerging markets, some economists said, encouraging a further, large-scale flow of money into developing countries that their financial systems were unequipped to handle. **********Throughout his tenure, Mr. Rubin also encouraged the free flow of capital around the world by pressing countries to drop trade barriers and open their banking systems to global competition. In hindsight, even some former Clinton Administration officials said, they and Mr. Rubin may have missed the potential dangers of allowing investors to unleash huge pools of cash into less developed countries at the touch of a computer button. **********When Thai devaluation in July 1997 spread gradually throughout Asia and on to Russia and Latin America, Mr. Rubin took the lead in developing not just the Administration's response but also the International Monetary Fund's. Together, the United States and the fund imposed high interest rates and tight budget policies on countries mired in the crisis to restore currency stability and calm markets. But austerity sent the affected economies into deep economic slumps, from which many are only now emerging. **********But at least they are emerging, however tentatively. And perhaps most important for Mr. Rubin's reputation, the United States was never hit hard by either the crisis in Mexico or the global financial turmoil. **********Mr. Rubin came to the Administration a stranger to the ways of Washington and to Mr. Clinton. But it was a measure of the influence and respect he has gained that even before his departure was announced today, there were rumors that he would be selected to fill the only shoes in economic policy circles larger than his own -- those of Alan Greenspan, whose current term as Fed chairman expires in 13 months."

As a test of its suppleness, a genuine shatoosh can be pulled through a wedding ring (or packed in an evening bag in case of an after-supper chill). **********Long an almost sacred textile, the vaporous shatooshes were treasured by India's great dynasties. Often a bridal gift symbolizing purity, the scarf might subsequently coddle newborn babies and was usually handed down for generations. But the shatoosh could not remain a secret treasure once word of its existence leaked to the fashion capitals in the early 1990s. Handled only by initiates and the grandest cashmere dealers, the shatoosh caught on quickly, spreading through ever-widening circles from sophisticated travelers to a fashionable elite, then fashion acolytes and thence a bigger public. **********Prices were forbidding โ $2,000 apiece for rare all-white shatooshes and almost as much for the others in a gamut of solid colors โ earth-dyed hues and bright pastels as well as a range of grays and black. They enhanced any wardrobe, and perfectionists amassed 20 or 30. **********Men promptly succumbed, too, starting with politicians who wanted protection from the cold as they worked their constituencies. Bulky scarves too often gave candidates the fussy look of ""senior citizen, frail today and gone tomorrow."" In contrast, a thin, unshowy shatoosh had the effect of topping off a dressy look that seemed to give the wearer a reassuring aura of authority. **********For fashion conscious men, the shatoosh โ with its own cachet of exotic, slightly out-of-reach origin, absence of label and steep price tag โ quickly became a potent touch. As an understated fashion statement, a shatoosh had snob appeal as apparel that seemed non-fashion except to cognoscenti. **********But rising demand for shatooshes triggered unintended consequences when politics intervened. Today shatooshes are outlawed in many countries, including the United States, European Union nations and India, by virtue of an international conventional protecting the Himalayan antelope whose hair is made into the scarf. **********For generations, the wool for shatooshes was supplied to Kashmir by nomads in Chinese-controlled Tibet who gathered lumps of hair left on briars by grazing antelopes. **********But that system was overwhelmed, naturalists say, because of a conjunction of market forces. The growth of shatoosh sales coincided with a shortage in China of tiger parts, notably for the tiger penises that are sought-after aphrodisiacs in China. India's tiger population has risen in recent decades thanks to conservation programs, so a cross-border trade emerged in which Chinese traders, avid for tiger parts, turned to poachers to expand the production of mountain antelope hair โ by sending poaching parties with high-powered rifles and four-wheel-drive vehicles into the mountains to slaughter the animals. **********Alarmed by a system that threatened the species with extinction, India has started trying to enforce the 1995 world ban on shatooshes. **********Skepticism about India's real motives persists among analysts who note that the ban hits Muslim interests that oppose India's claims in Kashmir, and shatooshes are still available under the counter in India. But the ban โ like earlier crusades against animal skins in fashion โ has acquired the force of political correctness, energizing customs authorities and driving shatooshes out of dealers' showcases. **********More readily available than ever, however, are Kashmir's other super-cashmere scarves, pashminas. Woven from Kashmiri goat, pashminas are available from reputable dealers in all major cities โ at half the price of shatoosh. **********JOSEPH FITCHETT is on the staff of the International Herald Tribune."

Lederer, the founder of Budget Rent-a-Car and former husband of Ann Landers, the popular syndicated newspaper advice columnist, died of a heart attack Thursday at his home near London. He was 81. **********Born in Detroit, Mr. Lederer dropped out of school in the ninth grade to support his mother and sister after his father had died. He made his living as a salesman, selling everything from pens and pencils bearing advertising slogans to hats and logs and newspapers before starting Budget in the late 1950's, which grew into one of the nation's largest automobile rental companies. **********The company became popular in its early days by renting cars at lower prices than its competitors. It charged $5 a day and 5 cents a mile. It gained a following among a growing business and leisure travel market because of its practice of renting cars from offices outside of airports. Mr. Lederer is also credited as one of the first to apply franchising to the rental car industry. **********While selling hats in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1939, he met Ms. Landers, then known as Eppie (Esther Pauline) Friedman, who was engaged to another man and was shopping with her twin sister, Pauline, who later became known as the advice columnist Abigail Van Buren. The two were looking for wedding veils for their double wedding. **********In a statement yesterday, Ms. Landers said: ''Jules was a world class salesman. At age 21, he sold me on himself when I went to the T. S. Martin Department Store to buy a wedding veil. I was engaged to marry Lewis Dreyer, a Beverly Hills law student. I broke the engagement and married Jules in a double wedding with my twin sister, Pauline.'' **********The couple divorced in 1975, after 36 years of marriage. Informing readers of the decision in a column, which was shorter than most, Ms. Landers said, ''I left the white space as a memorial to one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.'' **********Mr. Lederer spent more than two decades living in Chicago. He also lived in Milwaukee, New Orleans and Sioux City, Iowa. He sold Budget to the Transamerica Corporation, an insurance company based in San Francisco, in 1968. He moved to London about 25 years ago after he separated from Ms. Landers. While in London, he remarried and the couple had a daughter, Anthea. **********Mr. Lederer is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two daughters, Margo Lederer Howard and Anthea Lederer; a brother, Sol; a sister, Madelyn Ferris; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren."

Enron wanted to ship about two million tons to India to fuel the Dabhol power plant it planned to build and to sell the rest in India and the Middle East. **********The two sides negotiated for three years. Meanwhile, Enron lined up other fuel suppliers for Dabhol, making the Qatar project less critical, a company spokesman, John Ambler, said. Enron allowed its letter of intent with Qatar, which was renewable each year, to expire in mid-1998, he said. **********''We were always in the early stages of planning with Qatar,'' Mr. Ambler said. ''We never progressed far enough to proceed with a formal contract.'' **********Also, other suppliers began selling liquefied natural gas in the Middle East and to India, making it more difficult for Enron to sell excess gas from the Qatar plant, he said. **********Qatar has 300 trillion cubic feet of natural-gas reserves, or 5.6 percent of the world's supply, more than any other country except Russia and Iran. Its North field contains 239 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas."

When the sun reached its noon zenith they closed their eyes and turned to it, stretching their palms upward to absorb the invigorating rays. **********''I am recharging with positive energy,'' said Alma Lourdes Gonzalez, a 23-year-old shopkeeper, who radiated calm contentment despite the huge throng pressing around her. ''I am opening my heart and body to let out the bad vibrations and fill up with everything positive.'' **********To honor what they took to be the last spring equinox before the millennium, multitudes of Mexicans across the country flocked on Sunday to pyramids and sacred shrines of their pre-Columbian ancestors, communing with the cosmos and soaking in force from the luminous sun that their forebears venerated. **********Pained by economic crises and political scandals, countless Mexicans are responding to the millennium's approach by summoning spiritual reserves and turning to mystical beliefs. Many have mixed their deep Catholic faith with a search for modern meaning in the civilizations that arose in these lands before the Spanish conquest. **********By far the largest celebration took place at the stately ruins at Teotihuacan, a city founded 1,900 years ago, which became a flourishing religious capital before fading mysteriously in the seventh century. **********The event here dwarfed any of the political demonstrations in Mexico in recent years. At least a thousand people spent the frigid night Saturday on a ledge near the top of the 200-foot-high Pyramid of the Sun, to be present at the all-important moment of sunrise. By midday the lines into the huge archeological park were so long that many thousands of people were not able to enter in time for the noon ceremony worshiping the sun. The highway to the site was clogged for miles. **********There were bricklayers and doctors, teen-agers and grandparents. What they seemed to have in common was a longing for relief from bad news about their political leaders, family pressures and the grind of work. **********''I'm gathering enough springtime energy to last me the whole year,'' said Maria de la Paz Hernandez, a 47-year-old lawyer who perched near the pyramid's top. ''The sun comes up all over the world. It will help me to think positive thoughts always and to ask for blessings for all of humanity and not just for myself.'' **********Nearby, Miguel Angel Kirel Macedo, 36, a painter who said he has been drawn in recent years to pre-Hispanic imagery, emerged serene from an hour of meditation. ''Our physical bodies activate an energy which is concentrated in the pyramid,'' he said. **********With its many enigmas, Teotihuacan is an appropriate setting for religious quest. After a century of excavation, it is not known exactly who lived here, what language they spoke or all the gods they worshiped. **********But the Mexicans here did not seem worried about the specifics of the cultures they sought to re-contact. Magdalena Perez, 40, a merchant, said she brought her two daughters to the equinox festivities ''to make sure they understand our Mayan past.'' The Maya did thrive in Mexico, but hundreds of miles to the south of Teotihuacan. **********Instead of scientific inquiry, the day brought a glorious potpourri of religions and re-creations of an idealized past. At 6:46 A.M., when the sun burst out from behind the black hills circling the ruin, a group of residents from surrounding villages who called themselves Tlahuizcalpantecutli (a phrase said to mean ''followers of the lord of the star of dawn'' in some pre-Hispanic language) held a welcoming ceremony at the pyramid's summit. **********They blew on conch shells, held up braziers of fire and copal incense and played on drums. On a cloth altar they laid out amaranth seeds, corn kernels and black beans for Tonatiuh, a sun diety. **********''We make these offerings to open the doors of the cosmos and receive this great sacred illumination in our hearts,'' said Ricardo Cervantes Cervantes, a taxi driver who led the proceedings. **********A long line formed for a spiritual healer in a tall black hat who waved a cluster of feathers and recited prayers to cleanse his patients. Humberto Garcia Lopez, a 20-year-old student, wept after the purification rite. He said he hoped it would bring peace to his family, torn by fights between his two teen-age brothers and his father. **********At the foot of the pyramid, dancers in ostrich feather headdresses and loincloths performed an Aztec ritual, although the Aztecs lived in Teotihuacan. A few feet away, a determined Catholic priest celebrated a traditional Sunday morning Mass for a small contingent. **********In fact, the last time Mexicans gathered in these numbers was when Pope John Paul II visited in January. Many of the visitors here said they had also been in the streets to see the Pope. They saw no tension between his strict Catholic teachings and their choice to spend a day garnering strength from the sun. **********''We were sent here by God,'' said Cruz Villegas Diaz, 46, a truck driver who led a delegation of Christians to greet the equinox. ''Our Lord will spill His light down on us and fortify the outer physical wrapping of our bodies to deepen our spiritual faith.''"

He was standing before two Turkish flags, and at one point he complained about the bright television lights. **********As Mr. Ocalan was undergoing his first interrogation, Turkey pressed its fight against Kurdish nationalists on military and political fronts. **********A spokesman for the Turkish Army said soldiers had killed five members of Mr. Ocalan's rebel force near the eastern town of Tunceli. **********Soldiers also struck guerrilla sanctuaries in northern Iraq. Several thousand troops entered Iraq on Wednesday, and today they pounded targets with missiles fired from American-made Cobra helicopters. **********The Turkish police raided offices of the People's Democracy Party, which is mainly Kurdish, and homes of its members in Istanbul and eastern provinces. According to human rights advocates, several hundred people were arrested. Prosecutors charge that the party functions as an arm of Mr. Ocalan's movement. **********Other Kurds were arrested in Istanbul after a night of disturbances in several neighborhoods, during which windows were smashed, firebombs thrown and cars attacked. **********News reports from Kenya suggested that the American and Israeli secret services had helped Turkish agents capture Mr. Ocalan. The United States has denied direct involvement, and Israeli officials said they were not involved in any way. **********''There was no Israeli role whatsoever,'' said Eli Shaked, the Israeli Consul in Istanbul. **********The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, reported that it had received a complaint from Mr. Ocalan's lawyers charging that the Turkish authorities were violating his rights to be tried fairly and protected from torture. It said the lawyers had asked the court to take ''emergency steps'' to protect him, but gave no indication of whether it would seek to do so. **********A pro-Ocalan group called the Kurdish Parliament in Exile urged Western nations to create an international court to try him, rather than letting Turkey do so. At a news conference in Brussels, a leader of the group, Zuber Aydar, also called for ''an international conference, including Kurdish representatives, to discuss the Kurdish question.''"

In 1992, as chief executive of Pacific Telesis Group, then the regional Bell company of California, Mr. Ginn decided to spin off the company's cellular phone operations into a separate company, Airtouch. And when the spinoff occurred in 1994, Mr. Ginn surprised many people by vacating his wood-paneled corner office at giant Pacific Telesis to run the smaller Airtouch. **********But last week's windfall also calls to mind the controversy that surrounded the Airtouch spinoff. **********Critics, led by consumer groups in California, contended that Mr. Ginn and other top managers at Pacific Telesis, far from gambling, were walking off with the fastest-growing and most glamorous part of the California phone company, enriching themselves in the process. Pacific Telesis, they said, was left a weaker company, resulting in higher telephone rates for consumers and the company's acquisition two years later by SBC Communications. **********What especially irks some consumer advocates now is that Mr. Ginn argued at the time that the wireless business needed to be divorced from the regulated phone company, and he vowed that Airtouch would never return to the haven of a regional Bell. Yet until Vodafone came along, Mr. Ginn had been negotiating to sell Airtouch to Bell Atlantic. **********''I would think it strange that Airtouch wants to be freed from the onerous position of being run by Pacific Telesis only to go under Bell Atlantic,'' Regina Costa, telecommunications research director for the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group, said a few days ago. She called the 1994 spinoff ''highway robbery -- and Ginn orchestrated it.'' **********Times have changed, Mr. Ginn said, and regulations have loosened. **********''I don't think Ma Bell lives at Bell Atlantic,'' he said in a telephone interview on Saturday. Now, he said, the need is for the size and financial resources to take advantage of ''an Alexander Graham Bell opportunity'' in wireless telecommunications. **********A Bell Atlantic merger would have created a nationwide giant, but the merger with Vodafone, the largest wireless provider in Europe, creates a global one, he said. **********''The wireless platform is going to win over time,'' Mr. Ginn said, predicting that 50 percent of households in developed nations will have wireless phones in a few years. **********But just as he took a smaller job when he left Pacific Telesis for Airtouch, Mr. Ginn will again see his job shrink so that his wireless company can grow. Chris Gent, the head of Vodafone, will be chief executive of Vodafone Airtouch. Mr. Ginn, who is 61, will be chairman but will not have day-to-day responsibilities. **********He can afford a leisurely retirement. According to last April's proxy, he owns 1.55 million Airtouch shares, worth $150 million at the $97-a-share price of Vodafone's offer. Mr. Ginn also had 1.75 million unexercisable options, which would be worth another $170 million and would become immediately exercisable upon the takeover. **********''I've made out extremely well, but our employees have made out extremely well also,'' Mr. Ginn said. **********All 12,500 Airtouch employees were given or bought stock, and their total gains from stock and options come to more than $2 billion, he said. Shareholders have also done well, with Airtouch shares having more than tripled from their initial price of $23, even before the run-up spurred by the acquisition talks. **********His many defenders say that Mr. Ginn is being rewarded for seeing the potential of wireless phones at a time others did not and for building Airtouch into the world's largest multinational wireless company. **********''He bet his career on it, he bet his business on it, and he was right,'' said George F. Schmitt, a former Airtouch executive who is now president of Omnipoint Communications, a wireless service provider. **********The son of a tire-shop manager from Alabama, Mr. Ginn got into telecommunications by accident. In his freshman year at Auburn University, he went to sign up with the Reserve Officers Training Corps and got in the shortest line. It turned out to be for the Signal Corps. **********With a degree in industrial management, he joined the AT&T Corporation as a management trainee in 1960. After a detour at Stanford Business School, he rose to become a vice president in AT&T's long-distance business. **********In 1978, Mr. Ginn was dispatched to Pacific Telephone, where he would  develop one of the nation's first cellular-phone systems, in time for the 1984 Summer Olympics. **********Philip Quigley, who worked under Mr. Ginn and eventually succeeded him as chief executive of Pacific Telesis, remembers sitting in the stands at the Olympics with Mr. Ginn, showing two Japanese executives a $3,000 Motorola cellular phone, which they used to call Japan. **********''We said, 'This is going to revolutionize the world,' '' Mr. Quigley, now a venture capitalist, recalled. ''We knew it was going to be big.'' **********When Pacific Telephone split from AT&T in the 1984 divestiture, Mr. Ginn became the head of the unregulated businesses of the newly named Pacific Telesis, including cellular phones. He showed an entrepreneurial flair rare in the Bell system and gave his managers profit-and-loss responsibilities. Some ventures flopped, but Mr. Ginn did well enough to become chief executive of Pacific Telesis in 1988. **********He expanded the cellular telephone operations aggressively, not only in the United States but overseas. In its biggest coup, Pacific Telesis, in partnership with Mannessmann A.G., won a license to provide cellular service in Germany in 1989, at a time when auctions were not held for licenses. ''It was an absolutely incredible moneymaker right away and we didn't pay a nickel for a license,'' Mr. Quigley said. **********But the investment needed to build wireless networks was diluting Pacific Telesis earnings and hurting its stock price. So in 1992, Mr. Ginn proposed spinning off the cellular operations. Consumer groups complained that Airtouch would inherit, free of charge, valuable cellular licenses in California that had been granted to Pacific Telesis because it was the regulated phone monopoly. **********Pacific Telesis also absorbed the debt incurred by the cellular operations, allowing Airtouch to start free of debt. Consumer groups called for ratepayers to be reimbursed $1 billion, but the state utility commission ordered a reimbursement of just $41 million. **********Mr. Ginn said Saturday that the cellular operations were paid for by Pacific Telesis shareholders, not ratepayers. As for breaking up Pacific Telesis, he said, ''If I could have solved it another way, I would have.''"

The index is up an astonishing 46.9 percent this year; in 10 of the last 11 trading days, it has closed at record highs. **********Of the fuels propelling this rocket in recent weeks, none has been more potent than the semiconductor sector. Shares of companies that make chips for the world's computers and other electronic gear have surged on rising sales and higher chip prices. **********As a result, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index of 16 companies is up 18 percent since Nov. 1. For the year, it is up 87 percent. **********Hot does not begin to describe these stocks. Applied Materials, a semiconductor equipment maker, had sales in the past 12 months of roughly $4 billion. Its market value is 10 times that figure. The Altera Corporation, a maker of integrated circuits, is trading at approximately 16 times its $772 million in sales over the past 12 months. **********To put this run-up in perspective, during other booms for semiconductor makers, the stocks rarely traded higher than two times their sales. **********What strikes some as peculiar about the current stampede into semiconductor shares is that worldwide sales of chips are expected to rise just 14 percent this year over last. Moreover, a multitude of computer manufacturers and resellers -- I.B.M. and Inacom, to name one of each -- have recently warned that the outlook for their businesses in the fourth quarter and beyond looks worrisome. Why are investors paying as much as 90 times earnings for companies whose futures depend on orders from computer makers who are singing the blues? **********Those who study the semiconductor industry -- a very cyclical business -- say recent sales increases at many of these companies are a result of an extraordinary inventory buildup by computer makers in recent months. These companies placed unusually heavy orders for chips on fears that an earthquake in Taiwan would cut supplies and in anticipation of strong computer sales to customers eager to buy before 2000. **********If computer demand does not soak up this inventory in the current quarter -- and I.B.M.'s warning of a slow fourth quarter lends credibility to that fear -- the world will be awash in chips. Prices will fall again and so will the stocks. **********Fred Hickey, editor of the High-Tech Strategist newsletter, thinks that sales of computers are starting a downward spiral that will extend into next year: ''We are going into a long period of decline in computer demand because buying has been accelerated in the past few years'' mostly by fears of Year 2000 computer problems. He forecasts a crash in semiconductor orders. **********Investors piling into semiconductor shares may not know that many insiders at these companies are exiting. Insider filings take time to trickle in, but the selling now looks like a consensus, according to Bob Gabele, director of insider research at First Call/Thomson Financial. **********From mid-August to late September, for example, seven insiders at Applied Materials have sold 308,247 shares; two sold more than half their holdings. The sales are the biggest in any 30-day period since 1997. **********At the Sanmina Corporation, a contract maker of circuit boards, five insiders sold almost 200,000 shares in August. One seller, a director, cut his position 94 percent. In his first sale since 1996, Eric Lidow, chairman of the International Rectifier Corporation, a maker of semiconductors for the power industry, sold 30 percent of his position. **********''This tells me the shares in the group are probably ahead of themselves here,'' Mr. Gabele said. ''The insiders all seem to think their shares have been bid up to unrealistic levels.''"

You Call It; Digital Sleight of Hand Can Put Ads Almost Anywhere,THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- Real or Virtual? You Call It; Digital Sleight of Hand Can Put Ads Almost Anywhere," **********A NEW form of advertising is rewriting an old saying to declare: Now you don't see it, now you do. **********The magic now, though, is supplied by computers, in the form of digital technology that inserts electronic images like signs, brand logos and even product packages into live and previously taped television programs. The computer-generated ads are sufficiently lifelike that viewers see them as real even though they are anything but. **********''Virtual advertising,'' as this trickery is known, is ''the Harry Houdini of the media business,'' said David Verklin, chief executive at Carat North America in New York, which buys commercial time and ad space for marketers. ''It's the most astonishing kind of advertising technology I've ever seen.'' **********Virtual advertising has so far been a novelty feature of live sports, where football players tackle each other in front of make-believe billboards and soccer players run across plausibly real trademarks. For example, the games of three Major League Baseball teams -- the San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies and San Diego Padres -- include virtual ads this season. **********But now virtual advertising is breaking through into entertainment, with programs being subtly changed to benefit advertisers. **********''You are seeing the first glimpse of the future of advertising,'' said Mr. Verklin of Carat, a unit of Aegis Group P.L.C., ''where the product and the program are integrated in a fashion that's more seamless than we ever could have imagined.'' **********Even though the big American networks are shunning the practice for now in entertainment programming, TV series in countries like Canada, Mexico and Spain are regularly augmented with virtual product placements; marketers are paying fees -- usually in the low four figures -- to have images of their goods and services inserted after production is completed. (With sports events, the ads are inserted live as the game or match is played.) **********Advocates of putting the ads in entertainment programs give several reasons for preferring that to simply placing products in a show before it is shot. For one thing, virtual products can be readily changed, so a different sponsor can be sold a placement each time a program runs. **********The placements can also be changed by geography: Viewers in the East might get a glimpse of Wise potato chips, while those in the West would see Laura Scudder's. And while agreements to place real products in programs can often take months or years to negotiate, the placement of virtual ads can be negotiated after the fact -- and theoretically far more quickly. **********In this country, what is believed to be the first use ever of virtual advertising outside sports came in March, when images for advertisers like Blockbuster, Coca-Cola, Evian and the fashion retailer Kenneth Cole were superimposed in an episode of ''Seven Days,'' a prime-time series on the UPN network. **********Those virtual products -- inserted at no cost to the sponsors as part of an experiment -- were indistinguishable from other background objects. In one scene, shopping bags bearing the Cole logo were placed in a hotel lobby. In another, bottles of Evian were added next to a water carafe and glasses. In a third, a videotape box bearing the Blockbuster logo was inserted onto a desk. **********''The fundamental appeal'' for advertisers ''is the idea that advertising in the show, in the game, is significantly more impactful than in the breaks,'' said Dennis Wilkinson, president and chief executive at Princeton Video Image Inc. in Lawrenceville, N.J., which handled the test for UPN and is a leader in video insertion services. **********''People pay more attention'' during a show than during a commercial, he added, making virtual advertising a powerful selling tool. **********Virtual ads are also capable of fighting commercial flight: the instant the sales spiels begin, ad-weary viewers leave the room or grab their remotes. **********''With the networks increasing their commercial loads,'' said Steve Saldano, partner and media services director at the Deutsch Inc. ad agency in New York, ''I'd like to have virtual advertising as a choice when I think, 'How else can I get my brand in front of the consumer?' '' **********''And if the digital future in some cases precludes commercials,'' he added, as wealthier viewers -- ''the most valuable consumers'' -- buy machines to delete them from programs, ''virtual advertising might work just fine in order to reach them.'' **********The expansion of virtual advertising is a sign of the never-ending efforts of marketers to blanket consumers in a continuous fog of sponsored pitches. Their goal is to elude consumer resistance to traditional forms of advertising like commercials and print advertisements. **********To that end, ads have intruded onto the floors of stores and the sides of blimps, airport baggage carousels and school hallways, coffee cups and stadium names, bathroom walls and hot dog cart umbrellas. So it seems inevitable that someday Madison Avenue will introduce its own version of a Zen koan and interpolate ads where there isn't anything at all. **********Virtual advertising ''is one of the first little gremlins to come out of the box of digitalization,'' said Alec Gerster, chairman at Mediacom in New York, the media buying unit of Grey Advertising. ''It just begins to highlight that a lot of people in the future will be able to touch content -- and change it.'' **********''Remember the outrage years ago when people altered black-and-white movies by colorizing them?'' Mr. Gerster asked. ''This makes colorization a mere drop in the bucket.'' **********Indeed, critics of the increasing encroachment of commercial elements are responding with outrage. **********''This is just one way television is up to its neck in commercialism, and it's getting worse by the day,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of Commercial Alert, an organization in Washington founded last year by the consumer advocate Ralph Nader. **********''People are being bombarded with ever-craftier ways of getting them to desire products,'' he said. ''It's another good reason they ought to be giving up their TV sets.'' **********Virtual advertising is by no means the first digital manipulation done for commercial purposes. Many TV spots already feature dogs that ''talk'' and babies who ''sing.'' In one hair-raising stunt, a new commercial for Mercedes-Benz by Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of Omnicom Group, brings Telly Savalas back as a hirsute Kojak. **********''As more and more media become digital, people are more aware reality is being tampered with,'' said Ellen Oppenheim, media director at the New York office of FCB Worldwide, an ad agency owned by True North Communications. **********''And people who have grown up with digital editing in movies are less bothered than a generation who might complain, 'Hey, they're messing with my reality,' '' she added. **********Besides, computers are constantly being used to change images in print advertising. For example, the trade publication Advertising Age reported this week about the doctoring of a photograph of the volleyball player Gabrielle Reece for an ad by Young & Rubicam Advertising in New York. The ad is part of a campaign that cheekily links athletic prowess to childhood consumption of Dannon yogurt, so a carton of the product is inserted into the photo, which shows Ms. Reece at age 6. **********But because of the dominant role television plays in American marketing, the growing presence of virtual ads -- in new shows and even in reruns of old ones -- is focusing fresh attention on the process. **********''It works best in sports,'' said Paul Schulman, president at Schulman/Advanswers NY, a unit of Omnicom in New York that buys commercial time for advertisers. ''In entertainment programs, I believe advertisers may be getting a little too excited about it. **********''I'm not sure the impression of having a product in a scene,'' he added, ''is as strong as the impression made with a solid 30-second commercial in a program with high attention levels.'' **********Needless to say, Mr. Wilkinson at Princeton Video Image disagrees. **********While ''it's clearly fair to say the sports applications have caught on faster than the entertainment applications,'' he said, ''the opportunity to place advertisements where without a doubt they have to be noticed'' means that it is only a matter of time before virtual advertising becomes widespread in first-run and syndicated series. **********''As long as it's done in good taste, as if it's part of the program and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb,'' he added, ''people will accept it, embrace it, because it will pay for the shows.'' **********Virtual ads, however, face some real obstacles, particularly in entertainment programming. One is the vexatious issue of rights, particularly how to reimburse the creators and producers of series if their work is changed. Even though virtual ads represent a new source of revenue for the Hollywood studios that produce TV programming, many describe the rights issue as a drawback that will impede the widespread appearance of virtual ads. **********Another obstacle is the difficulty in determining if and when a virtual ad is appropriate. **********''If Drew Carey were shown wearing designer clothes,'' said Ms. Oppenheim, referring to the comedian whose persona as a regular guy forms the basis for his ABC sitcom, ''there might be a credibility gap.'' **********And if virtual products were placed in, say, ''I Love Lucy,'' would they need to be in black and white because the series is? And would the products need to look the way they did in the 1950's to prevent viewers from being puzzled? **********As a result, several networks have decided against accepting virtual ads for entertainment programs, including ABC, CBS and NBC. At UPN -- the network jointly owned by Chris-Craft Industries and Viacom Inc., which tested virtual product placements in ''Seven Days'' -- ''it's still under review,'' said Paul McGuire, a spokesman. ''There aren't any plans at the moment to do it on another show.'' **********So where might the entertainment breakthrough occur? Perhaps a network will become more open-minded about considering it. **********At the Fox Broadcasting Company, owned by the News Corporation, Jeff De Rome, a spokesman, said that ''at the moment it's not allowed, because we're purists.'' **********''But we do not rule out all future applications,'' he added. ''We're not Luddites.'' **********And Steven Reddicliffe, editor in chief at TV Guide magazine in New York, owned by TV Guide Inc., said: ''People may find it objectionable in a situation comedy or an hourlong drama. But maybe not in a concert, a special, an awards show, if it's subtle and consistent with the content.'' **********''There's a good chance it will come,'' he added, ''and faster than we imagine.'' **********In the end, changing the look of TV may simply come down to changing attitudes among consumers as they become more accepting of -- though still skeptical about -- the commercialization of content. **********''If you say to the viewer, 'This detracts from the integrity of advertising,' '' said Ms. Oppenheim at FCB, ''the viewer is going to say 'Excuse me, there's integrity in advertising?' ''"

Mr. Tinelli is on the air five nights a week, cracking jokes, interviewing guests -- and, in recent months, sipping Budweiser from a can in front of millions of viewers. **********Thanks in part to the magic of product placement, Budweiser's sales in Argentina soared 61 percent in the first quarter of the year. **********Argentina is just one of many overseas markets -- the others include Britain, China, Ireland and Japan -- where the Anheuser-Busch Companies is pouring it on with its flagship brand. Through aggressive marketing to a young, upscale and better-educated slice of the world's population -- the same people who drink imports, as it happens, back in St. Louis, where Anheuser is based -- the company is hoping to turn Budweiser into a truly global brand, something no other beer has ever pulled off. **********Anheuser is intensifying its marketing abroad at a time of great strength at home. After a long and nasty price war with its closest rival, the Miller Brewing Company unit of the Philip Morris Companies, Anheuser has remained the leader in the United States, with a 45 percent market share, slightly more than it had five years ago. **********Volume has risen slightly in recent months, and the company has used the promise of extra marketing funds to entice many distributors to deal exclusively in its products. **********Having conquered the American market, Anheuser is now hoping to follow in the footsteps of the Coca-Cola Company and the Gillette Company, and burnish its stock, which has been something of a sleeper lately, through overseas expansion. **********For all the risks of such a global strategy, from the potential for economic turbulence in emerging markets to publicity nightmares like Belgium's ban on Coke last week, analysts say it is about time. While Coke, the undisputed worldwide king of cola, was selling one million cases of its products a year in Shanghai back in 1926, Anheuser did not even form an international division until 1982. ''They were so late to this game, it was just unbelievable,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. **********Getting a late start is the least of the company's problems. Selling American beer to finicky foreigners is tough going. After all, most of the world acknowledges America as the land of the soft drink and the home of the technologically advanced razor blade. But outside of the United States, beer lovers tend to be fiercely loyal to local brands, many of which date back hundreds of years, and scorn American beer as boredom in a bottle. **********Even the master brewers of Europe have a hard sell when they stray too far from home. For example, about 62 percent of the beer made by Heineken, the Dutch brewer, and 70 percent of the volume produced by Carlsberg A.S. of Denmark is sold in the European Union, according to Frank Walters, the director of research at Impact, a trade newsletter in New York. If it is tough for them, people in the industry say, it will be doubly hard for Anheuser. **********''They are a small international force now, and they will work very hard to become a major force,'' said Dan Tearno, a spokesman for Heineken USA. ''But I would say they have their work cut out for them.'' **********Along with the task of building the brand abroad, there is the sticky matter of a decades-old trademark dispute that prevents Anheuser from using the name Budweiser in many European countries. Budweiser Budvar, a Czech brewery, claims rights to the name stretching back to medieval times and has vigorously challenged Anheuser's use of it, with several lawsuits pending in countries like France and the Netherlands, where Anheuser's beer is labeled ''Bud.'' **********Anheuser ''would try to persuade the world (and perhaps themselves as well) that Budweiser is a fantasy trademark which does not have its roots in Budejovice but is exclusively connected with America,'' a note on the Budweiser Budvar Web site, www.budweiser.cz, says. Ceske Budejovice, the town where Budweiser Budvar is brewed, is Budweis in German. **********Anheuser is playing hardball in return. ''Periodically, some of their beer has leaked in here,'' Steven J. Burrows, the chief executive of Anheuser International, said of the other Budweiser, ''and as soon as we know about here or anywhere else where we have clear rights to the name, we go right after it.'' **********Mr. Burrows said the disputes were confined to Europe and had little effect on Anheuser's overseas sales. ''In some markets, we coexist,'' he said. ''In some markets, we have gained the right to use 'Budweiser'.'' In one market -- the Czech Republic -- Anheuser's beer is banned outright. **********Anheuser has tried to acquire a minority stake in Budweiser Budvar on several occasions, most recently in 1992, provoking further animosity. **********Anheuser's recent stepped-up effort abroad may have been inspired by the dimensions of imported beer's growth in the United States. Imports accounted for 8 percent of the United States market of 193 million barrels last year, up from 5.5 percent five years ago on similar consumption, and surged by 21 percent in the first quarter of this year even as overall beer consumption barely increased, Mr. Walters said. **********But although beer is not Coke, Anheuser has been able to borrow certain pages from the Coca-Cola playbook. It is concentrating its efforts around its flagship, Budweiser, and playing up its product's American cachet. It is also adapting its packaging to the demands of international markets, introducing one-liter bottles in Argentina and China, for example, in addition to the 12-ounce single-serving cans and bottles that are more popular in the United States. And in another echo of Coke strategy, Anheuser says it understands the need to make large investments of money and patience overseas before sales take off. **********Unlike Coke, though, Anheuser is new to the global way of thinking. ''It's taken Anheuser some time to genuinely admit that people make beer outside of St. Louis,'' said Ms. Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney. ''There's always been this idea that beer is such a regional business that American beer is for American customers.'' **********That mentality is changing. Anheuser knows that the United States, where the beer-chugging population of men in their 20's will increase over the next few years, remains its core market. Still, Mr. Burrows said, ''the opportunity for long-term growth and increasing shareholder value will come from expanding our business beyond the U.S.'' **********Recently, that expansion has slowed. After shooting up more than 13 percent in both 1996 and 1997, the company's total overseas beer sales rose just six-tenths of 1 percent last year, largely as a result of the recession in Japan, according to the company's annual report. And overseas sales reached just 7.1 million barrels last year, around 7 percent of the total, with profits around 6.7 percent of Anheuser's total beer profits. **********Foreign expansion is a costly exercise. Like Coca-Cola, Anheuser believes that a key to winning converts is making a product that tastes exactly the same everywhere in the world. So it sends brewmasters to its overseas plants to supervise the making of Budweiser from ingredients that are mostly imported from the United States. ''If you don't have a consistent product, you can't build up brand loyalty,'' Mr. Walters said. **********Anheuser was forced to modify its strategy in Japan last year. In the last three years, as the country's economy has been mired in recession, a cheaper beer type known as happoshu has emerged, supported by a reduced Government tax on such beer, which is less than 25 percent malt, Mr. Burrows said. **********Anheuser sat out the first round, watching as Suntory Ltd. cornered the market for products priced about 30 percent below the 200 yen, or $1.75, that most premium beers are sold for. When Suntory's share went from zero to 18 percent in the category, Anheuser had a change of heart and began marketing its own brand of lower-malt beer, called Buddy's. **********''We thought it was important to compete,'' Mr. Burrows said. Earlier this year, Anheuser also introduced a beer called Budweiser Fine Malt, intended for the older consumer, with a flavor that Mr. Burrows described as ''slightly more bitter, fuller, darker, consistent with a Japanese beer profile.'' In other words, not a lager. Anheuser reported selling about 500,000 barrels of beer in Japan last year. **********China has become Anheuser's fifth-largest overseas market since Budweiser was introduced there in 1993. Sold largely in hotels, discos and restaurants in coastal cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou, Bud is known locally as Baiwei, which Mr. Burrows translates as ''100 magnificents.'' **********Even so, China has been a complex frontier. Budweiser is priced two to three times higher than local premium beers, and distribution is a piecemeal arrangement. A price war among international beer makers in China during the last half of 1998 cut into sales because Anheuser did not lower its prices and volume declined, Mr. Burrows said. A lower-priced beer is being sold this year in test markets there, also under the Buddy's brand. **********The largest foreign market for Budweiser is Canada, where 1.7 million barrels, brewed under arrangement with the Labatt Brewing Company unit of Interbrew of Belgium, were sold last year. It has also been successful in Ireland, where a 1986 distribution arrangement with Guinness, a Diageo P.L.C. subsidiary, has made Budweiser one of the top three beers. (Guinness, meanwhile, is still No. 1, followed by Budweiser or Heineken, depending on who is counting.) **********Anheuser is aiming at younger people overseas because they are more likely to experiment with new brands. To lure them in Japan, for example, the company peddles Budweiser clothing and other products on the Web, and hands out free samples in bars. **********Anheuser has been able to export many of its other tried-and-true marketing devices as well. The famed frogs appear in commercials in Ireland, England and on ESPN broadcasts around the world. The ''Budweiser girls,'' spandex-clad representatives at various company-sponsored events, have their overseas incarnations as well. In China, generally a more conservative place socially, the women often turn up at bars dressed in skirts, vests and tennis shoes, Mr. Burrows said, although miniskirts are not unheard of.  ''It's whatever people in the market are most comfortable with,'' he said. **********In Argentina, per capita beer consumption has risen to 9.275 gallons a year from 7.95 over the last 15 years, while wine consumption has declined. Budweiser signs have cropped up on venerable restaurant facades across Buenos Aires, including that of Los Inmortales, a shrine to tango, which now has four big red-and-white Bud signs. A major factor in Budweiser's advance has been the partnership with Compania Cervecerias Unidas, an established distributor that had long wanted to increase its sales in Argentina and was willing to compete against Quilmes, the most popular local beer, although Budweiser is priced higher. **********Anheuser has also tried to affiliate its brand closely with popular sports events. Budweiser is the exclusive beer sponsor for the Copa America soccer competition in South America, for example. It also sponsors horse races in Ireland and American football matches in England. **********As it tries to drive Budweiser sales overseas, Anheuser has made equity investments in other beer makers, notably Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V., which makes Corona, the top-selling import in the United States. Anheuser holds a $1.6 billion, 50.2 percent stake in Modelo, profiting every time a Corona is sold even though it does not own the brand. And the company has an 8 percent stake in C.C.U. Argentina, its Argentine distributor, which, if one takes the long view, may carry Anheuser beyond Argentina. ''Argentina is next to Brazil,'' Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch, pointed out, ''and on a long-term basis, Brazil is very much in Anheuser's plans.''"

Those ads, shot by the fashion photographer Bruce Weber, have stimulated significant revenue gains as well as heated debate over whether they show too much of the comely models and not enough of the A.& F. brand of shirts, shorts and swimwear. **********Now the playful sexual attitude that infuses the print campaign -- popular enough to generate sales of about 220,000 copies of each quarterly issue of the magalogue -- is coming to life in commercials that will run on cable television and on monitors in Abercrombie & Fitch stores nationwide. The theme of the spots, scheduled to begin Sept. 4, is college wrestling or, as it is described in so-called teaser ads appearing in Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone magazines, ''what men do during boys' basketball season.'' **********Using sex as a weapon in mainstream marketing dates to when Lillian Nordica, the turn-of-the-century opera singer, posed for Coca-Cola ads. Still, the Abercrombie & Fitch campaign, which is created by Shahid & Company in New York in collaboration with Mr. Weber, is notable for its continuous baring of buff bodies -- mostly male -- with a devil-may-care style and tongue-in-cheek tone. **********The executives responsible for the print campaign and its leap into television, where the theme will be ''When you're young, you're golden,'' take issue with suggestions that the commercials may be deemed salacious by the growing ranks of critics who complain that television is increasingly exploiting sex. **********''Why would we worry about that?'' asked Sam Shahid, president and creative director at Shahid. ''It's not that kind of commercial.'' **********''It's real wrestling, kids in school,'' he added. ''This is about brotherhood, training to be part of a team, building character, helping one another.'' **********As for complaints that the campaign objectifies young men as beefcake in the same manner that advertising has long objectified young women as cheesecake, Mr. Shahid said: ''Fine. Let them complain. The kids love it; it's for them. **********''I say to everyone, it's for everybody,'' Mr. Shahid continued. ''They all want to be a part of it. Gays love it; straights love it; girls love it. Gay friends tell me, 'That guy is incredible.' Girls write, 'Where do you meet these guys?' It's in the eye of the beholder.'' **********The wrestling theme of the commercials echoes the themes of the magalogues, which are focused on collegiate matters like a semester abroad (the subject of the back-to-school issue, now out), spring break or summer vacation. **********''We're a life-style brand, projecting inside the store and outside the store the life style of a very specific target customer, the 18-to-22-year-old American college student,'' said Michael S. Jeffries, chairman and chief executive at Abercrombie & Fitch in Reynoldsburg, Ohio. **********As for the undressed models, as typified by magalogue pages showing streakers, ''that's part of college life,'' he said. **********''It's fun; every college has a Naked Day,'' he added. **********Though A.& F. concentrates on college-age consumers, Mr. Jeffries said, ''some of our customers are younger'' because they want to emulate their older siblings. As a result, a children's division with stores called Abercrombie is being developed; there are 14 now with plans to open 20 more in the fall. **********The magalogues and related catalogues, distributed free to 800,000 to one million customers each quarter, will remain devoted to the core college-age consumer, he added, because of the nature of their contents. **********And some customers of A.& F. are older, Mr. Jeffries said, ''because we live in a society where everyone aspires to be young'' -- and besides, ''college was a very wonderful time of life for most people.'' **********There are about 190 Abercrombie & Fitch stores, with an additional 30 or so planned to open in the fall. Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 1999, which ended April 30, totaled $188 million, up 40.3 percent from $134 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. Second-quarter results are to be reported Tuesday. **********The planning of the budget for the commercials and the decisions on which cable networks will run them are not finished, Mr. Shahid said. Print ads to promote the magalogues, which run in Interview and Out magazines in addition to Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair, have an estimated annual budget of $2 million; Abercrombie & Fitch does not discuss the costs of producing the magalogues and catalogues. **********What's next for the campaign after print and TV? A real surprise, Mr. Shahid hinted: ''Radio will come, too. That would be so great.'' **********It's not unlike the riddle asking about the sound of one hand clapping. What does a college student tugging off his boxers sound like?"

It said in a statement that ''the offer undervalues Natwest Group, is unsolicited, unwelcome and ill-thought-out.'' **********Natwest officials had no comment today on word that a larger offer from the Royal Bank might be imminent. Officials at The Royal Bank of Scotland could not be reached for comment. **********Natwest, which had been in the midst of a proposed $17.2 billion acquisition of the Legal and General Group, a big British insurer, has temporarily postponed a vote on that deal, which had been scheduled for Oct. 6. The Bank of Scotland's offer was contingent on Natwest's abandoning that acquisition. The Royal Bank is said to be considering imposing a similar condition. **********On Friday, investors and analysts had anticipated that other suitors might emerge, sending shares of Natwest up 29 percent, to 13.54 [pounds]. At the time, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Abbey National P.L.C. and Halifax P.L.C. were the names being mentioned in financial circles here as possible new bidders for Natwest, which is larger than any of them -- as well as being twice the size of the Bank of Scotland. **********These banks are assumed to be on a short list of banking companies that regulators might allow to acquire Natwest. Other big banks, like HSBC Holdings P.L.C., along with Barclays and Lloyds TSB, would most likely be deemed too big to be allowed to acquire Natwest, which is Britain's third-largest bank, with $235.9 billion in assets. **********Although some analysts said that Abbey National and Halifax were probably too small to acquire Natwest, a British Sunday paper, The Observer, reported today that Abbey National was preparing its own bid for Natwest. Abbey National officials could not be reached for comment. **********A Natwest takeover by either the Bank of Scotland, which has $95.7 billion in assets, or the Royal Bank, with assets of more than $134 billion, would create Britain's second-largest banking company. **********Executives close to the deal said that the Royal Bank of Scotland had retained Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs to draw up a plan for a counteroffer. The Bank of Scotland is being represented by Gleacher & Company, which Natwest had owned for three years before selling it back in April to Eric Gleacher and its other principals. It is also being advised by Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Natwest has hired J. P. Morgan and Dresdner Bank. **********The emergence of the two Scottish banks as rival bidders is somewhat novel. Earlier this month, executives from the two companies had discussed the possibility of making a joint bid for Natwest, according to people close to the discussions. The Sunday Telegraph reported that the talks broke down because both banks would have had to divest too many assets to placate regulators. A spokesman at the Bank of Scotland declined to comment on the report. **********Analysts predicted that a showdown between the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland would be just the beginning of consolidation in British banking, after the spate of mergers and acquisitions among banks on the Continent in recent months. **********''The pressure for consolidation has been building up for some time,'' said John Tyce, an analyst with SG Securities in London. **********Of the Bank of Scotland's attempt to acquire Natwest, even with a hostile bid, he said, ''They definitely are pushing on an open door.'' **********Natwest itself may have created that opening with its plan to buy the insurer Legal and General in an effort to expand its position in financial services while remaining independent. Analysts and investors have bitterly complained that Natwest was paying too much for the company. Its stock tumbled 9 percent in three days after it said on Sept. 5 that it would pay 2.10 [pounds] a share for Legal and General, a 20 percent premium over the stock's price the day before Natwest made its announcement. **********The Bank of Scotland and now the Royal Bank of Scotland are hoping to take advantage of unhappiness among Natwest stockholders by offering an alternative strategy. **********''It's very opportunistic,'' Mr. Tyce said. **********In addition to forcing Natwest to abandon its acquisition of Legal and General as a condition of its own acquisition, the Bank of Scotland said it planned to sell or spin off noncore assets and reduce Natwest's work force of 64,400. The Royal Bank of Scotland is also planning cuts, executives close to the deal said. **********Whether Natwest would be more receptive to a higher bid by the Royal Bank is uncertain. But in rejecting the Bank of Scotland's offer, Natwest had criticized not only the price but also the plan to reduce the staff and sell assets. **********''Natwest has a vision of growth in financial services,'' Natwest's chairman, Sir David Rowland, said in a statement released on Friday, ''with an expanding range of products to develop across its 6.5 million customer base and its position as the U.K.'s leading business bank. This should be contrasted with Bank of Scotland's plans for asset sales, branch closures and footprint reductions.''"

But it reversed its early climb and ended the session lower. **********Broader market averages were mixed. **********The Dow, made up of 30 of the best-known names in corporate America, poked through 10,000 at 9:50 A.M., soon after trading began on the New York Stock Exchange, and rose as high as 10,001.78. **********But the index pulled back and closed at 9,930.47, down 28.30 points, or nearly three-tenths of 1 percent, on the day. **********While 10,000 is an eye-popping number, analysts noted that in percentage terms the rise from 9,000 was less significant than any of the other 1,000-point gains the average has recorded during its long bull run, which began in 1982. **********''While people are transfixed with the prospect of all those zeros, what is most impressive is not the level itself but the length of this bull market,'' said Christine A. Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. **********The rise in the Dow, she said, ''represents a complete shift from inflation-hedge assets like houses and gold mines to assets that thrive only when inflation is under control and Government fiscal policy is being reined in.'' **********''Once those goals have been achieved,'' she added, ''the equity gains tend to be smaller.'' **********Indeed, market technicians and portfolio strategists have been concerned for some time that the rise in the Dow and other market gauges has been led by a relative handful of stocks. That narrowness, they contend, is a warning sign for the future. **********''The lack of breadth in the market worries me to death,'' said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed, an investment firm in Overland Park, Kan., which manages more than $27 billion. ''The market's internal technical factors just don't look good.'' **********Yesterday's action fed this sort of concern. On both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, declining issues outnumbered those that advanced. **********For the most part, stock traders tended to ignore a good day in the bond market as interest rates fell. **********Well-known technology shares did better for a second consecutive session. But bank stocks, which rallied on Monday, fell back yesterday. **********Trading volume on the Big Board was relatively modest, just shy of 752 million shares. On the Nasdaq market, 977.2 million shares changed hands. **********The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which set a closing high on Monday, slipped 0.90 point, to 1,306.36. The Nasdaq, which has risen more than 11 percent this year, gained 7.83 points, to 2,439.27. **********But the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company shares, a laggard for nearly a year, fell 1.67 points, or four-tenths of a percent, to 399.17. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.60 points, to 716.31. **********''We are fully invested in small and mid-cap stocks and are beating ourselves in the head every day,'' Mr. Herrmann said. **********Two financial stocks, those of American Express and J. P. Morgan, were the biggest drags on the Dow. American Express, which has been among the market's best performers so far this year, fell 2 3/16  a share, to 123 9/16 . Morgan dropped 1 3/8, to 124. **********Merck & Company, the drug giant, was the best-performing Dow stock; the company's shares rose 1 5/8, to 85 7/8, after the company received Government approval for expanded use of an anti-cholesterol drug. **********Among big technology stocks, Intel gained 2 1/2 a share, to 120 3/8. A report released late Monday showed that semiconductor sales rose 1.2 percent in January, to $11.1 billion, compared with $10.97 billion in the month a year earlier as rising demand in Europe and much of Asia offset lower sales in North and South America. Microsoft rose 3 3/16 , to 169 1/16 . And Cisco Systems gained 1, to 106. **********Flashnet Communications, an Internet service provider, more than doubled in its first day of trading, closing at 43 5/8, after coming to market priced at 17. **********With the exception of Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M., technology stocks are absent from the Dow. But some market strategists said that recent weakness in technology issues boded well for stocks. **********''Technology stock prices peaked on Feb. 1,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''But even though technology has been in the penalty box, the market has been able to hit new highs. Bond yields are stabilizing because of no apparent signs of inflation, and now earnings are beginning a cyclical recovery. The bull market is back in business.'' **********Mr. Galvin, clearly optimistic about the market's prospects, projects the Dow will not flirt with the 10,000 level for long. By the end of the year, he expects the average to be at 11,000."

Investors were dumping shares, complaining that the company had lost its way. It had missed a critical beat a few years earlier, betting on analog products when the world began craving all things digital. **********The company took a charge against earnings of $1.9 billion a year ago, but today it is on the rebound. Shares that were selling for $38 last October are going for nearly $100 -- a $30 billion leap in market value. **********The reason: a revamping that trimmed the work force and refocused the company's marketing of cellular telephones and semiconductors. In addition, demand has begun to revive in the critical Asia market, which slumped in 1998. **********Today, Motorola handily beat Wall Street projections by reporting earnings of $273 million, or 44 cents a share, for the second quarter of the year, up from $6 million, or 1 cent a share, a year ago. Analysts had estimated 41 cents a share. The announcement came after the close of trading. But ahead of the earnings release, shares of Motorola closed at $96.50, down $2.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Underlying Motorola's recent spate of good fortune is a less-well-known strategic shift, top executives say. The company plans to recast itself from a manufacturer of technology hardware to a software maker that is boldly vowing to bring the World Wide Web not only to cellular telephones and pagers but even to the automobile, which could soon be wired to download video games for backseat passengers. **********It is unclear whether Motorola's futuristic musings are just that, but the company has already invested billions of dollars and hired thousands of new software engineers. It also says it will equip every cellular telephone it makes next year with an Internet browser. **********''We are becoming much more of a software company,'' said Dennis A. Roberson, chief technology officer at Motorola. ''It's a very significant break for us. There are more software capabilities in the devices we produce, and we're expanding into the Internet space.'' **********None of these ambitions would be possible, of course, without a recovery in the sale of cellular telephones and microchips, which account for about 68 percent of revenue. This year, the company is finally selling substantial numbers of digital cellular telephones, allowing Motorola to compete against Nokia of Finland and Ericsson of Sweden. **********Still, executives at company headquarters here in Schaumburg, a suburb of Chicago, are cautious about using the word ''turnaround'' just yet, and for good reason. Motorola faces some huge problems, ranging from a billion-dollar investment in a tottering satellite venture called Iridium to the challenge of regaining market share in the increasingly competitive market for wireless products and infrastructure. **********Although it is now making and selling digital products, for example, Motorola still does not have a digital telephone able to supply the One Rate plan at AT&T Wireless, one of the nation's largest wireless service providers. Motorola executives say such multiple-system phones should be ready later this year. **********Christopher B. Galvin, the 49-year-old chief executive, talks about creating a ''new Motorola,'' a company in search of ''breakaway opportunities.'' Doing so means fostering double-digit growth at a giant with $30 billion in revenue and more than 130,000 employees. Motorola is emphasizing software ventures, in part, to make the company more flexible and less capital intensive. **********Wall Street analysts have been almost universally optimistic about Motorola in the last year. But several analysts said the company still had to prove it could execute its plans. **********''They have been a well-regarded stock lately,'' Kenneth Leon, a wireless communications analyst at ABN Amro, said of Motorola. ''But they have a growth rate in the low teens, and their competitors, like Lucent and Nokia, have growth rates in the 20's and 30's.'' **********Motorola says a corporate makeover is well under way. Some factories have been shuttered and their functions farmed out, and executives have been trying to do away with a ''warring tribes'' culture that pitted one division against another. **********Gone is the sense of invincibility that once pervaded the company, analysts say. **********''Motorola had an insular attitude,'' said Merle Gilmore, an executive vice president at the company. ''We need to change that view. Things are happening too fast. Customer demands are too exacting. Now you need to be part of an overall echo system.'' **********The company found itself outside that echo system in recent years and did not adequately foresee technological changes and market trends. **********Motorola stumbled when the wireless industry began to shift from analog to digital technology. In 1994, it practically owned the cellular market, with a 60 percent share in the United States. Nokia, which then  had only 11 percent of the United States market, is now the leader at about 34 percent, with Motorola second at about 31 percent, according to Herschel Shosteck Associates. Motorola executives saw the shift coming but did not expect it to come so swiftly, they now acknowledge. **********Motorola's problem was compounded by a rash of product delays, marketing miscues (Motorola's once trend-setting flip phones have recently been perceived as having lost their fashion edge) and repeated complaints that the company was using bully tactics with some of its customers. **********''They used to be very arrogant,'' said Phillip Redman, an analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston. ''They used to push phones on people and say, 'If you want our phones, you have to buy so many.' '' **********The company suffered huge losses in cellular handsets and infrastructure -- the bay stations and servers that make cellular calls possible. A $1.1 billion profit in 1997 became a loss of $1 billion in 1998. **********Motorola is trying to fix its cellular and chip divisions. In recent months, the company has sold off its low-end chip manufacturing business, laid off more than 17,000 employees and shifted more than 3,000 engineers to develop new digital handsets. **********''In handsets, Motorola is emerging as a winner again,'' said Matthew Hoffman, an analyst at Dataquest. ''And the pie is growing 30 to 40 percent a year. There could be 200 million handsets sold this year. And that's good for Motorola.'' **********The company faces a fierce competition in cellular infrastructure from Ericsson, Nortel and Lucent Technologies. All three rivals possess a ''switching technology'' -- the costly and critical component that is at the hub of all telephone service. Motorola is the only major supplier of cellular service without an end-to-end solution. **********''They have a big challenge ahead on the infrastructure side,'' said Jane Zweig, an telecommunications analyst at Herschel Shosteck. **********Motorola's executives say, however, that they are working on a solution: a complex packet-switching technology that would shuttle voice, data and video from the Internet to wireless devices. To get there, Motorola has announced ambitious joint ventures with Cisco Systems Inc., a leader in networking, and with Sun Microsystems Inc., best known for its Java programming language and its Solaris operating system. **********Motorola and its partners are by no means alone. Lucent (which bought Ascend Communications) and Nortel (which acquired Bay Networks) are also working to develop wireless Internet access and what they call the ''broadband living experience.'' But Motorola is betting that its approach will put it ahead of the pack, eliminating the need for circuit switching technology. **********The company is experimenting with microchips for everything from shoes, doorknobs, sofas and the family pet, chips that the company hopes will pervade an interactive society in which trillions of snippets of voice, data and video are beamed worldwide. **********Mr. Roberson, the chief technology officer at Motorola, foresees enormous opportunities as well as fun in the ''trillion device problem'' of linking everything up wirelessly. ''Embedded processors of the world unite,'' he said with a smile. **********Motorola chips already power cellular phones, digital cameras and 3Com Palm Pilots, television sets, printers and microwaves. But in the company's view of the future, Motorola chips will also be the ''digital DNA'' inside a new breed of ''smart'' products. **********Motorola does not just want to make the chips. It wants to design and develop the software that runs them, and to work with customers to create new products. **********The company is developing myriad devices, from flat-panel displays and set-top boxes to a wireless biotechnology product that might someday take an individual's blood sample and instantly transmit it to doctors, or even offer a diagnosis using a genomics data base. **********For the short term, Motorola is trying to broaden its revenue sources. The company has a strong business in two-way radios (sold to governments and large industry), consumer-oriented walkie-talkies, called Talk About, and ''smartcards,'' which can be used for security clearances, automated tellers, debit cards and other types of E-commerce. **********Its paging business is slumping, but Motorola is a leader in cable modems and chips supplied to networking companies like Cisco Systems. Motorola is also a leading supplier to the auto industry, selling global positioning satellite technology. A new division of the company is working on high-definition television  and interactive television. **********One of the more troublesome projects, however, is the Motorola-led consortium called Iridium, a big satellite communications network that has been on the brink of bankruptcy in recent months. The network of 66 satellites, which offers telephone service anywhere in the world, has had a difficult time signing up subscribers and making loan payments, some of which are guaranteed by Motorola. Analysts worry that Motorola could be hurt by a mounting debt load. **********''Iridium is an exposure, and no one is happy with it,'' said Wojtek Uzdelewicz, an analyst at S. G. Cowen. ''The biggest risk is that Iridium will stay afloat and Motorola will increase its financing, and then you'll have this sinkhole. The hope is that Motorola makes a decision very soon.'' **********Motorola is moving ahead with another satellite venture called Teledesic L.L.C., which would deliver voice, data and high-speed Internet access to hand-held devices. Other partners in the $9 billion effort include William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman; Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, and Boeing. Last week, Motorola won the contract to develop the satellites for a low-orbit system that is expected to be launched in 2004. **********Wall Street analysts say that if the satellite ventures work, Motorola's prospects will be enormous. Meantime, they are cheering Motorola's plan. **********''We like the story; we think the turnaround is for real,'' said Michael Ching, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. ''The challenge, of course, is execution. Now Motorola has to deliver the products on a timely basis.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/01/business/international-business-us-concern-solicits-british-investment-funds.html,Alan Cowell,1999-06-01,American retail investment broker Edward Jones opens first office in London; Edward Jones believes Britain is ripe for personal investment boom; firm stresses personal contact and free advice; photo (M),947,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,U.S. Concern Solicits British Investment Funds,INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; U.S. Concern Solicits British Investment Funds," **********On a sunny midday in Golders Green, Simon Benarroch is offering lox and champagne to celebrate the opening of the first office in London of Edward Jones, the American retail investment broker. **********Mr. Benarroch, a 25-year-old British newcomer at the conservative United States firm, might seem an unlikely emblem of an American invasion aiming at some of the billions in private investment to be unlocked as Britons look beyond the welfare state to embrace an American philosophy of financial self-reliance. **********But Mr. Benarroch figures he has history on his side **********''My generation knows that when you get to retirement, you'll have to look after yourself,'' Mr. Benarroch said, breaking briefly from shaking hands with potential customers in this wealthy area of north London. ''Older people think the state is going to look after them, but they haven't cottoned on yet.'' **********The calculation that Britain is ripe for a personal investment boom underpins this newest American sortie into Main Street Britain by a company that seeks a niche between high-priced financial advisers, low-cost discount brokers and banks. Increasingly, the argument runs, a wave of privatizations is introducing Britons to investment markets at precisely the time when state and corporate pension funds and other safety nets are shrinking. **********''We saw this shift towards the individual,'' said John Bachmann, the managing principal of Edward Jones, who visited his first London branch for the champagne-and-lox ceremony a few weeks ago.. ''Those of us who were in the U.S. markets in the 1960's come over here and see a market that we recognize. It's one that is set to boom over the next 10 years.'' **********In some ways, Edward Jones, based in St. Louis, is late into the game, opening its first provincial office in Norwich last year and now boasting 52 one-person British outlets, many in the traditional stockbroker belt around London. **********Charles Schwab, the largest United States discount broker, acquired Sharelink, a provincial British stockbroker, four years ago, climbing into a rough-and-tumble contest. Banks, discount share-dealing firms and even Richard Branson's Virgin company are all competing for investment and savings funds that Britons once kept locked away in low-yield bank deposits and accounts at savings and loan companies, many of which have now been turned into banks. **********Indeed, the mid-1990's transformation of savings and loan companies and the privatization of utilities made many Britons into shareholders for the first time, swelling the ranks of Britons who hold stock to more than 17 million. **********Even the mighty Merrill Lynch, strongly established in the City of London, has gone regional, opening offices last year in Edinburgh and Newcastle and eyeing similar expansion in Manchester and Leeds, according to Tim Taylor, its managing director of private banking in London. And while Merrill Lynch's global asset management offering caters to a more well-padded clientele with upwards of $250,000 to invest, some of the calculations about the future are similar to those of Edward Jones. **********''I do think it's true that future generations are going to find themselves making decisions about the allocation of long-term assets that were once made by state or corporate pension schemes,'' said Michael Morley, a Merrill Lynch private client specialist. **********The American invasion has added to the competitive pressures on Britain's own fractured investment fraternity, which is heavily concentrated in London, and which has traditionally carved up the market between high-ticket stockbrokers, independent financial advisers selling pensions and insurance and a range of fund managers. In recent years, some of Britain's best-known private client stockbrokers have been forced into mergers and that trend may well continue. ''We expect a lot more change, a lot more consolidation,'' said Mr. Taylor at Merrill Lynch. **********There is plenty at stake. More than 4 million Britons have financial assets -- pension funds, bank deposits and investments -- worth more than $80,000 and, of those, 1.4 million have assets of between $160,000 and $800,000, making Britain the world's fifth biggest personal financial services market, according to a Merrill Lynch study released last year and based on 1997 figures. By the end of 1997, this report said, Britain's private investors controlled assets -- including offshore investments -- of more than $1 trillion. **********The Edward Jones approach, of course, is distinctive in Britain, stressing a Main Street presence and local contacts made from a one-person office, where advice is free and revenues come from commission fees and transaction charges. **********Steve Jones, an American pioneer who opened an Edward Jones outlet in Sevenoaks last year, came from a similar operation in Wake Forest, N.C., and established himself in Britain, he said, by ''walking up and down the street'', seeking out the nameplates of accountants and solicitors for his client list. **********Mr. Benarroch's own operation on Finchley Road in Golders Green is sandwiched between Diva's Italian restaurant and Co Co's Fitness Center. But while Co Co's offers ''rapid inch loss'' and ''the ultimate relaxing experience,'' Mr. Benarroch is hooked up by satellite and computer to the markets and is set to offer ''buy-and-hold'' investments, primarily in British equities, for the long haul. ''Some people come in wanting to make a quick fortune and we say they are not the people for us,'' Mr. Benarroch said. **********If Britons resent the American approach, they are not saying so. ''As a woman, yes, it appeals to me because I feel comfortable coming into a place like this,'' said Susan Mindel, who runs a mail-order business in photographic supplies. Mr. Benarroch even won the endorsement of one representative of the British establishment, Lord Jeffrey Archer, who traveled to Golders Green to inaugurate the office and, thereby, press his campaign for London's mayoral elections next year. Pointedly, he noted that the American company said it was no fly-by-night. ''Those are the ones we like,'' he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/03/technology/beyond-neon-electronic-ink.html,Lisa Guernsey,1999-06-03,"Electronic ink can rearrange itself in response to electrical charges, allowing text to change at programmer's whim; founders of E Ink feel commercial messages on large signs are perfect test cases for new technology; signs are large enough to all...",1061,,The New York Times,Technology,News,article,Beyond Neon: Electronic Ink,Beyond Neon: Electronic Ink," **********GUTENBERG would turn over in his grave. Not at the notion of electronic ink, which can rearrange itself in response to electrical charges, allowing a page of text to change from ''Hamlet'' to ''Windows 98 for Dummies'' at a programmer's whim. No, he would turn over at some of the first words in the new ink to reach the public. **********They are now hanging on a sign in the sportswear department of a J. C. Penney store in Marlborough, Mass. They read: ''See your salesperson for the right fit.'' **********It's not exactly poetry. But for now, commercial messages on large signs are perfect test cases for the technology, according to the founders of E Ink, the company that created the J. C. Penney signs. The signs are large enough to allow the developers to experiment without having to tinker in tiny spaces with tiny materials. And a market for the technology already existed: store managers wanted light, flexible signs that could be programmed to flash catchy new messages without sucking up too much electricity. **********''What we're talking about right now is the beginning,'' said Paul Drzaic, director of display technology for E Ink, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. ''The end point is the newspaper or book.'' **********E Ink was founded by four men: Joseph Jacobson, a professor at the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; two of his students, Barrett Comiskey and J. D. Albert, and Russell J. Wilcox, a graduate of Harvard University's business school, who joined the others after writing his thesis on how to build a company around electronic-ink technology. Dr. Jacobson conducts research on electronic displays -- and much of his research forms the basis of E Ink's signs. **********Across the continent, Nicholas Sheridon, a researcher at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, has been experimenting with similar technology, creating what he calls electronic paper. Mr. Sheridon's research has not yet led to a commercial product, but he said in an interview that news about a deal with a manufacturing partner was just around the corner. **********Electronic ink and electronic paper use the same principle: ink reacts to an electric charge. A positive charge causes one color to appear. A negative charge causes a different color to appear. Letters are spelled and graphics are displayed by the pattern of those two colors. **********In E Ink's design, the ink is composed of white particles suspended in an oily blue dye inside clear microcapsules. The company's founders say the microcapsules look like clear beach balls on a tiny scale, full of liquid and containing several dozen white Ping-Pong-like balls. **********In the technology used for the signs, each microcapsule is 100 microns in diameter -- small enough to fit inside the period at the end of this sentence. Each particle within the microcapsule is one-tenth of a micron in diameter and carries a slightly negative charge. To the human eye, the ink looks like a smooth liquid. **********That ink is sandwiched between a base that is coated with graphite and has electrodes connected by tiny silver leads to computer chips, and a thin, transparent layer of indium tin oxide, which is the side turned toward the viewer. **********The computer chips provide the instructions to produce the negative or positive charges, depending on the ink patterns that are desired. Those computer chips receive instructions from a pager embedded within the sign, which receives its instructions from a handheld device or computer via wireless signals. **********When a section of the sign receives instructions for the base layer to become positively charged, for example, the tiny white particles inside the microcapsules are drawn to the base, producing dark areas or pixels in the sign. In other sections the white particles might be forced toward the transparent surface, creating light pixels that form the letters on the dark background. **********Only a short aplication of voltage is needed to rearrange the ink, so the signs use less power than video screens or computer monitors, which require a steady stream of electricity to display a message. **********At J. C. Penney, for example, store managers can sit down at computers and write which words they would like to see displayed, in white letters, on the E Ink sign. They can also program the signs to flip between several sentences at specific intervals. Then they simply beam their directions up to the sign via the wirelss link. **********''It's a powerful idea -- having computers automatically update the signs,'' said Mr. Comiskey, one of E Ink's founders. Instead of having to ask members of the sales staff to walk throughout the store putting up posters and taking them down, a manager can simply press a button and have the signs changed. Instructions can be sent to signs in other locations, too. E Ink signs will be going up in stores in Dallas and Chicago in the next few months. **********Electronic books, however, are not poised to become products quite so soon, Dr. Drzaic said. One of the barriers, he said, is the cost of creating patterns of electrodes on very small surface areas. ''As we go to higher and higher resolutions, we will need to use more precise means of patterning,'' Dr. Drzaic said. **********Mr. Sheridon, the researcher at the Xerox center, is working on a similar problem -- but instead of testing his technology on commercial signs, he is focusing on the creation of electronic paper. He has been developing thin sheets of tough rubber that can be manufactured to be almost as thin as paper. **********Thousands of tiny plastic beads are stuck in the rubber sheet, suspended in an oily ink that is also encased within the sheet. The beads have two colors: one hemisphere is white, the other black. **********Two conductive plates are applied to the back and front of the rubber sheets, enabling the conduction of electric charges. A positive charge will cause the white side of the beads to rotate upward; a negative charge will bring up the black side. As with E Ink's signs, the patterns of white and black can then create letters that form words and sentences. **********Mr. Sheridon expects that his form of electronic paper could become a useful office product: he envisions people printing out their E-mail messages onto paper for easier, more convenient reading. ''After a few days, when you don't want to use it any more, you can just erase it and start over,'' Mr. Sheridon said. ''It will save a lot of paper.''"

So Why Is My Heart Racing?,BACKSLASH; I Didn't Buy the Stock. So Why Is My Heart Racing?," **********LATELY I've been feeling guilty about my health-club regimen. Yes, I work out enough to stay in shape. But the trouble is, I almost never make thousands of dollars in the stock market at the same time. **********That failing leaves me unacquainted with the ultimate in exercise -- something called the Netpulse Station. A marvel of multitasking, the Netpulse lets you ride a stationary bike, listen to music, watch TV or DVD, surf the Web, send and receive e-mail and even engage in online trading. It puts you in front of a touch-screen computer -- at a sort of mini-office, but one where profuse perspiration is encouraged. **********You even earn sweat equity -- a reward for watching the advertising on the screen.  ''You earn airline miles for each minute you work out,'' said Tom Proulx, the president and chief executive of Netpulse Communications. **********So in the spirit of Silicon Valley, I descended recently on the Bay Club, a chichi San Francisco gym, with a vow to shed my anachronistic views of exercise. My plan  was to ride the bike, listen to tunes, surf the Web, and, in a feat of elite multitasking, use the Net to place a highly profitable stock trade. And I would do so without pharmaceutical enhancement. That's right, no ginseng. **********Even with the prospect of simultaneously strengthening my abs and my assets, I was uneasy.  Isn't exercise supposed to be a sanctuary, a time reserved for not having to be productive? Should life force us to constantly compete in a digital decathlon, in which we are made to feel lazy if we don't check our voice mail while skeet shooting? And what if a wild market swing caused me to pull a hamstring? **********Then there are the physical hazards of multitasking. Louis Tijerina, a transportation researcher and member of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society of Santa Monica, Calif., explained that doing too many things at once could lead to what is called focus depletion. That is a particular problem when people are driving, he said. (I confess to a particular fear of being run down by someone talking on the cell phone and checking e-mail while driving a sport utility vehicle to Starbucks.) **********But what about the risks of concurrently exercising and day-trading technology  stocks? ''Good luck,'' Mr. Tijerina said. ''It's your money.'' **********Mounting the Netpulse, I quickly found that the scientists had a point: It wasn't easy to perform all the tasks at hand. **********For one thing, it was difficult to type on the touch-screen while pedaling -- I spent 15 minutes just logging on. Then I surfed to the home page of my brokerage firm and couldn't find the ticker symbol for the stock I wanted to buy, Matchmaker.com. It was a tip from Jordan Shay, a personal trainer at the Bay Club, who doled out financial advice  while giving fitness counsel to other patrons. **********I also suffered a multitasking-related ailment thanks to my persistent prodding at  the touch screen -- my first-ever index-finger injury from riding a stationary bike. I was breaking a sweat all right, but it was because of my Web surfing, not my intermittent pedaling. **********After a quick break, I climbed back on the bike and renewed my assault, but with better equipment. Cell phone in hand, I called my broker for help in placing the stock trade. I logged on again and plugged my headphones into the CD player. I began to pedal, point and click, a picture of productivity, my multitasking summit in sight. **********And then, suddenly, trouble. My broker informed me that Matchmaker.com is not yet a public company, so obviously I couldn't buy the stock. Second, I had taken so long that the market had closed for the day. **********JUST like that, my effort collapsed. The day trade was not to be. I was Icarus with a cell phone. ''Well,'' Mr. Shay told me, ''that's what you get for taking stock tips from a personal trainer.'' **********As I folded my electronics and athletic shoes into my gym bag, I realized I had asked too much of him -- and of myself. Maybe I'm a mono-tasker at heart, a relatively unproductive plebe taking cues not from dot.com executives but from Thoreau and Walden Pond. Next time I'm here for a workout, I'll look up his Web site."

Stepashin, won an easy confirmation vote today in the lower house of Parliament, bringing the brief political crisis to an eerily peaceful end. **********It was just a week ago that President Boris N. Yeltsin shuffled the political deck and confounded his Communist opposition by dismissing Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov on the eve of an impeachment debate. **********The impeachment vote fizzled on Saturday, and today, even Communist legislators voted for Mr. Stepashin, a 47-year-old Yeltsin loyalist whose last position was head of the national police force. The final vote for Mr. Stepashin was 301 to 55, a comfortable majority in the 450-seat house. **********Barring additional sudden changes, Mr. Stepashin, a cautious survivor of Kremlin wars and intrigues, is in a strong position to carry a lame-duck Government through the parliamentary elections in December and, maybe, even the presidential elections in June 2000. **********After the vote, even Mr. Stepashin conceded that he had expected more resistance. ''I was preparing hard, I was nervous and I expected a lot of vicious and complex questions,'' he told Parliament. ''There were practically none today.'' **********Western analysts were also relieved, and some said they were reassured by Mr. Stepashin's early statements on economic policy and rumored Cabinet appointments. **********''I have been pleasantly surprised,'' said Margot Jacobs, an analyst for United Financial Group, an investment group here. **********By approving Mr. Stepashin on a first vote, the lower house, the Duma, sidestepped an open threat of early dissolution that under the Constitution becomes mandatory when a President's Prime Minister-designate is rejected three times. **********Even before the impeachment vote on Saturday, many members of Parliament had been looking for a way out of a confrontation with the Kremlin that would have cost them the perquisites and privileges of office just before an election. Many were also wary of further provoking a president whose behavior is notoriously erratic and whose constitutional powers remain considerable. **********In the meantime, Mr. Yeltsin's own gamble has paid off, for now. He has succeeded in ridding himself of Mr. Primakov, a Prime Minister who in recent months had irritated the Kremlin with his growing independence and increasingly close ties to the Communists. **********Publicly, Mr. Yeltsin chided Mr. Primakov for a do-nothing economic policy. Privately, his aides accused the Prime Minister of Communist sympathies that could prove dangerous if left unchecked. **********With the approval of Mr. Stepashin, Mr. Yeltsin has returned to a status that existed before Mr. Primakov, with a Government wholly dependent on the Kremlin and a Parliament dominated by his opposition. If the crisis made any real dent in the situation, it was to reveal the depth and the breadth of Mr. Yeltsin's political isolation, as moderates, nationalists and Communists took turns blaming him for the economic misery and military weakness. **********Although his popularity is at an all-time low, his powers are not to be toyed with, as Parliament was reminded again. **********''We believe that with the country half in ruins we need some sort of stability,'' Vladimir Ryzhkov, leader of the Our Home Is Russia faction in Parliament, said. ''Under our Constitution, it is the President who decides whom to appoint as Prime Minister. There is no point in resisting.'' **********Mr. Stepashin, a veteran of the security services who played a crucial role in the disastrous war in Chechnya, offered himself as a conciliatory candidate who would continue Mr. Primakov's politics of consensus while pursuing a more aggressive approach to the economic problems. **********''A simple continuity of the course of political and economic stabilization is no longer enough,'' Mr. Stepashin said. ''Changes have ripened in the very tactics of pursuing this course. There is no more place for halfhearted measures and compromise.'' **********Although he has promised to keep the ''backbone'' of the Primakov Cabinet, important personnel changes are in the offing. Two prominent Communist ministers, whose jobs Mr. Primakov went out of his way to protect, are on their way out. **********Mr. Stepashin is widely expected to appoint Aleksandr Zhukov, 43, chairman of the Duma budget committee and a veteran of the Finance Ministry, as his economics czar. **********On Tuesday, Mr. Stepashin said that he would not only champion a package of unpopular fiscal legislation sought by the International Monetary Fund, but that he would also defend it with a confidence vote in his own Government. **********Today, Russia stepped up a long promised campaign to tidy up the banking mess left by the financial collapse in August. The Central Bank revoked the licenses of 12 banks, with others expected. **********''It may not restore health to the banking sector, but it will drag away the carcasses,'' said Ms. Jacobs of United Financial."

Sega also said its losses in the first half of the fiscal year were larger than had been expected. **********The company blamed a 50 percent increase in marketing and other costs associated with the introduction of its Dreamcast video console for losses at the parent company of 19.1 billion yen, or $183.8 million at current exchange rates, in the six months that ended Sept. 30, in contrast to a profit of 1.2 billion yen in the same period last year. **********Sales rose 25 percent, to 126.4 billion yen, or $1.21 billion, 6 percent less than what the company forecast in May. **********But at a news conference this evening, the president of Sega, Shoichiro Irimajiri, said barely a word about the company's bleak financial performance, choosing to focus on plans to overhaul its business. Those plans include creating several wholly owned subsidiaries in an effort to increase accountability and profitability as well as to transform Sega into a network services provider. **********''We will focus on entertainment and networking,'' he said. ''When we include the networking business into our own business, it changes everything.'' **********Sega has plans to connect 20 game centers in the areas around Tokyo and Osaka via large computers that will allow players to participate in continuing games. Mr. Irimajiri spoke animatedly about a huge war game in cyberspace; players could choose to be tank drivers or fighter pilots and take part in a battle on a distant planet or between Russia and China. **********''We believe we can expand the borders of the game to unlimited space,'' he said. **********For those couch potatoes who prefer to stay home, Sega plans to replicate the experience in their living rooms using the Dreamcast machine and the Internet. **********When Sega makes its games available over cellular telephones, which are soon to get bigger displays capable of producing color, game enthusiasts need never quit. **********It also plans to create 10 subsidiaries out of its software research and development business and its faltering arcade business, and although these changes seem mundane by comparison, they are far more important to the company's short-term prospects. Analysts said the creation of wholly owned subsidiaries would greatly enhance accountability and thus profitability; Sega will be able to see precisely where it is losing money and where it will get the most return for capital invested. **********Mr. Irimajiri said Sega would sell 10 million Dreamcast consoles in the next fiscal year, which starts April 1. Dreamcast has so far failed to capture the hearts of Japanese consumers, in part because of supply problems and a dearth of software titles, but it has far exceeded the company's expectations in the United States, where one million consoles have been sold since September. **********The success of Dreamcast outside Japan led the company to revise its forecast for the fiscal year that will end March 31 to a loss of 10.9 billion yen, rather than the 11.4 billion yen loss it predicted earlier this year. **********Mr. Irimajiri brushed aside questions about how Dreamcast will fare when it must compete with Sony's next generation PlayStation, which will go on sale in Japan in March and in the United States and Europe later next year. The new PlayStation is designed to be a complete home entertainment center, with links to the Internet, DVD capabilities, some computer features and many of the same kinds of online group entertainment that Sega is planning. Nintendo is also coming out with a more sophisticated console. **********''We are safe because PlayStation 2 is very expensive, too expensive for the mass market,'' Mr. Irimajiri said. He said he thought it would take two or three years for the Sony machine's price to fall to $200, the high end of the range for the consumer game market."

''And by them Milosevic practically wanted to destabilize Macedonia.'' **********In a country of two million, the number of refugees who have entered the country over the last few weeks is equal to 7 percent of the population. ''It would be like having 20 million Mexicans coming in to the United States in one day,'' Mr. Georgievski said in an interview. **********The Prime Minister has had to balance the influx people with a divided population, a significant proportion of whom support or at least feel sympathy for Serbia. Forty thousand Serbs live in Macedonia, and Macedonians, who are the majority, are also Eastern Orthodox Christians. **********Ethnic Albanians, who are Muslim, represent 30 percent of the population. **********Although Macedonia could pride itself on being an example of ethnic tolerance in the Balkans, the war has inevitably polarized opinions, the Prime Minister noted. **********''The problem is that people have been made to chose between the Albanians and Serbs,'' Mr. Georgievski said. ''It should not be a question for a country that already has quite a complicated political life. **********''Milosevic is playing on the fact of Christian-Muslim conflict. I think we were very close to it. He is playing to the fears of the Christians that a surplus of refugees will make Muslims predominant.'' **********With a cautious approach, the Prime Minister, whose country is home to 12,000 NATO troops sent here as peacekeepers in 1995, has walked a precarious tightrope between NATO and Serbia. **********He is determinedly pro-West and pro-NATO, despite the fury that has provoked from Belgrade and even from many in Macedonia. He said his Government's aim was to be accepted as a full member of NATO as soon as possible. **********But the refugee crisis has provided one more sour note to a relationship  with Mr. Milosevic that already demonstrates little affection. Mr. Georgievski, who describes himself as an anti-Communist and an advocate of Macedonian independence since the 80's, noted that Mr. Milosevic refused to recognize Macedonia for five years after it gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 and that the Yugoslav President still disputed their shared border. **********The border dispute made the capture of the three American soldiers on March 31 a particularly sensitive issue. **********''Serbia does not recognize the border and disputes about 10 points along it,'' Mr. Georgievski said. ''So I assume because of this dispute they could say that they were on their territory, and we say it was on ours.'' **********The incident also raised concerns over Serbian attacks. A Macedonian soldier was killed last week at a border post. The Macedonian communique was vague, Mr. Georgievski said, adding: **********''No one has proved who fired. And it could have been a provocation. So we withheld blame.'' **********''Yugoslavia has declared us aggressors and is sending us daily diplomatic notes'' that protest NATO's use of Macedonian airspace for its bombing, he said. **********Although NATO support aircraft fly over the country -- ''You can hear them,'' Mr. Georgievski said with a shrug -- Macedonia had not given NATO permission to use its territory or air space to attack neighboring countries. **********The particular fear among Macedonians is that the Albanians want to create a ''greater Albania,'' which would eat into western Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian leaders in Macedonia have been careful to play down that grand aim and voice full support for the territorial integrity of Macedonia. Yet the issue remains in the back of the minds of many Macedonians. **********''There is a fear that after this war a greater Albania will be created,  and this is not a secret that it is frightening to Macedonians,'' Mr. Georgievski said. **********The tensions have been played out in other ways, too. Police officers have come in for strong criticism for their often callous treatment of the Albanian refugees. When asked about the treatment, Mr. Georgievski defended the authorities. He said they faced an unusual security and immigration nightmare and had at least managed to avoid a catastrophe. **********''You cannot find one refugee who was seriously injured,'' he said. ''And there has been no disease or epidemic. So in the whole chaos the Macedonian police passed this test. **********''As a state we have had a difficult 20 days. And I think we passed this exam.''"

There was a television set his 28-year-old son, Shaban, had bought for the family by working on construction jobs in Germany, along with a big music system, a refrigerator and a freezer to store food for the long winter. **********Standing on cinders this afternoon, Mr. Kryeziu looked around and sighed deeply. **********''There is nothing,'' he said. **********The original house was just a jagged jumble of old crude bricks.  The newer one, the one that he built with the family's earnings and savings seven years ago, was completely burned out, its concrete walls scorched black. The rooms were empty, the only things left were some blackened wires  and an old stove not worth taking. **********With 13 other members of his family, he had been living as a refugee across the border in Kukes, Albania, for the last two and a half months, renting a single room from an Albanian family for 150 German marks a month. **********This morning, along with thousands of other Kosovo Albanians hounded out of their homes in the  Serbian purge, he ventured back across the Morini crossing point, now controlled by German soldiers helped by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, to this village of about 300 houses a few miles southeast of Suva Reka. **********Like all the refugees, he remembered the moment the Serbs ordered him out, on Friday, March 26, two days after the NATO bombing began. **********''We could hear the shooting in the village,'' he said. ''The police came and said to the people, 'You have two minutes to leave your houses.' We grabbed our car and tractor and fled. We did not take anything.'' **********The Albanians in Kukes had been kind and tried to help, he said, ''But they were so poor, we were like Americans to them.'' **********He looked now around the family compound. His dog was shot dead, the place where the family stored the feed corn smashed, along with the garage. Scraps of clothing, including his daughter-in-law's wedding-party dress, were strewn in the doorway along with a baby bottle. The floor of every empty room crunched with cinders and charcoal. There had been two cows, but he couldn't find them. **********''I can't describe how I'm feeling,'' he said. ''I'm not really happy, but one thing that makes me happy is that my family is O.K. I know it will be really hard to rebuild this place. **********''If somebody takes only a chicken from you and kills it, you feel very sad, so you can imagine how I feel when I see my house burned.'' **********Because the refugees had been told there might be mines or booby traps in the villages, some men, including Mr. Kryeziu, came ahead to investigate. Now, he said he would go back and get his children, measuring the yard with his eye to see where he might put up a tent. **********Traditionally in this formerly Communist part of the world, people have put all the wealth they gained -- often from working abroad -- into building and constantly rebuilding their houses and filling them with consumer goods.  Burning and looting a house wipes out everything a family has accumulated over the years. **********''Why did they have to burn all of them,'' he said, looking at the charred buildings sadly. ''Why didn't they leave one of them so that when we came back we could have a shelter?''"

Even Mr. Shawlee reluctantly abandoned the slide rule -- including his first one, which took six months of saving to purchase -- when he headed to college to study computer science. **********Now 49 years old and head of a successful firm in Kelowna, British Columbia, that specializes in designing electronics systems for aircraft, Mr. Shawlee is using the latest technology to keep slide rules on life support. Through his Web site, the Slide Rule Universe (www.sphere .bc.ca/test/sruniverse.html), Mr. Shawlee has become probably the world's largest retailer of unused, if rather old, slide rules. ''There's yet to be a calculator made that's as easy to use as a slide rule,'' he said. **********The site, which features thousands of slide rules for sale, is no Amazon.com. Still, for the last 18 months it has generated $3,000 to $6,000 a month selling slide rules. Along with  pitches, there is a vast range of slide rule information. **********''Walter has done the best job in the world of putting all this together,'' said Al Kalian, a slide rule collector in San Francisco who has purchased about 25 of them from Mr. Shawlee. **********Mr. Shawlee's interest in the gadgets was revived two years ago when he found the two rules he had used in  high school while cleaning out a desk. He was struck at how simple and elegant they were to use compared with high-end electronic calculators. The Web site followed, initially as an information service after he became frustrated by the scarcity of information about slide rules. **********By reading E-mail to his site, Mr. Shawlee quickly discovered that there was an unsated demand for slide rules. But since production of general-purpose slide rules ended worldwide about 1972, as far as he can tell, used rules seemed to be the only option for the unsatisfied. **********Then Mr. Shawlee heard from Foo Cheow Ming, a government worker in Singapore, about a year and a half ago. Mr. Foo had discovered at least five wholesalers and retailers (including a street vendor) in Singapore who were stuck with piles of never-used slide rules. In the end, Mr. Shawlee imported 3,000 from Singapore and rounded up a similar number of orphaned slide rules in North America and Europe, often from school boards, to start his retail business. Its offerings include a modest pocket-size rule selling for $16 and a  $295 slide rule made in Japan and  designed to solve chemical engineering problems. **********Mr. Shawlee's largest group of customers is made up of people searching for slide rules like the ones they used at school. Slide rules are also sought by parents who want to improve their children's math skills. ''People who grow up with calculators have no number sense,'' Mr. Shawlee said. He also sells slide rules to a weather station in Antarctica, where many electronic gadgets can't take the cold. **********If Mr. Shawlee is any example, however, the chances of a slide rule resurrection are slim. While he uses them for some tasks, like currency conversions, he still relies on a battery-powered calculator for his electronics design work."

Since 1991, $1 billion has been provided to begin switching to safer alternatives, with the United States providing one-fourth of that sum. **********''Significant progress has been achieved in the last 10 years,'' Shafqat Kakakhel, deputy executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, which oversees the treaty, said at a news conference today. ''The developed countries have almost completely phased out ozone-destroying chemicals. Now it's time for the developing countries.'' **********Ozone in the stratosphere is essential to life on Earth, blocking ultraviolet rays that can harm health. The 1987 treaty was based on scientific evidence that manufactured chemicals were dangerously thinning the protective layer. **********Officials of the United Nations and the United States said this week's commitment of new funds would keep the treaty on track. But environmental groups expressed disappointment that more money was not promised and that stronger steps were not adopted to speed up progress. **********Because some chemicals keep wreaking damage for decades, the  ozone thinning has continued in the 1990's, even as total use of major ozone destroyers has declined 85 percent. The Antarctica ozone hole has widened, serious reductions have occurred over the Arctic, and detectable thinning has appeared over Europe and North America. **********This week, the European Space Agency reported unexpectedly low concentrations of ozone over northwestern Europe, with declines of as much as one-third from normal in some places."

The per-share figure was higher than the 42 cents that analysts had expected since Caterpillar had warned on March 12 that earnings in the quarter would fall as much as 50 percent. **********The better-than-expected result came at the expense of the current quarter, however.

Artustry, started by three longtime denizens of Madison Avenue, is seeking to provide both creative and strategic services to marketers that want to work outside the realm of traditional agencies. **********Since opening last fall, Artustry has landed clients that include the Chase Manhattan Bank unit of the Chase Manhattan Corporation; Tabacalera de Espana, the Spanish tobacco company, which sells cigar brands like Romeo y Julieta; Texaco Inc., and Trump Properties. The agency has already taken part in several reviews and has just been awarded the account of the Today's Man retail chain. **********The start-up of Artustry is indicative of a trend that has been reshaping the industry as unconventional alternatives to the standard full-service agency proliferate. Whether they bill themselves as consultants, research groups, hybrid agencies or what the trade publication Advertising Age describes as ''strategic communications boutiques,'' the goal of all the entrepreneurial newcomers is the same: to respond to the changing, increasingly complicated needs of clients in ways that can be sold as, to quote the old advertising promise, new and improved. **********''On the surface, what we do resembles closely what a traditional agency does,'' David Sklaver, one of the three partners at Artustry, said in a recent interview. **********A key difference, he added, is that he and his partners are following ''the production company business model, handpicking the people for the specific assignment to get the job done right rather than selling people you have on the shelf.'' **********Bob Giraldi, another partner at Artustry, said the fledgling agency was eager to look beyond the tried-and-true advertising forms, particularly the 30-second commercial, if clients require. **********For instance, said Mr. Giraldi, who joined Mr. Sklaver for the interview, Artustry hired a director of music videos to produce a promotional film for the developer Donald Trump to make prospective buyers ''feel good about spending $11 million for an apartment.'' **********And for Tabacalera, Artustry is producing print advertisements for a new cigar, Quintero, as well as an image campaign similar to what a brand consultant might develop, centered on a seal displaying the letter ''T'' and ''creating a place in the minds of cigar smokers,'' Mr. Sklaver said, focused on ''the ritual that romances the cigar.'' **********One image ad, for example, carries this headline: ''The modern cigar shares its birthplace with flamenco, bullfighting and all-night parties. (No wonder we love it so.)'' **********Mr. Sklaver's background includes stints at New York agencies like DDB Needham Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group, and Wells BDDP, now defunct. Mr. Giraldi is the director of well-known commercials for advertisers like the Pepsi-Cola Company unit of Pepsico Inc.; he will continue with his other pursuits that include Giraldi Suarez Productions, the commercial production company, and a long-running restaurant partnership. **********The third partner in Artustry is Bill Perna, who has been involved in broadcast production for agencies and independent companies. **********''We've been very impressed with what David Sklaver and his group is able to bring to the party,'' said Matt Golonka, vice president for advertising at Today's Man in Moorestown, N.J., which awarded its creative account to Artustry after a review that also included several creative boutiques that he declined to identify. **********''Reading articles in Advertising Age and Adweek showed me a number of new creative resources that are popping up,'' Mr. Golonka said, ''but a lot are attached to full-service agencies, which we didn't need.'' **********''A lot of marketers need to utilize a full-service agency because for them, one-stop shopping is important,'' he added. ''For clients like ourselves, which need creative firepower and already have an understanding of the business housed within the company, this kind of relationship is perfect.'' **********Artustry will replace Adworks in Washington, where Mr. Golonka had been the senior account manager on the Today's Man account before joining the retailer. Today's Man, which spent almost $13 million last year on advertising, Mr. Golonka said, will use Artustry ''for everything from our most visible branding work, television and radio commercials, down to the store level.'' Media services will continue to be handled by Harmelin Media in Philadelphia; Metis/ America Marketing in Richmond will continue to serve as a data base management consultant to Today's Man. **********Of course, not every effort by Artustry is, well, artistic (or artustic). Last month, Artustry was bested by a traditional agency, Trahan, Burden & Charles in Baltimore, in a review for the creative account of the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn., owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. **********''We put together a killer presentation,'' Mr. Giraldi said, which tried to capitalize on negative perceptions about the principal Foxwoods rival, Atlantic City. **********The theme? Foxwoods, ''where winning is beautiful.'' **********Now that's creative."

In addition, a number of leading politicians have called for a reassessment of Thailand's friendly ties with the United States. **********Mr. Supachai, 52, has been on the front lines of the struggle for economic revival by Thailand, the birthplace of the Asian financial crisis nearly two years ago. He is a finalist to become the new Director General of the trade organization, the 134-nation group that makes the rules of global trade, and he is widely viewed as a voice for Asia and developing nations. **********But an opposing camp, led by the United States, has formed around the candidacy of Mike Moore, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand. **********Negotiations to pick one of them have been deadlocked in heated debate at the trade organization's Geneva headquarters since last Saturday, when the four-year term of the incumbent Director General, Renato Ruggiero of Italy, expired. **********The absence of a leader at the organization is imperiling a new round of trade talks scheduled to start Nov. 30. **********''This institution will stop,'' said Rita Hayes, the American representative in Geneva. ''It will completely stop until we have a new Director General.'' **********An attempt last week by Ali Mchumo, chairman of the organization's General Council, to break the impasse seems only to have inflamed Mr. Supachai's supporters. **********Mr. Mchumo said he had determined that Mr. Moore had the support of 62 countries, versus 59 for Mr. Supachai, and that therefore Mr. Supachai should quit the race. Mr. Mchumo's calculation did not take into account 13 countries whose preferences were not determined. **********Thai officials were outraged, and said the United States was responsible for what they called a conspiracy against their candidate. Calls for retaliation intensified. **********''The lesson of the W.T.O. selection is that it's time we reviewed our foreign policy with all countries, especially the United States, which say that they are our true friends,'' said the Senate Speaker, Meechai Ruchupan, this week. ''We have to see who are our real friends and who are our real enemies. In the present world every country must have claws of its own, and that's not just in terms of arms but also strategy.'' **********Noppadol Pattama, a member of Parliament's foreign affairs committee, went further, saying, ''We might need to turn more to the European Union, Japan and China, which will increase our balance of power.'' **********Even Mr. Chuan alluded to a ''dirty tricks'' campaign against the Thai candidate and said there was ''something fishy going on'' in the selection process. **********This was a reference to a widespread sense here that Washington had been orchestrating an undeclared backstage campaign to undermine Thai interests. Officials here say the United States, despite its denials, has exercised a ''secret veto'' against Mr. Supachai, whom Washington might regard as insufficiently committed to free trade. **********In a front-page editorial, the English-language daily The Nation crystallized the resentment. The editorial accused the United States of ''betting on Moore's candidacy to fulfill its hegemonistic aspiration after having flexed its muscles in other world organizations like the United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund.'' **********After the crash of the Thai currency, the baht, in July 1997, the I.M.F. produced a $17 billion rescue package for Thailand that like the packages for other nations has resulted in painful economic austerity. Critics here have complained that these new economic policies have sacrificed the welfare of ordinary people to that of the banks. **********The critics have also complained that the United States offered only limited aid to Thailand, particularly in the early days of the crisis. **********''It's different strands intertwined together,'' said Ji Ungpakorn, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. ''It's the I.M.F. involvement in the economy and also the move to privatize state industries that have set off a nationalistic response. That's starting to cause a current of anti-Americanism.''"

He acquired that intimidating nickname because of his military prowess, but in recent years his political aim has proved nearly as unerring. **********Written off just a decade ago as in irreversible decline, the guerrilla movement Mr. Marin leads, the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, today operates in nearly half of Colombia. Little more than a week ago, the 15,000-strong army attacked more than a score of towns and military outposts, prompting President Andres Pastrana to impose a curfew in 10 of the country's 32 provinces. **********On Monday, Mr. Marin and his rebel group were scheduled to begin formal peace talks with Government negotiators in an effort to end a conflict that has lasted more than 35 years. He was doing so from a position of strength: No cease-fire has been declared, the Colombian armed forces are resentful of concessions Mr. Pastrana has made to get the insurgents to the table, and rebel leaders said they intended to continue their military campaign even as the talks took place. **********But late today, the negotiations were indefinitely postponed, the result of a dispute with the Government over the role that international observers are to play. Shortly after the postponement, five soldiers and a guerrilla were killed when an army patrol was ambushed in a working-class neighborhood of the capital here, an action that seemed aimed at bludgeoning Mr. Pastrana into further concessions. **********''Marulanda is a warrior, but it is important to remember that he took up arms for political reasons,'' said Arturo Alape, a writer and painter who is the author of ''The Lives of Tirofijo'' and two other biographies of the guerrilla leader written with Mr. Marin's cooperation. ''The FARC practices politics through arms, but it does have a political project, and that project is based on Marulanda's conception of life and history.'' **********Mr. Marin was born into a peasant family in a coffee-growing area of west-central Colombia, in 1930 by his account, in 1928 by most others. The oldest of five children, he received an elementary school education before going to work as a woodcutter, butcher, baker and candy salesman. **********His family supported the Liberal Party, and when a Liberal President was assassinated here and civil war erupted in 1948, Mr. Marin and a group of cousins took to the mountains. Although his ideological loyalties have changed markedly since then, he has never ceased being a man on the run. **********As a result, ''Marulanda's is the logic of the pursued,'' said Mr. Alape. ''You flee, but there comes a time when you have to stop, turn and strike a blow at your pursuer.'' **********Because of his peasant origins, the Colombian elite tends to ascribe to him the personality traits they associate with poor people from the countryside. In press accounts and interviews, he is often described as canny but suspicious of outsiders, unlettered and somewhat inarticulate but upright in his personal dealings. **********That image, with all the implicit class bias that flows from it, appears to color the Colombian Government's dealings with Mr. Marin, even as he outwits generals and politicians alike. ''Tirofijo is a peasant who still gives value to keeping his word, and I am not going to do anything that puts mine in doubt,'' Mr. Pastrana said last week, explaining why he was not calling off peace talks despite the rebel offensive. **********Mr. Marin is credited with having helped Mr. Pastrana, a member of the Conservative Party, win last year's election by meeting with him during the campaign, implicitly endorsing prospects for peace. Preliminary ''talks about talks'' between the two sides began in January, but Mr. Pastrana was humiliated when he showed up at the opening meeting and Mr. Marin failed to appear, sending an underling instead. **********''Marulanda is a born leader,'' said Alfredo Rangel Suarez, author of the book ''Colombia: War at the End of the Century'' and a former national security adviser. ''He is not a theoretician by any means, but he is very astute and has a great capacity for command and organization.'' Having ''built an army with his own hands,'' Mr. Marin ''has very clear objectives and fixed ideas,'' Mr. Rangel continued. ''His objective is to take power, and his ideas are Marxism-Leninism of the most basic sort.'' **********But Mr. Alape, who last met with the rebel leader about three months ago, disagrees. ''His agenda is not a social revolution but only the sort of social justice that globalization increasingly seems not to take into account,'' he said. ''He is not asking for the impossible, nor for a utopia.'' **********Still, the rebel group's platform calls for the nationalization of industry and would all but outlaw foreign investment. The group has its own Web page, but has traditionally stressed self-reliance and maintained an ironclad internal discipline, keeping a certain distance even from Cuba and revolutionary movements in Central America. **********''With their penchant for violence and sectarianism, the FARC is, with the possible exception of Sendero Luminoso in Peru, the closest thing that this continent has to the Khmer Rouge, with Tirofijo as Pol Pot,'' said a Latin American diplomat here. ''If they were ever to come to power, which is never going to happen, Colombia would surely become the harshest and most fanatical of revolutionary states.'' **********There have already been some signs of an extremist bent in the huge demilitarized zone that the Colombian Government handed over to the rebels in November as a good-faith gesture to jump-start the peace talks. During the recent offensive, which was launched from the zone, 11 residents of the rebel enclave were executed and 34 went missing, according to government estimates. **********In addition, three American environmentalists were captured and executed by a FARC unit in March on suspicion that they were C.I.A. agents. The group blamed the killings on a local commander acting improperly on his own authority, but most observers of the rebels describe their command structure as ''vertical,'' with all power flowing directly from Mr. Marin. **********Yet on a personal level, ''Tirofijo is very conservative,'' said Maria Jimena Duzan, a journalist and author who specializes in national security issues and has spent time with FARC units. While other leaders ''had bottles of cognac and other luxuries in their homes,'' she said, ''Tirofijo lived in a peasant's dwelling, a totally austere place,'' decorated only by spent cartridges and a misspelled sign that warned ''no foul language is permitted here.'' **********Mr. Marin, who has not been married as far as any of his biographers can tell, reportedly has numerous children, including a daughter who now lives in Paris, by liaisons with various women. **********Spending time around Mr. Marin in the mid 1980's, when he was in charge of military affairs and Jacobo Arenas handled political affairs, ''was like being in a medieval court,'' Ms. Duzan recalled. ''A soldier would come in, snap to attention and announce to Tirofijo that 'Felipe the Fourth has arrived,' meaning that Felipe from the fourth front was reporting.'' **********After Mr. Arenas's death from a heart attack in 1990, Mr. Marin ascended to the top spot, with his chief of security, Jorge Briceno Suarez, becoming his right-hand man. Under their leadership, the military, political and, thanks to taxes on cocaine and heroin production and a wave of kidnappings, economic fortunes of the FARC have vastly improved, and along with that, Mr. Marin's legend. **********Polls indicate that the vast majority of Colombians dislike the group and regard it as nothing but a terrorist band interested in increasing its take from drug trafficking. Mr. Alape said Mr. Marin is aware of the FARC's unpopularity, but hasn't given it very much attention. **********''This is a big failing that should be of concern to them and make them change, because otherwise it will be very costly for them,'' he said. ''With the structure and vision they have, it is hard for them to open up. They are still acting on the basis of the logic and arrogance of war.''"

Growth is coming from telecommunications service providers upgrading their networks to offer combined voice and data lines, as well as from small business customers adding Internet connections and internal networking. **********Cisco reported its results after the close of the market, with its shares settling at $58.75, down $1.0625, in Nasdaq trading. Shares rose to $60.875 in after-hours trading. Analysts said the results were essentially in line with expectations. Cisco is now the No. 1 or 2 company in every market it sells in and has been gaining market share from all its traditional competitors, the analysts said. **********For its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended July 31, Cisco reported pro forma earnings, excluding acquisition-related charges, of $727 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, up 38 percent from $525 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 48 percent, to $3.55 billion, compared with $2.40 billion a year earlier. **********Analysts had expected Cisco to report earnings of 20 cents a share, not including one-time items, according to the First Call Corporation. **********During the quarter, Cisco completed the acquisition of Amteva Technologies Inc., an Internet services company, for approximately $159 million and took a one-time charge of $81 million. Cisco completed the acquisition of Geotel Communications, a software maker, and incurred related costs of approximately $16 million. Actual earnings, including these charges was $635 million, or 18 cents a diluted share, compared with $493 million, or 15 cents a diluted share, in the corresponding period last year. **********''By providing the systems that make the Internet work, Cisco is playing a major role in helping customers thrive in the explosive Internet economy,'' John Chambers, the president and chief executive, said in a statement. ''As a result, we are growing faster than all of our key competitors and have been the fastest-growing and most profitable company in the history of the computer industry.'' **********For the year, Cisco had earnings of $2.10 billion, or 62 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.35 billion, or 42 cents a share for fiscal 1998."

They lived on the same street in Chapel Hill, N.C., played basketball after school and attended the University of North Carolina together. They're both 29, married and hard-working. But there's one glaring disparity: Mr. Aldrich is worth about $10 million, and Mr. Kille, well, isn't. **********Mr. Aldrich was the co-founder of an on-line brokerage site that was sold to Intuit in 1996; he now is president of Intuit Insurance Services. Mr. Kille teaches political science at the College of Wooster in Ohio and is working toward a Ph.D. at Ohio State. Although the two are still close, keeping in touch through E-mail, holiday cards and occasional visits, Mr. Kille sometimes wonders if he went wrong somewhere. **********''At Christmas, I was with Steven and two other friends, one of whom gave up academia to go into business, and I thought, 'Did I make the right decision?' '' said Mr. Kille (pronounced KILL-ee), who lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Wooster. **********Their contrasting stories are hardly unique, especially in a world where more and more 20-somethings seem to be founding technology companies and selling them for rich sums. **********According to the Census Bureau, the median annual income of 25- to 34-year-olds was $21,821 as of last March -- and some, burdened with debt, have negative net worth. But Jeff Skoll, 33, a founder of Ebay, the on-line auction service in California's Silicon Valley, has already piled up $10.2 million in stock. Or how about Todd Krizelman and Stephan Paternot, co-chief executives of Theglobe.com, a shopping, news and business information site that went public in November? By the end of the company's first day of trading, they were each worth about $50 million. Not bad for a couple of 25-year-olds from Cornell. **********Yet these young impresarios say they aren't all that different from you and me. Unlike many of their counterparts in the entertainment industry, who live in Beverly Hills castles and travel with entourages, they are almost apologetic about their wealth. **********Some of them say they have no time to spend their cash. And if they did, what would they buy? **********''Most of us in the Valley work so darn hard,'' Mr. Skoll said. ''It's not like we have much of a chance to slow down and appreciate the finer things.'' Like houses. Mr. Skoll still shares a home in Los Altos, Calif., with four roommates. **********Though Mr. Aldrich lives in a town house overlooking the Potomac River in Alexandria, Va. -- ''we're the youngest in our neighborhood by about 30 years'' -- he carries a mortgage and drives a beat-up 1992 Toyota Camry. **********Mr. Krizelman and Mr. Paternot breeze into their office in jeans and Theglobe.com T-shirts, ''partly for brand-building, but also because that's who we are,'' Mr. Krizelman said. They are also quick to point out that they know about suffering. They started their company in a fraternity house, paid employees in pizza, nearly flunked out of school and had no social life to speak of. When they moved to Manhattan in 1996, they rented tiny apartments -- 280 square feet in Mr. Paternot's case. **********Three years and many dollars later, they say that only the sizes of their offices and apartments have changed. Otherwise, their wealth is on paper. ''All our money's tied up in stocks -- we can't sell it, we're not planning to buy boats,'' Mr. Krizelman said. **********If anything, he said, his wealth has a greater effect on others than on him. ''The irony is that the people around you change,'' he said. ''Not our good friends -- most have become lawyers or bankers and are earning significant cash -- but people who were never friends and now want to be. You're sensitive that people might pay attention to you because of the company, and you look for people who don't have any interest in that.'' **********As for Mr. Aldrich, his money lets him and his wife, Allison, indulge in some dreams. ''My wife went to school to get her master's in art history, which is something she wouldn't have been able to do without the financial wherewithal,'' he said. **********BUT Mr. Aldrich sees Mr. Kille and his wife, Nicola, as proof that wealth is not essential for personal fulfillment. ''They're really happy,'' he said. ''It's not an issue of sitting around saying, 'We've done well and you haven't.' '' **********Mr. Aldrich often picks up the check when he dines with Mr. Kille, but it's not expected. **********Mr. Kille said Mr. Aldrich comes across as a regular guy with a large piggy bank. ''I'm happy for him,'' Mr. Kille said. ''He's worked hard, and it's not like he's Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't think Steven's going to be on the front page of the National Enquirer or Teen Beat any time soon.'' **********Still, Mr. Kille said, he's not opposed to earning a few extra bucks himself. ''I love teaching and interacting with my students,'' he said. ''But if someone wanted to pay me a couple hundred thousand dollars to do it, that would be fine.''"

Cooperation with NATO is smooth. ''We are professionals, and they are professionals,'' said one policeman. ''But the French troops are very small, at least a head smaller than us,'' he added, laughing. **********Despite the studied relaxation and the jokes, there was a sense of lingering menace here. None of the policemen would give his name, saying they are not permitted to give interviews. But they enjoyed chatting, peppering the jokes with aggressive boasts and unprintable language, relishing their aura of toughness. **********Albanians on the street today gave a wide berth to the apartment buildings that these policemen have used as a base and which are the only buildings on their street not to bear the scars of war. The Albanians stayed on the other side of the street, picking their way through broken glass and tiles, heads down. **********The division of the two populations was stark. Serbian civilians were loading belongings into cars and said they planned to leave with the police. One Serbian man, the only resident of the building who had opted to stay, sat beside the police. **********The police said that they accepted the peace deal as a political decision and that it was their job to obey. **********''NATO will have its hands full with the Albanians -- they are wild people,'' said one policeman in a canvas sun hat. ''If NATO cannot do the job, we will come back.'' **********Most of the policemen are from Mitrovica and said they did not know where they were going now, awaiting orders. **********Asked what they thought of President Slobodan Milosevic, one policeman did not hesitate. ''He is a good man, I hope he lives until he is 100 years,'' he said. ''And I will be on the first train to kill him.'' That drew laughter from the rest. **********Their commander, who spoke English, was more reflective. ''People are feeling bad,'' he said. ''They are joking about everyday things, but no one feels good about leaving.'' **********The Serbian state was obliged to fight the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, he said, acknowledging, however, that the rebels are already back in large numbers. ''This is Serbia,'' he said. ''We had to fight the extremists.'' **********''But maybe it's time to try a peaceful way,'' he added, looking at the looted and burned Albanian stores opposite. ''I do not know what happened here, but NATO bombed, and this was the revenge.'' **********He thought hard about whether Kosovo would become an Albanian entity. Serbs will leave western Kosovo, on the border with Albania, he predicted, but maybe return to northern towns, like Mitrovica. **********The Russians are not going to be any help to Kosovo's Serbs, he added. ''That they came here the first and took the airport was only good for them, not for the Serbs,'' he said. ''It was just to score a political point.''"
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/08/world/hearings-offer-view-into-private-banking.html,Jeff Gerth,1999-11-08,"Citibank's handling of large private accounts will be subject of hearings by Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations into vulnerability of private banking to money laundering; hearings, whose witnesses will include Citibank executives and ...",1721,,The New York Times,World,News,article,Hearings Offer View Into Private Banking,Hearings Offer View Into Private Banking," **********In 1997, federal bank examiners were pressing executives at Citibank Private Bank to explain the source of more than $50 million deposited into a secret account controlled by the president of Gabon, Omar Bongo, bank and Senate documents show. **********Existing Citibank profiles said President Bongo's wealth was created as ''a result of his position'' and ''donations'' from a French oil company doing business in the African nation, according to the documents. But a draft report by Democratic Senate investigators found that in responding to regulators, Citibank produced a new profile showing other sources of the wealth -- information the report says is inaccurate and unverified. **********This week, Citibank's handling of private accounts like Mr. Bongo's will be the subject of Senate hearings. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is examining the vulnerability of private banking to money laundering. **********In recent years, billions of dollars have left fragile economies, from Russia to Mexico, facilitated by Western bankers. The Senate hearings, whose witnesses will include Citibank executives and federal regulators, will offer the first detailed public look at one of the most secretive parts of the global financial system, private banking, in which wealthy customers are afforded extra discretion and care. The hearings come at a time when previously acceptable practices in private banking are undergoing new scrutiny. **********President Bongo's account is one of several the Senate is investigating that are tied to prominent foreign political leaders or their families, in Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria and Pakistan as well as Gabon. Citibank's private banking clients included such controversial figures as the sons of Gen. Sani Abacha, the Nigerian dictator; Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of Mexico's former president, and Asif Ali Zadari, the husband of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. **********In 1997, federal examiners were looking at whether Mr. Bongo's transactions should be reported as suspicious. American law bans banks from moving money earned abroad from some crimes, like drug trafficking, but not corruption. A central tenet of banking is to know your customer, and banks are required to report certain suspicious transactions to regulators. **********Yet, the committee's staff report notes, ''there is currently no statutory, regulatory or industry guidance of what is adequate due diligence.'' **********So in 1997 the regulators felt reassured after Citibank officials told them that Mr. Bongo's transactions ''are normal for the head of state of an African country,'' according to portions of the examiners' report quoted by Senate investigators. **********Mr. Bongo's profile had been revised in 1997 to say his wealth stemmed primarily from government budgeted accounts and personal oil investments in Gabon and other African countries. Senate investigators, however, found the explanations unverified and, in the first case, ''implausible and plainly contrary to Gabon's budget policy and actual spending,'' the draft report says. **********Citibank documents show that bank officials were aware of news reports that Mr. Bongo was under investigation for possibly accepting bribes from French oil executives, but they were reluctant to raise those reports with Mr. Bongo or regulators, according to the draft report. **********Mr. Bongo has not been charged with any wrongdoing. A spokesman for the Gabon Embassy in Washington declined to comment. **********A Citibank spokesman said bank officials believed that President Bongo's wealth came from legitimate sources and that he had been ''considered a distinguished head of government, supported and embraced by U.S. presidents.'' **********Meanwhile, Citibank has moved to close Mr. Bongo's account, one of 40,000 at Citibank Private Bank. Citibank estimates that only 350 of the private bank's customers are public officials or their families. **********The closing of Mr. Bongo's account follows moves by the bank's senior management to tighten supervision of sensitive accounts and to keep the bank from being used for improper purposes. **********John Reed, the chairman and co-chief executive of Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, is expected to tell the Senate committee about Citibank's new measures against money laundering and a policy adopted last year to shy away from seeking out public figures as private bank clients, according to people familiar with his prepared testimony. He is also expected to discuss how regulators now find significant improvements in the private bank's internal controls. **********The Citibank documents make clear the potential pitfalls for one of the world's most powerful and prestigious financial institutions. The Senate inquiry is such a sensitive matter for Citigroup that it hired two former senior White House lawyers, C. Boyden Gray of the Bush administration and Jane Sherburne of the Clinton administration, to help the bank prepare and respond. **********One Senate investigator said Citibank had once lobbied to have a 1992 check for $1 million from Libya to a Bongo account offshore unfrozen by the United States government, contending that Citibank could lose its business in Gabon if the payment remained frozen by anti-terrorism statutes. **********Mark Musi, the chief compliance officer for Citibank Private Bank, said, ''The Private Bank never has had a strategy to link efforts to get or retain a head of state's personal business in order to develop other business in that country.'' He added that Citibank's business in Gabon is ''extremely small'' and unaffected by the decision to close the Bongo account. **********But Raymond Baker, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution who is scheduled to testify at the hearings, worries that when Western banks help the powerful elite in less developed countries to hide their wealth -- some of which may be ill gotten -- they undercut the efforts by Western governments and entities like the International Monetary Fund to help the economies of those poorer countries. **********''It is Western taxpayers who are paying it out over the table to these countries and the private banks who take it back under the table,'' Mr. Baker said in an interview. **********He is concerned that Western banks that move corrupt money out of poorer countries may aid the client in committing crimes like tax evasion, illegal capital flight and false trade invoicing, all of which fall outside the reach of American money laundering statutes. But this movement of money, Mr. Baker added, sucks $100 billion per year out of poorer countries. **********In many ways, the interest in Citibank Private Bank stems from its involvement with Mr. Salinas. Mr. Reed is expected to tell the Senate panel that the bank has learned a lot from the now well-known Salinas affair, even though it has never been cited for any legal or regulatory violations. **********Between 1992 and 1994 the bank moved between $80 million and $100 million through Mr. Salinas's accounts, using extra confidential methods that the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of Congress, later found ''disguised'' the ''origin, destination and beneficial owner of the funds.'' **********Mr. Reed is to tell the committee that while Citibank failed then to follow its own policy, it now has much tougher rules. **********The Senate panel turned up some new details in the Salinas case, including transcripts of phone calls between Citibank officials. After Mr. Salinas's arrest in 1995 on murder charges -- he was later convicted of participating in the murder of his former brother-in-law -- the initial reaction of Citibank was to see whether his money could be shifted to Switzerland to make it more difficult for law enforcement officials to discover his assets, according to Senate aides. That idea was rejected, the aides said, when it was discovered that bank records in London and the United States, which could not be destroyed, would point to the Swiss accounts. **********The committee has also examined the case of Mr. Zadari, a former senator in Pakistan. Mr. Zadari, currently in jail on corruption charges, had about $40 million in Citibank Private Bank in Geneva. **********The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing, but internal Citibank audits as well as audits by federal bank examiners continually criticized managerial deficiencies in Citibank Private Bank in Switzerland, Senate documents show. **********Those audits and the investigation of the Salinas money led Mr. Reed to write to Citibank's board of directors in November 1997. **********''We live in a world where we have to worry about 'how someone made his/her money,' which did not used to be an issue,'' he said, according to portions of the letter excerpted in the Democratic draft report. ''Much that we had done to keep Private Banking private becomes 'wrong' in the current environment.'' **********Another case study in the Senate inquiry involves the accounts of two of General Abacha's sons -- one of whom, Muhammad, has just been charged in Nigeria with the murder of the wife of his father's leading opponent. **********The New York private banker for the Nigerian account -- the same person who handled Mr. Bongo's account -- told staff investigators that for three years he thought his clients were Nigerian businessmen rather than the sons of Nigeria's military leader, the staff report says. **********When General Abacha died unexpectedly in June 1998, the Nigerian government began looking into his family's wealth and billions of dollars of missing money. With the corruption inquiry under way, Citibank got a request from one of the general's sons, saying he urgently needed $39 million from the London account, records show. But the money was in a time deposit that could not be redeemed for a while without a financial penalty, the staff report says. **********Citibank had long accommodated the Abacha family by setting up accounts with secret names like Gelsobella and Chinquinto. So the private bank found a way to immediately transfer the $39 million and avoid the penalty, documents show. **********Citibank records one month later say the transfer was meant to be the first step in the closing of the account by the client. **********But last March, before the account could be closed, a London court issued an order in a civil suit freezing all accounts related to General Abacha. **********Citigroup's lawyers have argued that the Senate committee is on shaky jurisdictional grounds because American money laundering statutes cover only proceeds of activities in foreign countries that fall under three categories of offenses: certain drug crimes, certain violent crimes, and fraud by or against a foreign bank, according to a letter last month to the committee from Mr. Gray. **********The letter goes on to say that the Democratic staff believes that money in the accounts of Mr. Bongo, General Abacha's sons and Jaime Lusinchi, a former president of Venezuela, may have been ''derived from corruption or other improper acts against a foreign government.'' Even if true, Mr. Gray says in the letter, those offenses do not constitute crimes in the United States and thus fall outside the committee's jurisdiction."

Back then, judges often simply read the deposition testimony and ruled, with few witnesses appearing before the court in person. **********Last fall, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the antitrust case in Federal District Court, acknowledged Microsoft's objections but ruled in favor of the news organizations, saying the language of the old law was clear even if the law was little used. **********Microsoft then appealed and the appeals court stayed Judge Jackson's order, pending the company's appeal. But the appeals court allowed the deposition-taking to go forward in closed sessions, and Mr. Gates was questioned over three days in October. **********In its ruling, the appeals court compared the 1913 law to ''Tithonus to whom Zeus gave eternal life but not eternal youth.'' The law ''may well be with us longer than most anyone would wish,'' it added, but ''in our system of separated powers, it is for the Congress, not the courts, to jettison outdated statutes.'' **********Microsoft can appeal to the Supreme Court, but that move seems unlikely. The depositions will probably be released in several weeks, after testimony deemed to involve trade secrets has been deleted."

In the process the credibility of the WTO could be undermined, dealing a serious blow to the international trading system. **********Mr. Clinton, of course, is betting that his gamble will pay off, as is most of the moderate political establishment in the United States and in Europe. The assumption is that the economic reforms required by WTO membership will spur political changes that could further erode the power of the Communist Party and edge China closer toward democracy. **********The reforms mandated by the WTO would also further China's economic power by increasing its efficiency. So the calculation has to be that a stronger, more law-abiding China would be less of a threat to the rest of the world than a weaker, rogue China less integrated into the international system. That assessment, almost certainly correct, is shared by George W. Bush, the leading Republican contender to succeed Mr. Clinton. **********But it is not entirely shared by China's leaders, for whom WTO entry is also an enormous gamble. They seem to believe that the required reforms can be achieved without toppling the Communist Party from power, meaning that if their gamble pays off, in one sense Mr. Clinton's will not have. But they may be generating economic and political forces inside China that they will find hard to control. **********If the economic reforms succeed, China will offer the biggest proving ground yet for the much-debated issue of whether rising living standards inevitably lead to demands for more democracy, as many Americans and Chinese liberals argue, or whether people can grow rich happily under authoritarian rule. **********But the vast experiment will be strenuously opposed by powerful forces in both countries. In the United States, labor unions and others opposed to freer trade and to China's shoddy record on human rights will seek to block the agreement. **********The latest betting is that Congress will pass legislation granting China the trade status necessary to implement the WTO agreement in the United States. But the strength of the opposition, comprising much the same coalition that has successfully limited Mr. Clinton's authority to negotiate new trade agreements, should not be underestimated. **********China will not hold the same kind of democratic debate. But the WTO agreement could very well be opposed by much of the entrenched bureaucracy and by local political leaders who benefit from the present system of favoritism and protection for Chinese businesses. **********The agreement will certainly be extremely difficult to implement in China. It involves not only unprecedented international supervision of Chinese affairs but also the creation of a whole new body of domestic law. It means making the opaque Chinese system transparent and obliging recalcitrant local officials to follow orders from Beijing. Already some officials are openly reinterpreting the terms that China agreed last week. **********If Beijing does not fulfill its commitments, there is a risk that the understaffed WTO will be flooded with more complaints than it can handle, compromising its ability to do its job. If that happens, it will be essential for the member countries to increase the organization's meager resources. **********If, on the other hand, the agreement is fully implemented, there could be huge repercussions as state-owned enterprises are forced to close and many millions more Chinese workers lose their jobs. There will be high risks of social and political instability. **********The practical trade advantages to the United States will not be great. Even if the agreement is fully implemented, the Chinese market will be far from completely open. But the huge potential gain of bringing China closer into the fold of market democracies makes this a gamble well worth taking. **********E-mail address: thinkahead@iht.com"

Global Crossing's stock has fallen more than 17 percent since it was first rumored to be in talks to buy US West. And Qwest's shares first retreated about 25 percent after the company made its hostile offer, but they have recovered somewhat since. That decline probably isn't sitting well with Qwest shareholders, a group that includes BellSouth, which in April paid $3.5 billion for a 10 percent slice of the company. **********Brian B. Hayward, manager of the Invesco Worldwide Communications fund, owns shares of both Qwest and Global Crossing. From his office in Denver, he took some time last week to sort through the events. Here are some excerpts. **********Q. There have been a lot of combinations in this industry the last few years. Is the struggle for US West comparable with any telecommunications deal that preceded it? **********A. Worldcom going after MCI is somewhat comparable, but MCI was not a regional Bell company. But there really hasn't been a situation before this where a new upstart carrier went after a local carrier. It's going to be interesting. **********Q. Which company would benefit most from owning US West and Frontier? **********A. Of the two, it makes more sense for Qwest. But I have a lot of questions. **********Why, for starters, go after US West, the slowest-growing regional Bell in the country? Around here, it is called US Worst. If you had told me three months ago there would be a bidding war for US West, I would not have believed it. **********I think both companies are going after it because they feel they need these local assets, and that US West is about the only regional Bell left that either can afford to go after, with the exception of BellSouth, which has a stake in Qwest. **********And I am not clear why Qwest feels the need to get Frontier's assets back. If they do, they will be paying billions for assets they sold for about $400 million. **********Q. But US West does offer access to the so-called last mile into homes, doesn't it? **********A. At base, that is what they are after. It is the most complex and difficult part of the network to complete. It is also effectively impossible to duplicate because it is prohibitively expensive. But that is where the holy grail is: serving customers. The more you can offer the consumer -- local and long distance, Internet access, data transmission, you name it -- the better. **********Q. So how do you think this will play out? **********A. In the conference call after it announced its hostile offer, Qwest made it plain it was making two stand-alone offers, one for US West, the other for Frontier. **********If I were guessing, I could see Global Crossing getting Frontier and US West going with Qwest. And remember, we don't know where BellSouth is in all of this. I would have to think that at the least Qwest put in a phone call to them before they launched their bid. **********In fact, BellSouth and US West together with Qwest would make a much more formidable combination. **********Still, the premium Qwest offered over Global Crossing was taken out last Monday, the day after the deal was announced. I am sure Qwest management expected some decline in the stock price when they announced it, but I doubt they thought the stock would fall as much as it has. **********Q. How does this fight fit into the evolution of the telecommunications business? **********A. I don't know how many major worldwide telecommunications companies there will be at the end of this, maybe five or six. **********But they will be able to serve their customers end-to-end with their own plant. Long-distance carriers will not only have their own domestic backbone, but also an international one. **********Qwest has that in mind. They have a nationwide network here and are doing joint ventures internationally. **********Global Crossing is moving in the same direction: They are building trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables and have competitive local exchange plans for Europe. **********But we have years to go with the consolidation in this industry. Some of the regulatory issues with AT&T alone are going to take years to resolve. **********Q. Who are the survivors? **********A. MCI Worldcom is a survivor. They are further along in assembling these kinds of assets around the world than anyone. AT&T is another, although the joint venture approach they have internationally makes things difficult. And British Telecommunications would want to be a world player."

Whether it is a mystery novel or an architectural plan, copyright protects against unscrupulous copiers who try to steal a creative work word-for-word or brick-by-brick. **********But Mark I. Kaufman and Donald J. Meeks, two architects in Houston, have gone a step further. They have patented what they contend are novel space-saving configurations for apartment buildings and single-family dwellings. **********The patents protect not the specific plans -- as a copyright would -- but, rather, the concepts behind the buildings. **********''We're not patenting a building,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''We're patenting a circulation pattern. What we've done is solve the riddle of the hallway.'' **********The riddle for Mr. Kaufman is how to build a multifamily dwelling without the expense of a common hallway. In the case of a three-story apartment complex, for example, Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Meeks have eliminated the common breezeway, a type of hallway, that slices through the middle of many apartment buildings. **********Instead of opening onto the breezeway, the Kaufman-Meeks apartments open off of a series of staircases that are built on the exterior of the building. ''We can save from 10 to 15 percent of the cost of the building by eliminating the breezeway,'' Mr. Kaufman said. **********Mr. Kaufman acknowledged that in coming up with the plan, he and his  partner had drawn upon common architectural devices -- such as the dead-end corridors found in high-rise buildings and the outdoor corridors popular in many motel designs. **********''It's like making a new drug,'' he said. ''Most of the compounds are already known -- you just mix them together in a different way.'' **********The Kaufman-Meeks patents have raised concerns among builders and architects. The National Association of Home Builders, for example, has establish a task force to address the question of architectural patents. **********Mr. Kaufman said his firm had licensed the patents to major developers in six states, and had settled out of court with companies he and his partner have charged with infringing the patents. ''When we believe someone has infringed on our patents, we will take due course,'' he said. **********Maurice Walters, an architect with Torti Gallas & Partners/CHK in Silver Spring, Md., doubted the novelty of the Kaufman-Meeks apartment plan. ''It's clever, but it's not that clever,'' he said. ''It isn't earth-shattering by any means.'' **********But Mr. Walters was even more dubious about the aesthetics of the design. ''Those staircases are like big snouts sticking on the outside of the building,'' he said. ''They're unsightly.'' **********Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Meeks received patent 5,761,857. **********Window Lets In Ultraviolet Rays **********These days, most people are trying to get less sunlight exposure rather than more. But Charles R. Chubb, a physicist in St. Louis, has just patented a type of window that lets in the ultraviolet, or UV, rays. **********''Normal glass blocks most of the biologically important ultraviolet light,'' Mr. Chubb said. The glass in Mr. Chubb's window's lets in just a tiny amount of the ultraviolet light that helps the body manufacture vitamin D. ''When you get your vitamin D through sunlight, your body self-regulates and gets just enough,'' he said. ''When you get it through your diet you can get too much.'' **********The window includes special panels so that office workers could get maximum UV exposure during winter months but block UV light in summer months. **********Mr. Chubb received patent 5,892,619. **********A Way to Link Smoke Detectors **********New homes these days must be built with smoke detectors that are hard-wired into the electrical system. When one of these hard-wired devices detects smoke, all of the alarms in the house go off, regardless of the location of the fire. **********Paul Godwin, an inventor in Michigan, has invented a battery-operated smoke detector system that will do the same thing. ''These can be easily installed in existing older homes without the homeowner having to incur the cost of expensive rewiring,'' Mr. Godwin said. **********When one smoke alarm goes off, it sends a coded signal to fellow smoke alarms, which go off when they receive the signal. ''It's radio frequency communication that works a lot like a garage door opener,'' he said. **********Mr. Godwin's system has another feature: the alarm that is originally set off makes a louder, more intense sound, than the other smoke alarms. ''This way you know exactly what part of the house the fire is,'' he said. **********Mr. Godwin, who received patent 5,898,369, hopes to license his patent. **********Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231."

It is an elite economic research outfit, critics say, that has idled away its years in Paris representing the interests of the world's cosseted economies, as it assesses the economic pulse of the globe, passing policy judgments and occasionally admitting new members to its own clique. **********But even as the economic and financial crises of the last two years have wrenched the global economy, the role of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been shaken to its foundations, officials here say. **********The very forces of globalization that the OECD helped foster โ and which laid low the economies of many emerging nations โ have forced a restructuring at the OECD itself, its leaders and many members say. **********The OECD, says the U.S. delegate, Amy Bondurant, ""is leaner and meaner"" following reorganization. After being criticized for many years from within and without for bloat and bureaucracy, ""it now stands at the head of the line of international institutions in reforming itself and budget-cutting."" **********The OECD, said the Mexican finance minister, Angel Gurria, is having to ""roll with the punches"" and adapt to the changes โ globalization, multilateralism โ that it helped set in motion. ""It has to define its own niche,"" he said. **********At the same time, its essential role remains little changed. **********""We don't lend money,"" said Mr. Gurria, chairman of the OECD's annual ministerial meeting that opens Wednesday in Paris. ""We don't organize armies. But we do have this role that nobody else plays."" **********That role, he said, is ""to think."" **********No other organization, Mr. Gurria added, digs so deeply into economic and social causes and effects. **********If history is guide, many of the ideas that will crop up over the next few days on subjects as diverse as multilateral trade, employment and social cohesion or Balkans reconstruction will eventually show up as government policies. **********The OECD also has a unique role, not widely understood, of setting global rules for corporate governance. For example, when some countries treated corporate bribery as a crime and others as a tax deduction, the OECD was instrumental in pushing through the legislation that outlaws such corruption. **********It has also admitted such emerging countries as Mexico and South Korea. And at the meeting this week,, countries representing more than half the world's population โ Russia, China, India , Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, along with two candidate members, Argentine and Slovakia โ will be attending as participating guests. **********The OECD's secretary-general, Donald Johnston, has pointed out the dilemma facing the organization. **********Unless it adapts to a broader role, he said, the government-funded organization ""will become increasingly a marginal player with less and less influence over the evolution of the global economy."" **********But if it gets too big, he continued, it risks becoming watered down. ""We would lose part of the culture here, which is so important,"" he said. **********The organization has 29 members, ranging in size from Luxembourg to the United States. Officials say that about 35 members would probably be the ideal upper limit. **********Part of the ministerial meeting therefore will be given over to a discussion of the relationship between members and nonmembers. **********But perhaps the point is moot. **********""I think we have reached the situation where it doesn't really matter if they are in or not,"" Mr. Gurria said. Countries wanting to join the OECD have to share ""a certain view of the world,"" he added, but there is no reason why the organization could not work on different issues with different countries. **********Mr. Johnston said the main task of the institution in coming years would be to intensify its work of building institutions, maintain the momentum of global multilateralism and set a level playing field for trade. **********With its work on preventing money-laundering and its research into electronic commerce or cryptography, the OECD is already one of the main behind-the-scenes players in creating rules for international commerce. **********The organization was instrumental in drawing up rules for transfer pricing and taxation in the 50 percent or so of international trade that runs within multilateral companies. **********""If you are manufacturing in Malaysia, and adding parts in Australia for final assembly in the United States, everyone is entitled to part of the tax โ it is a very sophisticated issue, even within federations,"" Mr. Johnston said. **********Agreements on transfer pricing developed under the OECD's aegis have saved some countries billions of dollars. **********Another area in which the OECD is trying to achieve a global business consensus is devising a method to value intellectual capital, or such intangible assets as the worth of ideas in an employee's brain โ an important issue now that stock market investors value many companies more on their potential than their performance. **********The OECD also gets involved in unusual fields, such as devising an international agreement that will allow further development of the use of the radio spectrum for commercial and other purposes without obstructing the work of radio astronomers. **********Mr. Johnston said the OECD's aim was ""to ensure that this rich set of codes, guidelines and disciplines that has been developed over the past 40 years finds its way into the rest of the universe."" **********The OECD replaced the old Organization for European Economic Cooperation, which had been established in 1948 in conjunction with the Marshall Plan. The lessons from that period of reconstruction in Western Europe are still valid today as the organization seeks to find ways of helping the countries that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the nations of the Balkans. **********The organization had made a major contribution to helping countries in Eastern and Central Europe prepare for access to the European Union. **********""These countries have gradually integrated into European and world markets and that was done by the institution building that the OECD was instrumental in putting in place,"" Mr. Johnston said. **********With nations planning how to ensure the stability and development of South-east Europe once the war in Yugoslavia ends, the OECD is likely to be an important policy adviser in that region. According to Mr. Johnston, regional cooperation is essential to ensure that aid and development is spent rationally. That, he said, was the most important lesson of the Marshall Plan years. **********""Rebuilding the physical structure is one thing,"" he said, but more important is ""rebuilding the institutional and social framework โ and this depends on interdependence."" **********The organization is often the best and sometimes the only source of key statistics on economic, social, health and education issues that are directly comparable across national borders. It publishes a twice-yearly Economic Outlook as well as reports on individual countries that often attract criticism when countries find comparisons odious, as did France when an OECD report suggested that the French level of literacy was not as high as the government asserted. **********The OECD often plays the role of Cassandra, even when a country appears to be doing well economically. ""It is the job of the OECD to raise warning signals,"" Mr. Johnston said. ""And countries may take issues. But by and large I think that they are happy with the OECD review process."" **********Other institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund also issue similar economic analyses. So is there a risk of duplication? **********Unlike the IMF's research, the OECD is more concerned with identifying underlying structural weaknesses in societies and nations, Mr. Johnston said. **********Countries are free to accept or reject the OECD's advice. Some time before the collapse of economy in South Korea, a member of the organization, the OECD ""made some very strong recommendations and expressed grave reservations about certain aspects of the Korean economy from a structural point of view,"" Mr. Johnston said. It pointed to the danger posed by the heavily indebted trusts, known as chaebols, and pushed for greater liberalization of long-term capital markets. **********Some critics say that South Korea was not mature enough for OECD membership, and joined too soon. But Mr. Johnston noted: ""I think it might be better to say it should have joined a lot sooner. Had the reforms been in place, had those long-term capital markets been liberalized and had the chaebols been corrected, the Koreans would probably have been much better off when the shock came. But no one anticipated the shock."""

Pledges To Help Disarm Ulster Fighters,I.R.A. Pledges To Help Disarm Ulster Fighters," **********The Irish Republican Army said today that it ''unequivocally'' backed the Northern Ireland peace agreement, and agreed to appoint a go-between to the panel charged with disarming the paramilitaries. **********The long-sought statement made no reference to an actual turnover of weapons, and it conditioned the naming of the middleman on the establishment of the new power-sharing Northern Ireland government called for in the April 1998 peace accord. **********But in what was seen as a meaningful omission, the message did not include the I.R.A.'s previous defiant claim that the group had no intention of ever disarming. It had always dismissed disarmament as a form of surrender. **********The statement came after considerable concessions by the Ulster Unionist Party, which had insisted that disarmament precede setting up the local parliament. It also represented the most dramatic move yet in a choreographed series of reciprocal conciliatory comments and pledges this week from those involved in the rescue talks, which were mediated by a former United States senator, George J. Mitchell. **********The I.R.A. has maintained a cease-fire for more than two years in support of the role of its political wing, Sinn Fein, in peace talks. But today it made its belief in the accord explicit. **********''In our view,'' the outlawed organization said, referring to the April 1998 accord, ''the Good Friday agreement is a significant development, and we believe its full implementation will contribute to the achievement of lasting peace.'' **********Attributed to the traditional authenticating signatory, ''P. O'Neill,'' the message expressed continuing confidence in the leadership of Sinn Fein and pledged the I.R.A. to ''the search for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland.'' **********The statement was welcomed by supporters of the accord as a significant step forward, and denounced by opponents who object to moving ahead with the Protestant-Catholic coalition government without any turnover of arms beforehand. **********The quickened sequence of events has turned what had become a gradually flagging effort at bringing stability to this conflicted British province into a sudden push for peace with onrushing momentum. **********Where there was growing despair just days ago among the negotiating parties, frustrated by 19 months of delay, there is now the prospect that in two weeks, they could be taking up their positions in a new Northern Ireland government with a carefully crafted division of power between the Protestant majority and the Catholic minority. **********The 1998 accord had become deadlocked over the refusal of the Ulster Unionists to permit Sinn Fein to take its leadership seats in the new Northern Ireland assembly until the dismantling of arsenals began. Mr. Mitchell, the chairman of the original talks, was called in by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, after marathon talks in April and in July failed to budge the parties. **********The hard bargaining of the Mitchell review settled on a formula under which the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, would say he was now willing to let Sinn Fein into a government if the I.R.A. stated its intention to establish formal contact with the disarmament panel. **********Mr. Trimble made that promise Tuesday morning, and Sinn Finn followed with a supportive companion statement hours later. The stage was set for Wednesday's message from the republican guerrilla force. **********Mr. Trimble's willingness to settle for less than a real turnover of weapons was a major concession, after months of declarations that he would never abandon his party's ''no guns, no government'' stance. **********Mr. Mitchell is to submit his final report and to return to the United States on Thursday, and the success of the deal he brokered now rides on Mr. Trimble's ability to persuade the many disaffected Ulster Unionists to support him in agreeing to work with Sinn Fein. **********Mr. Trimble has apparently developed a working relationship with Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, and he will be challenged to convince party members that they can depend upon the word of Mr. Adams, long a reviled figure in their circles. The party council is to decide Nov. 27 whether to back Mr. Trimble. **********Despite the fresh momentum for approval, Mr. Trimble is risking his position as the head of the party. He got a preview tonight of what he faces from Jeffrey Donaldson, an Ulster Unionist member of the British parliament who has his own designs on the party leadership. **********Mr. Donaldson condemned the I.R.A. statement, saying, ''There is no timetable, no declaration that the so-called war is over, also no guarantee that decommissioning will ever happen.'' **********Five other Unionist members of parliament put out a statement urging party colleagues to recognize that accepting the guerrillas' pledge and letting Sinn Fein into government ''effectively removes the lines between democracy and terrorism.'' **********The Rev. Ian Paisley, head of the hardline Ulster Democrats, told the House of Commons, ''There is no place in any government connected with the United Kingdom for armed terrorists, no matter who they are.'' **********If Mr. Trimble succeeds in swaying his party, the first days of December will see the nomination of the cabinet members to run the Northern Ireland assembly and the passage of legislation in the British House of Commons to transfer home rule from London to Belfast. **********The first weapons turnover would occur the end of January, with a goal of meeting the peace accord's May deadline for full disarmament."

NY1 said it chose Mr. LaRock even though he did not have any prior journalism experience because of his familiarity with the city's notoriously Byzantine school system.

''There's so much jumping back and forth these days.'' **********Although officials with the city's Conflict of Interest Board had no comment on Mr. LaRock's case, the board's deputy counsel, Wayne Hawley, explained that unless former public employees use confidential information for private advantage, the City Charter does not bar them from using their expertise in a new position. ''You don't have to get a lobotomy when you leave government,'' he said. **********As an alumni of the city's public school system -- and the son of two current Board of Education employees -- Mr. LaRock says he is well-suited for his new profession. ''I don't see my old job and new job as adversarial,'' he said. ''A press officer is ultimately responsible to the public and the press serves the same master. **********''And besides,'' he added, ''I was never privy to a lot of sensitive information.''

https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/05/business/limits-urged-for-managers-of-pensions.html,,1999-08-05,Securities and Exchange Commission proposes rule to curb political contributions by managers seeking to influence politicians who control decisions about lucrative public pension management contracts; would limit contributions by managers to state...,640,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,Limits Urged For Managers Of Pensions,Limits Urged For Managers Of Pensions," **********The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed a rule to curb political contributions by managers of public pension funds in a bid to prevent a practice called pay to play. **********An internal review conducted by the S.E.C.'s Division of Investment Management found that money managers who are seeking to deal in the more than $2 trillion in public pension funds make political contributions aimed at influencing the politicians who control decisions about lucrative pension management contracts. **********The new rule is similar to a much-disputed rule adopted in 1994 by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory group, in response to pay-to-play practices in the municipal bond market, S.E.C. officials said. The rule faces a 75-day comment period before final consideration by the commission. **********Like the existing rule, called G-37, that restricts political contributions from investment firms to public officials who select underwriters, the new rule bars a firm from seeking asset-management contracts for two years after it or its executives make a political contribution. It also prohibits them from donating more than $250 to state and local officials who have the power to grant government contracts -- far less than the $1,000 limit on individual contributions set by Federal campaign laws. **********The two-year timeout imposed by the new rule is not a flat ban on doing business with a government client. Rather, it prohibits an adviser or an investment firm from receiving compensation for advice for two years after a contribution has been made. The timeout period could also be started by a manager's employees, consultants or family members. **********''This measure is a natural extension of our longstanding efforts to stamp out pay to play in the municipal finance world,'' said the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt. **********The proposed rule would apply to all financial advisers registered with the S.E.C. and to many unregistered advisers, including advisers of hedge funds, venture capital funds and other private investment companies that manage public money. Advisers with government contracts must keep records of their political contributions and those of their partners. But the proposed rule does not require advisers to report their contributions. **********State and municipal officials have been critical of Rule G-37, which does not apply to Federal officials, arguing that it violates First Amendment rights to make and solicit political contributions. But in 1996, the Supreme Court turned down a challenge to the rule by William B. Blount, a municipal bond broker from Montgomery, Ala., who served as the state's Democratic Party chairman, leaving the rule intact. **********The Government Finance Officers Association, which represents state and local financial officers, opposes the rule regulating contributions from bond managers as well as the new S.E.C. rule. An association spokeswoman said limits on all contributions should be consistent with Federal election law, which permits $1,000 from an individual donor to a candidate. **********Rule G-37 will put constraints on several prominent candidates in the 2000 elections. As Governors who could influence municipal bond decisions, George W. Bush of Texas, seeking the Republican presidential nomination, and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, seeking a Republican Senate nomination, would be limited in receiving contributions from people affiliated with investment firms. Wall Street is already gushing $1,000 political contributions to their competitors. **********The rule has not slowed Governor Bush's fund-raising, but Charlie Smith, executive director of the Whitman campaign, said, ''Anytime people are excluded who want to contribute, it affects the campaign, but you adapt to the climate.'' **********The current rule has a couple of clear loopholes, especially in the area of so-called soft money, the large unrestricted contributions to the national political parties. Investment firms and their executives are still among the biggest donors to both parties. **********Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a research organization, called the S.E.C. proposal ''good news'' in the current landscape of campaign finance but questioned whether it would ''actually be a significant and meaningful rule.''"

From its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., Cisco sells roughly $12 billion of products a year over the Internet -- representing fully 85 percent of its business -- to customers who shop, order and receive technical support online. **********Cisco uses a network internally, too. Employees file expense reports, handle procurement, receive training and deal with 401(k) plans and health benefit changes on an internal computer network that saves paper, time and management resources, a marked change in the last four years. **********''Before long, other companies are going to look like Cisco looks today,'' said Greg Wood, spokesman for Internet2, a next-generation, high-speed network being developed by universities and industry. **********Future developments in the Internet regarding business -- and the lauded concept of e-commerce -- should come in waves. The next wave, perhaps one to two years out, will find traditional businesses increasingly gravitating, like Cisco, to making sales and doing procurement online, and to dealing with human resource matters on internal networks, so-called intranets. **********But those who are studying the relationship between business and the still-primitive and slow Internet say that the waves that will follow in 5 or 10 years will be much more powerful and could well reshape the way business is conducted. **********This transformation will happen because, very basically but profoundly, the Internet permits ease and breadth of communication, provides newfound mobility and allows complex transactions to take place among numerous parties in far-flung regions. Although this may sound like yet more hyperbolic praise for technology, researchers like Stuart I. Feldman, director of the Institute of Advanced Commerce at I.B.M., say these Internet assets could lead to a new type of marketplace. **********Mr. Feldman, echoing a view shared by numerous researchers, suggests that in the next decade, huge, far-flung, industry-specific marketplaces will emerge -- for food or clothing, for example. In these marketplaces, the lines between individual businesses will become blurred as companies find new and unusual ways, both competitive and cooperative, to serve customers. **********The vision is that these Internet-based marketplaces will act like a combination of ancient barter-based marketplaces and Internet auctions. Consumers, whether individuals or businesses, will submit requests for products over the Internet, and businesses from around the world will vie to fill their orders, competing on service, price, quality and other features. In some cases, however, businesses may collaborate to fill orders, or turn to 3rd, 4th or 10th parties to join in elaborate barter deals. **********''The future of the marketplace harks back to the old-fashioned marketplace, or market ground,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''People got together; they argued; they traded things.'' **********But the new markets will not be so limited as those on the fields of ancient Greece. In a cyberspace environment, they will increasingly use video and become more mobile. Buyers may point-and-click their orders on a personal digital assistant whether they are trading stocks, bales of hay or tons of steel. **********Mr. Feldman said he could imagine a consumer, while returning from work, instructing his portable device to find him the best deal for groceries on the route home. ''You'll say you need a pound of hamburger, two fresh onions and a bottle of ketchup -- who will sell this to me near here in the next hour?'' Mr. Feldman said. ''All the markets in the area will be screaming: 'Me! Me!' '' **********An early example of the marriage of mobility, networks and commerce is an experiment I.B.M. is conducting in England in partnership with Safeway P.L.C., the supermarket chain. There, I.B.M. has given 170 shoppers Palm Pilots equipped with scanners and modems. The shoppers can punch in their grocery orders and the devices automatically send the orders to Safeway to be packed for the customers. A shopper can also restock the home larder by running the scanner over the bar code on items on hand (a can of peaches, say, or napkins). **********The purchase of Coca-Cola from vending machines in Finland illustrates another example of new technology at work. In an experiment, using software made by the Oracle Corporation, a consumer punches an order for a soda into a cellular phone. The phone then instructs the vending machine to kick out a Coke and debits an account to pay for it. (Of course, those without cell phones may go thirsty.) In addition, the vending machine, which is also on a network, dials its owner when it is time to be restocked with soda. **********Oracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., knows whereof it speaks when it comes to network possibilities. Like Cisco, it is considered to be on the cutting edge and a model for the near-term changes expected in many industries. But companies looking to emulate Oracle should know that the company had to undergo a substantial transformation to get to this point. **********For years, the company relied on in-person product-demonstration seminars that cost $350 per attendee to stage, including invitations, hotel space, special crews and more. Today, the company holds the majority of its seminars online -- it had 61 online presentations in October, for example, presenting material in text, video and audio, and taking questions via e-mail. The cost: $1.98 per attendee. **********''We're not talking a factor of even 100 less; we're talking a huge amount less'' in cost, said Mark Jarvis, senior vice president for worldwide marketing for Oracle. ''We were used to running marketing seminars in 144 countries worldwide. Now we do one for the entire globe.'' **********Like Cisco, Oracle has also moved many of its human resource tasks online. For example, an employee files an expense report into an automated system that not only e-mails the report to a manager to approve, but also checks the report for any anomalous expenses that could lead to an audit. Mr. Jarvis said it cost $100 to process a paper-based expense report, but $1 for one in a digital network-based world. **********Like Mr. Feldman of I.B.M., Mr. Jarvis predicts that this wave of networking technology will look insignificant compared with the waves on the horizon. He said that Oracle and other companies needed to prepare themselves for a world in which geography and price were far less significant in buying and selling decisions, and that businesses must prepare themselves to compete against and cooperate with other businesses in a virtual environment with few boundaries. **********''Everybody is looking at putting their product catalog online and thinking, 'I'm done,' '' said Mark A. Tonnesen, a senior director of information technology at Cisco Systems. ''But you've got to think about having an entire ecosystem of products and services online.'' The world ahead, he said, is one ''with multiple buyers, multiple customers and multiple complementary processes.''"

The episode comes at a tense moment in which the United States, Japan and South Korea have protested North Korea's ostensible plan to test-fire a long-range missile. **********Details are sketchy, but diplomats say a Kazakh company agreed to provide North Korea with 30 to 40 MIG-21's, a 1960's-era fighter that is still effective in an arena like the Korean Peninsula. **********For the second time in a month, Japan and South Korea have issued diplomatic protests to Kazakhstan, but the Government seems particularly worried about a diplomatic breach with the United States, a guarantor of Kazakhstan independence from Russia. **********The Clinton Administration is reviewing the matter and ''there certainly is the possibility that sanctions may be triggered,'' an American official familiar with the case said in a phone interview from Washington. **********Kazakhstan is scheduled to receive about $75 million in much-needed American aid this year, but that money and future funds are in jeopardy because of the sale, the official said. **********North Korea is one of seven nations that Washington considers sponsors of terrorism, and American law prescribes sanctions against countries that provide ''lethal military assistance'' to any of them. The State Department has a range of options, from waiving sanctions entirely to halting all assistance. **********In April, three Russian companies were barred for a year from any business with the United States after they sold antitank weapons to Syria. **********When the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, some of its military goods were in republics that eventually became independent nations, and became their property. **********While a thriving global arms market has resulted, experts say it has been relatively unusual for the weapons to be sold to nations on the American list of nations that support terrorism. **********Four months ago, the Kazakhstan Government managed to smooth over a similar incident. On March 19, Azerbaijan announced that it had impounded a Russian-registered cargo plane on a flight from Kazakhstan that was carrying six disassembled MIG-21's. **********There was confusion as to its destination. The manifest listed Slovakia. Kazakh officials said it was headed for the Czech Republic. Crew members said they were going to North Korea. Azerbaijan said the jets were headed to Yugoslavia, which is subject to a United Nations embargo and was then being bombed by NATO. In the end no conclusion was reached. **********''Maybe they didn't realize the importance of selling these planes, especially to a terrorist country like North Korea,'' a diplomat here said. ''They do now.''"

After battling off the competition, the CBS news program had landed one of the biggest Manhattan crime-story interviews of the year. **********On March 11, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, the reputed mother and son ''grifter'' con artist team who are charged with murder in the disappearance of an Upper East Side millionaire last summer, sat down with the reporter Steve Kroft for their first extensive on-camera interview. The mother and son are scheduled to go on trial in the disappearance of Irene Silverman later this year. **********But the interview, in the Manhattan Detention Center, was brief and ended badly, said a jail official who were present. After 30 largely innocuous minutes of talk, in which the Kimeses professed their innocence and discussed life before they landed behind bars, lawyers for the Kimeses objected when Mr. Kroft asked a  question about their way of life. **********The interview resumed again, jail personnel said, but was repeatedly halted by the lawyers, who said the mother and son could not answer any questions about any possible past ''bad acts'' that could be raised against them at trial. The end came when Mr. Kroft asked Mr. Kimes about college, beginning a question with ''I see from your transcripts that you got an A in acting.'' The defense lawyer, Matthew Weissman, leapt to his feet and shouted ''Cut!'', according to jail personnel. Despite much negotiation, the interview never resumed. **********Kevin Tedesco, a spokesman for ''60 Minutes,'' said he could not comment on a piece currently in production. Mr. Weissman said the Kimeses fully complied with the ground rules agreed to before the interview. **********The false start was far from a first.

Fox ended up broadcasting a statement that Mrs. Kimes left on Mr. Shawn's answering machine on Fox News Channel on March 2. **********But Mr. Shawn has not given up.

As calculated by American Express, the average round-trip fare paid by business travelers in April was $600, up 1 percent from March and up 5 percent from April 1998. **********''After a year of minimal increases, average air fare tabs are rising faster,'' said Rusty Carpenter, vice president of American Express Consulting Services Group. ''To minimize the damage to travel budgets, companies are turning to a new line of defense: Web-based booking systems. Because they display all kinds of fares, including discounted fares negotiated by corporations, users are more apt to book a lower air fare than when they make reservations over the phone.'' **********Business travel agency giants like American Express and Rosenbluth Travel, as well as companies like Oracle, offer corporations customized Web-based booking systems, which allow employees to make their own reservations using the corporation's negotiated rates and following the parameters of the corporation's travel policy. **********Employees of many companies are, however, increasingly working around these systems and going on line themselves to find Internet discounts; the air fares they find are often lower than those negotiated by their employers. In fact, in an informal survey taken last month of members of the National Business Travel Association, which represents 1,300 United States corporate travel managers, almost three-fourths of the managers said this practice was their No. 1 problem, because it interfered with their cost-control efforts. **********''The real problem for travel managers is that they've negotiated rates with one or two carriers and they have to produce volume to maintain the fare agreements,'' said Norman Sherlock, the association's executive director. ''At some companies, if an individual goes to the Internet for a fare outside the negotiated rate, the individual won't be reimbursed on his expense account.'' Mr. Sherlock declined to identify the companies. **********Mr. Sherlock also said the association was petitioning United States airlines to put their Internet discounts on computerized reservation systems to provide direct access to them for corporate travel managers and their employees. Displaying these fares on computerized reservation systems would, however, significantly increase demand, which airlines would find unacceptable. **********To get around this, Mr. Sherlock said the systems were developing special software that could restrict access to Internet fares to specific groups like corporate travel managers. He said Galileo, the system partly owned by UAL's United Airlines and other carriers, already had created such a program. **********Sam Buttrick, aviation analyst for Paine Webber, suggested that softness in United States airlines' domestic revenues -- up only 1 percent in the last eight months, despite a robust economy -- could stem, in part, from greater use by travelers of the Internet. ''The Internet has resulted in a shift in buying power and knowledge to consumers and corporations,'' he said. ''Consumers and businesses have much better pricing information now, the best they've ever had.'' **********He also said that although in some cases it might make sense for a company's employees to pay a negotiated rate, even if they find a cheaper fare on line, ''in most cases people are better off taking the lowest fare.'' Customized booking systems that give users Internet access are a good compromise solution in situations like this, he added. **********Special Fares **********With the two busiest travel months starting tomorrow, many of the nation's airlines are offering special E-mail fares, Fourth of July holiday sale fares or double frequent-flier miles for full-fare tickets in coach, business class or first class. **********Delta Air Lines started the bonus miles sweepstakes when it offered a 70 percent premium. U S Airways countered with double miles, and  AMR's American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Trans World Airlines  and United Airlines followed. **********The holiday fares, which Delta, American and United are offering, generally require departure this Friday through Sunday and return by Tuesday. In each case, restrictions apply. **********Delta's bonus offer was intended to call attention to its 70th anniversary as a passenger airline. On June 17, 1929, a five-passenger Delta monoplane took off from Love Field in Dallas, arriving in Jackson, Miss., five hours later after stops at the Louisiana cities of Shreveport and Monroe. Today Delta averages 2,600 flights a day. **********On the Town **********More than 50 New York City cultural institutions -- including museums, performing arts centers, botanical gardens and zoos -- are offering special one-hour tours that can be slotted into a business traveler's schedule. **********Available through Sept. 30 and produced by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, the tours include a walk through the South Street Seaport district and a visit to WNET, the New York area public television station. **********All tours are free, though there is an admission fee to most attractions."

Those discussions involved the public relations campaign that the company quickly devised when news broke last November that the Netscape Communications Corporation -- which the antitrust suit casts as a victim of Microsoft's monopoly -- was being acquired by America Online Inc. **********Friday's filings were the last written submissions of evidence before final oral arguments in the case begin on Sept. 21. The documents gave each side a chance to refine its own points, while taking jabs at the arguments offered by the other side. **********The Government brief, which argues that Microsoft's initial filings ''ignore most of the evidence against it,'' also seeks to capitalize on concessions that Microsoft witnesses made on the stand. **********In one instance, the Government's Friday filing alluded to a concession that a Microsoft witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, made during a closed court session of which the details had not been previously been made public. To make the case that Microsoft is a monopoly, the Justice Department wanted to demonstrate that the company was able to raise the price of the Windows operating system without fear that price increases would dampen demand. To support that, the brief says, ''After first denying it, at trial Microsoft ultimately conceded that it was able to raise the price of Windows 95 after Windows 98 came out.'' **********Microsoft's Friday filing, for its part, ranged from dismissive to contemptuous of the Government's position. **********''Plaintiffs advance a number of hopelessly speculative assertions of consumer harm'' that are ''vague and lacking in substance,'' Microsoft wrote. Among the assertions, the company said, is the contention that ''consumers would enjoy greater choice in operating systems if greater competition and innovation had occurred.'' **********Government lawyers, Microsoft said, ''should have had more demonstrable injury to consumers in mind before entangling Microsoft and the court in this lawsuit.'' **********At the same time, in its new filing, Microsoft argued once again that America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications rendered the Government's antitrust suit irrelevant. While the company's continued advocacy of that position is hardly surprising, the formative discussions behind it have only now become known, as a result of the company E-mail the Government entered into evidence last month. **********Microsoft's stance appears to have evolved during a heated debate among the company's senior public relations officers on Sunday, Nov. 22, 1998, two days before the America Online-Netscape Communications deal was announced. Parallel discussions may have taken place within the Microsoft legal team, but no evidence of that has surfaced. **********A small, speculative note about the negotiations, the first public notice of the proposed Netscape deal, ran on the Dow Jones news service on the morning of Nov. 22. Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft public relations executive, spotted it that day at 12:14 P.M. **********Mr Cullinan's initial instinct was to keep the response low key: ''We don't comment on rumors,'' he wrote to his colleagues via E-mail. ''We remain mum.'' But very quickly, hotter heads took over. **********By lunchtime, reporters started calling asking for comment, and Greg Shaw, a more senior public relations officer, offered the observation, ''This deal certainly underscores the fact that competition is vigorous in this industry.'' It was a point, Mr. Shaw said, that the company should try to get raised in every news article, ''saying this undermines the core of the case.'' **********With that, Mark Murray, the point man in the company's public relations effort in the antitrust case, got busy and drafted a detailed plan of attack for ''the next 24-48 hours.'' **********Seldom one to mince words, Mr. Murray opened his strategy memo by saying, ''This deal blows an enormous hole in the Government's case.'' He added, ''The Government should hire a contortionist to explain why they're suing Microsoft, in the face of such powerful competition.'' **********Then Mr. Murray laid out the public relations strategy and assigned workers to each of a dozen or so tasks. First, he dictated, Microsoft's lead lawyers would make comments to the cameras on the Federal courthouse steps the next morning, just before the trial opened. A Microsoft worker was assigned to ''assemble B-roll and radio sound bite packages of the courthouse step comments and disseminate to all media.'' **********Government affairs specialists ''should call sympathetic columnists,'' Mr. Murray added. And they should ''outreach to Congressional state/local officials and our core supporters.'' Meanwhile, Rick Rule, a Microsoft lawyer, ''should call the top 10-12 antitrust 'experts' who get quoted on our case, and try to sell them on the idea that this fundamentally undermines the Government's case,'' Mr. Murray wrote. **********After some additional back and forth, Brad Chase, Microsoft's chief marketing officer, weighed in at 9:10 P.M. and issued the following instruction: ''In all seriousness, if any form of this deal happens, we need all of our friends in politics to go nuts. This gives them an opening to drive a truck through, and they should be let loose.'' **********In an interview last Friday, Mr. Murray said he could not see how the E-mail messages had anything to do with the legal case. ''I am sure there were frantic E-mails at the Justice Department that day,'' Mr. Murray said. ''They were probably tearing their hair out about what this would do to their case.'' **********As the defendant, Microsoft is not able to subpoena Justice Department E-mail for the trial."

The controls, which curtail trading in the Malaysian ringgit, have effectively frozen its value. **********But he conceded that it would be necessary to ease the rule, which prevents foreign investors from repatriating their funds for a full year.

""If they are 20 times leveraged and have $100 billion there is no way that small countries can fight them."" **********He also called for greater openness about hedge fund activities. ""Let them come into each country and register themselves,"" he said. **********Mr. Mahathir said that the Malaysian economy, after contracting 6 percent in 1998, would grow about 1 percent this year. **********""We will probably have touched bottom by the second quarter of this year,"" he said. ""The stock market has improved, companies are borrowing again, and sales of houses and vehicles have been going up."" **********He added that, because of cutbacks on imports, Malaysia's foreign exchange reserves had increased by 35 percent, to $27 billion, in the last four months **********Asked what future role he could foresee in Malaysia for Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy prime minister now on trial on corruption charges, if Mr. Anwar were acquitted, Mr. Mahathir responded: ""None in my party."""
https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/12/business/ibm-sets-a-new-record-for-magnetic-disk-storage.html,John Markoff,1999-05-12,"IBM plans to announce that its researchers have set new record in magnetic-disk storage density, packing bits of data in space so small that 20 billion fit within a square inch; breakthrough, by scientists and engineers at company's Almaden Resear...",586,,The New York Times,Business Day,News,article,I.B.M. Sets a New Record For Magnetic-Disk Storage,I.B.M. Sets a New Record For Magnetic-Disk Storage," **********I.B.M. plans to announce today that its researchers have set a new record in magnetic-disk storage density, packing bits of data in a space so small that 20 billion fit within a square inch. **********In standard measurements of disk-drive capacities, 20 billion bits are the amount of data that can be stored on a 2.5 gigabyte drive. **********The breakthrough, by scientists and engineers at the company's Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose, Calif., promises to usher in an era -- merely a few years off -- in which magnetic-disk storage reach immense capacities. **********The advance is significant, researchers at the International Business Machines Corporation said, because it contrasts recent remarkable progress made by magnetic storage systems with that of silicon memory chips, long the stars of progress in computer technology. **********Until recently, the regular progress of silicon integrated circuits -- doubling in density every 18 months since the late 1960's -- has been the basic benchmark of the microelectronics world. Indeed, the rate of that advance is known as Moore's Law for the man who first observed it, Gordon Moore, a cofounder of the Intel Corporation. **********Now, however, it appears that silicon is taking a back seat to the world of magnetics. In just 17 months, I.B.M. researchers have doubled the data storage capacity of hard disks to 20 billion bits a square inch, and it appears that they will stay on that track for some time into the future. **********''We've been on a consistent faster ramp than the silicon world,'' said John Best, vice president for technology for I.B.M.'s storage division. **********Indeed, while disk drives have tended to shrink in size from washing machine-sized appliances to today's tiny 1-inch miniature systems, semiconductor chips have actually increased in size as their density gains have trailed the magnetics industry. **********The latest breakthrough in disks is a research finding significantly in advance of today's commercial disk drives. For example, the company said, 20 billion bits a square inch is three-and-a-half times the top density of products currently available. I.B.M.'s 6.4-gigabyte Travelstar disk drive for portable computers packs 5.7 billion bits into each square inch. **********The new density would permit each square inch of disk space to store 2.5 gigabytes -- equivalent to two TV-quality movies, two hours of MPEG-2 digital video, the contents of almost four CD-ROM's or the text of about 2,500 average-length novels. **********The rapidly increasing storage capacity is certain to transform the market for computer disk drives and push the devices rapidly into the consumer marketplace. Already two Silicon Valley companies, Replay Networks Inc. and Tivo Inc., have begun selling digital videocassette recorders that are powerful computers which use disk drives instead of magnetic tape to store video images. The largest Replay machine now stores about 26 hours of video images. **********Today, though, the I.B.M. scientists said they were pleased with the stability of ultrasmall magnetic areas that store digital 1's and 0's. They said that their ability to double disk capacity had largely derived from engineering advances and from improvements in an ultrasensitive magnetoresistive sensor, the technology used in the drive's ''head'' -- the component that reads data from the hard disks. **********Since 1991, when I.B.M. introduced the industry's first magnetoresistive head, data density has increased 60 percent a year. Today's drives rely on a related device known as a gigantic magnetoresistive head. The I.B.M. scientists said that at the current rate of progress, the 20 billion bit capacity will be available in about three years. **********The first technical details of this demonstration will be disclosed next week at the International Magnetics Conference in Kyongju, South Korea."

By one calculation, the combined ad revenue of the merged company, with properties in television, radio and outdoor media, would be almost $11 billion for 1999. **********In revenue from national TV networks, the merged entity, keeping the Viacom name, would be ranked first, according to Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media-industry newsletter. The broadcast and cable networks to be controlled by the new Viacom have national revenue of $5.5 billion, he estimated, ahead of the Walt Disney Company, which owns networks like ABC and ESPN, at $4.9 billion, and the NBC unit of the General Electric Company, at $4.8 billion. **********''That's not good for advertisers in terms of negotiating clout,'' Mr. Mandese said. **********''CBS already has a stranglehold on the radio marketplace,'' he added, referring to its Infinity Broadcasting division. ''The new Viacom will own more local TV stations than any other entity as well as cable networks popular with kids, teens and young adults and CBS, the leader in household viewers'' in broadcast TV. **********To be sure, consolidation has been a constant in the media world for the last decade, as evidenced by the creation of giants like Time Warner Inc. A previous owner of Paramount, Gulf and Western, inspired the comedian Mel Brooks to mock the media mega-merger trend with the derisive sobriquet Engulf & Devour. **********But to some leading agency executives, the agglomeration of strong media brands in fewer hands is no laughing matter. The deal is ''obscene,'' said Jean Pool, executive vice president and director for North American media services at J. Walter Thompson in New York, part of WPP Group. **********''There is an incredible amount of power being concentrated in one person's hands,'' she added. **********Her reference was to Mel Karmazin, the longtime radio industry maven who rose to become chief executive of CBS, orchestrating expansion moves that included the purchase of Outdoor Systems, the out-of-home advertising powerhouse. While Sumner M. Redstone will remain chairman and chief executive of Viacom, Mr. Karmazin will become president and chief operating officer of the merged company, with all operating units reporting to him. **********''He's getting such control, you can't buy around him,'' Ms. Pool said of Mr. Karmazin. **********As a member of the Media Policy Council of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the trade association, Ms. Pool has been outspoken on the subject of consolidation in radio. In some markets, CBS controls as much as 50 percent of ad revenue by owning multiple stations with various music and talk formats. **********''Concentration of station ownership in individual markets drives media buyers nuts,'' said John Kamp, a Washington-based senior vice president of the agency association, known as the Four A's. **********''We will work with the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission to make sure those agencies do what they are supposed to do,'' he added, in terms of scrutinizing media mergers. **********The CBS-Viacom deal ''is just the first you'll see in the next couple days,'' Mr. Kamp predicted as media companies rush to take advantage of the recent relaxation of rules meant to limit concentration of ownership of TV stations in local markets. **********Several agency executives echoed that forecast. ''Every time you ask 'What else could happen?' something does,'' said Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom in New York, the media services unit of Grey Advertising. He, too, said he expected more media mergers. **********''As a company, Viacom can now compete for any budget in just about any medium for just about any demographic,'' Mr. Mandel said, ''from the 2-year-olds who watch Nickelodeon to the 90-year-olds who watch 'Touched by an Angel' on CBS.'' **********But ''it will be difficult to offer 'cross-platform' deals'' that span the variegated Viacom properties, he added, because ''how many brands want to go from 2 to 90?'' **********''To steal a quote from Jon Nesvig,'' Mr. Mandel said, referring to the top sales executive at the Fox Broadcasting unit of the News Corporation, '' 'Rupert Murdoch thinks if I sell you everything, I can charge you more, and you think if you buy everything, you can pay less.' '' **********That issue was on the minds of others besides Mr. Mandel. **********''Cross-selling has almost never worked,'' said Alan Gottesman, managing director at West End Communications/Consulting in New York, since ''the customer is under no compulsion to use the medium'' offered in tandem with sibling media. **********Rather, what drives up rates, he added, ''is that the smarter, stronger media companies tend to do whatever it takes to make their properties more attractive to consumers, which tends to make them work harder for advertisers.'' **********''So if they cost more, they cost more,'' he added. **********Alec Gerster, chairman at Mediacom and another member of the Media Policy Council of the Four A's, said: ''The challenge for merged companies is to rationalize their collections of assets. And for all the combinations and cross-marketing, each individual property still has competitors, so we can still play people off one against the other.'' **********Bill Konigsberg, president and chief executive at Horizon Media in New York, a media services agency, said cross-promotion might be as important an aspect as cross-selling. **********''If CBS wants to target the 18-  to 49-year-old,'' Mr. Konigsberg said, referring to the viewer most preferred by marketers, ''there are tremendous vehicles to promote new shows via the Viacom cable properties: Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1.'' **********Most CBS fare now appeals to older consumers, requiring it to prospect elsewhere for younger viewers for programs like the Grammy Awards or the Miss Teen USA pageant. **********''The keys for any great brand are great distribution, an ability to sell the product and an ability to promote the product,'' Mr. Konigsberg said. ''Now they'll have it all.'' **********On the opposite end of the spectrum from Ms. Pool was Jim Dougherty, an analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. **********''I don't mean to sound flip, but my answer to questions about the merger is 'So what?' '' he said. **********''I've never been convinced it makes a lot of difference who owns the media,'' he added. ''What sets prices is not how many properties are united under one corporate banner but supply and demand.''"

Albright and the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, failed to yield anything that would lead to the immediate resumption of talks between Israel and Syria, a Clinton Administration official said after the session. **********Nonetheless, the official said, the meeting, which was held in the Syrian capital, Damascus, was encouraging in laying the groundwork for new Israeli-Syrian talks. **********The official, who attended the meeting and has dealt with Mr. Assad in the past, said that the Syrian leader stuck to his public demand that Israel must recognize the 1967 border between the two countries before talks can resume. **********''I can't say I heard any movement on that,'' the official said of Mr. Assad's position. But in a general sense the encounter was encouraging because Mr. Assad said he recognized the new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, as a ''serious and honorable'' man, the official said. **********Ms. Albright arrived in Syria earlier today, the day after announcing a new peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians that the Clinton Administration hopes will lift the chances of achieving a broader Middle East peace. She later traveled here to Beirut, the first visit to the Lebanese capital by a Secretary of State on an official plane since George Shultz came in 1983. **********The visit here was intended to demonstrate some important points, Administration officials said: that the time was right to widen the peace effort to include Syria and Lebanon, and that the Lebanese Government was making strides in normalizing life in the country. **********Ms. Albright met with the Lebanese Prime Minister, Selim Hoss, and expressed the desire of the United States to see talks resumed between Israel and Lebanon, her aides said. **********In Damascus, she met with the Syrian leader for the first time in two years, in a session also attended by Dennis Ross, the Administration's top Middle East negotiator, and other American officials. **********Mr. Assad, who has been in failing health, appeared in no worse condition than was expected, according to the account given afterward to reporters traveling with Ms. Albright, and he appeared to recognize the improved atmosphere for peace in the region. **********But Israel and Syria hold different views on how to restart talks and want the United States to help bring them together in a way that would produce a final agreement, the official said. The role of the United States, he said, would be as a ''facilitator.'' **********''Both sides want us to play a role to find a way for them to get together in a way that would produce a result,'' he said. **********The Syrians have said that once negotiations begin, they can be completed in a matter of months. The Israelis have not disagreed with that. **********In a meeting with the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, Ms. Albright raised the fact that Syria has been listed annually by the Clinton Administration as a state that supports terrorism, the official said. The official said that Mr. Sharaa confirmed that Damascus, in apparent preparation for making peace with the Israelis, has told Palestinian groups operating in Syria that they should stop their terrorist activities. **********After a joint news conference with Ms. Albright today, Mr. Sharaa repeated that Syria would like to ''resume the talks at the point where they left off,'' indicating that the June 1967 line remains the Syrian starting point. **********Ms. Albright said she had brought ''some assessments'' made by the United States on the particulars of the Israel-Syria negotiations before they stopped in 1996. **********Diplomats said that Washington was the depository of record for the past talks, which involved Warren M. Christopher, the former Secretary of State, and that finding a way to restart the negotiations on the basis of that record was the key to unlocking the stalemate. **********In essence, the Syrian leader has insisted on what Damascus has called an agreement by Yitzhak Rabin, when he was the Israeli Prime Minister, to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured during the 1967 war. **********Mr. Assad has specifically said that he will agree to restart negotiations only if the Israelis take as a baseline the return of the Golan Heights to the boundary of June 4, 1967, meaning that Syria's border with Israel would go to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. **********Mr. Assad has also said that Mr. Rabin promised that in the last round of talks if security measures were met for Israel, including the end of hostilities in southern Lebanon, where Israel maintains a ''security zone'' and Hezbollah guerrillas and other groups controlled by Syria operate. **********But the Israelis have said that Mr. Rabin never made such a definitive pledge and that as a new boundary, they want a border agreed to internationally in 1923, which does not reach to the Galilee shore. **********By demanding that Mr. Barak accept the 1967 line as a starting point for the talks, Mr. Assad is leaving the Israeli Prime Minister with little leverage, Israeli officials said. **********Another of Syria's conditions for talks with Israel is that a negotiating track also begin with the Lebanese, an Administration official said. **********Ms. Albright said today that the United States was willing to help Israel and Syria again to try to restart talks. President Clinton and President Assad exchanged letters in July on the prospect of resuming talks between the Israelis and the Syrians, and have spoken once on the telephone since Mr. Barak's visit to Washington in July, Administration officials said. **********Today, Ms. Albright stressed that the latest agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians should spur on the Syrians. ''We have a window of opportunity, and the light that came from yesterday's agreement should illuminate the whole region,'' she said. **********Itamar Rabinovitch, who conducted the Israeli side of the talks with the Syrians from 1993 to 1996, said that Ms. Albright's trip was vital for Mr. Barak's goal of completing a peace deal with Syria and the Palestinians at the same time, an ambitious plan that has not worked for former Israeli leaders. **********''Barak needs to know whether the Syrian track is feasible,'' Mr. Rabinovitch said."

Miller, Mazda's president. ''Various initiatives and approaches we have been implementing over the past several years are clearly showing unequivocal results.'' **********Under the direction of Ford, which owns a 33.4 percent stake in the company, Mazda has moved to sharply cut costs, focus its brand image and reduce debts. ''There's absolutely no question that the last four years has been a steady improvement of the overall structure and business at Mazda,'' said Steve Usher, an automotive analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. ''Quite simply, they have done a tremendous job of turning the company around.'' Analysts have been impressed but say Mazda must now prove that it can sell more cars and fix the financial and operational problems of its heavily indebted dealers and parts manufacturers, whose performance will be more fully reflected at the end of this fiscal year under new Japanese accounting rules. **********The company, Japan's fifth-largest auto maker, said it earned 38.7 billion yen, or about $321 million at the exchange rate that prevailed on March 31, the end of its fiscal year, compared with a loss of 6.8 billion yen a year earlier. Sales rose less than 1 percent, to 2.06 trillion yen, or $17.1 billion. The improvement in the company's earnings reflected lower costs, increased market share in Japan and better profitability in North America and Europe. The company said favorable currency movements were ''more than offset'' by slower sales in Asia and Latin America. **********Mazda's debt fell by $56.4 million,  to slightly more than $6 billion. Mr. Usher said the company's targets for this fiscal year -- to increase earnings to 40 billion yen and sales to 2.6 trillion yen -- were reasonable, although its plans to raise sales in Europe by 13 percent might be a bit aggressive. **********Led by Ford, Mazda has been restructuring since the mid-1990's after stumbling badly because of aggressive expansion during Japan's speculative bubble economy years when demand for vehicles was strong. Ford sent a four-member management team to Tokyo in 1994 and increased its stake in the company in 1996. **********Despite the surprisingly strong results released today, Mazda shares slipped 1 percent in Tokyo to 560 yen, but dealers said the decline reflected profit taking from a recent run-up in the price."

Faded posters and almanacs depict Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and martyrs killed long ago, and these aging Palestinian leaders, too, seem relics of the past. **********Once, George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh were revolutionaries in the Palestinian cause in deed as well as word, leading guerrilla warfare against Israel from Jordan and Lebanon. One is remembered by some as a hijacker, the other as a killer, though it has been more than a decade since they and their groups suspended their armed struggle. **********Now they live in limbo, not wanted by Israel and wanting no part of the peace sought by Yasir Arafat, the mainstream leader of the Palestinian Authority. Damascus is their haven, as it has been for years, and this city is home, too, to even more radical Palestinians, like Ahmed Jibril, whose group has yet to unshoulder its arms. **********Syria has played the role of host with gusto, while guests like Mr. Habash and Mr. Hawatmeh have for many years remained largely out of Western view. But the presence of such men now could prove a complication to the rekindling of peace talk between Syria and Israel, which has been given new momentum since the election in Israel of Prime Minister Ehud Barak. **********In the past, Syria's role has served to tweak Mr. Arafat, who is regarded by the leaders here as a traitor to the Arab cause for making a separate peace. And by allowing the groups to operate in Lebanon, where it is the dominant power, Syria has kept pressure on the Israelis as well. **********But if Syria is to enter a new and determined peace effort with Israel, what is to become of these radical Palestinian leaders? **********''I don't think many of these guys are looking at a long-term active future in Damascus,'' said one well-connected Syrian. **********A diplomat, conjuring up an image of onetime terrorists in bucolic retirement, said: ''According to one story, when one of the Palestinian leaders asked the Syrians what he should do if peace comes, the answer was, 'Buy a farm.' '' **********The question of their future presents a problem not merely for the Palestinian leaders themselves, but also for Syria. A desire to achieve peace with Israel in the months ahead would present Damascus with competing goals. **********It would almost certainly require some reining in of the Palestinian groups, which could lead to the benefit of having American economic sanctions on Syria lifted. But constraining the groups could also cause ill feeling among exiled Palestinians -- who include 700,000 refugees in Syria and Lebanon -- particularly if a crackdown preceded the comprehensive settlement between Israel and the Palestinians that is to determine the refugees' final status. **********The radical Palestinian groups in Syria and Lebanon cover a wide range. The most extreme, perhaps, is Mr. Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, whose forces are involved in attacks against Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, sometimes in conjunction with Syrian-backed Lebanese groups like Hezbollah. The group's barracks in the southern suburbs of Beirut and in the Bekaa region of Lebanon are regularly the target of Israeli air raids. **********At the other end of the spectrum is Mr. Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which was an active fighting force from 1964 to 1987. **********It functions now more as a social and political body that opposes Mr. Arafat's Fatah faction and that operates openly not only in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan but also in Gaza and the West Bank, where Mr. Arafat is the leader of the limited self-rule Palestinian government. **********When it comes to terrorism, Syria has usually been deft in trying to keep its hands just as clean as necessary. It does not allow the radical Palestinians to carry out any operations from its soil, and about the most radical statements that emerge from Damascus are carried on Mr. Jibril's radio station, Al Quds. **********Indeed, there is no evidence, the State Department has said, of direct Syrian involvement in terrorist acts since 1986. At about that time, under American pressure, the Syrians expelled the notorious Abu Nidal, who was reportedly blamed for organizing more than 100 attacks that killed some 280 people since 1974. **********But the fact that Syria provides a safe haven and support to the most violent of the Palestinians who reject peace, including Mr. Jibril's group and Islamic Jihad, is one reason cited by the State Department for Syria's continuation on the terrorism list. **********In separate interviews here, Mr. Hawatmeh and Mr. Habash, who is the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said they were confident that their operations would continue, even in the case of a Syrian-Israeli peace. **********In the old days, Mr. Hawatmeh, a committed leftist who was born a Greek Catholic in Salt, Jordan, led a Palestinian faction that lost 5,000 men in violence between 1965 and 1987, he said. Among the acts for which he was labeled a terrorist by Israel was the 1974 takeover of a school in the Israeli town of Maalot, a hostage operation that left more than 20 schoolchildren dead. **********Now he is 63, a slight man with a gentle demeanor who sits beneath a tattered banner that traces the outlines of historic Palestine and declares, ''God Bless Our Homeland.'' **********Mr. Habash, 72, was born in what is now Lod, Israel, to a Greek Orthodox family, studied medicine and went on to lead what became the second-largest Palestinian group. He was an ardent Marxist revolutionary and steadfast opponent of Israel's right to exist who pioneered the tactic of airline hijackings in the late 1960's and early 1970's. **********His most infamous act came in 1970, when his organization blew up three airliners after parking them in Jordan's desert. ''When we hijack a plane it has more effect than if we killed a hundred Israelis in battle,'' Mr. Habash once said. ''At least the world is talking about us now.'' **********Today, Mr. Habash tires easily, his right side almost immobile from a stroke suffered more than a decade ago. In 1992, France allowed him to enter the country for medical treatment, but that turned into a political scandal, with Jewish leaders and some French and Israeli politicians calling for his arrest. **********The paths of the two men took them to Jordan, on to Lebanon, and then, after the Israeli invasion of 1982 sent the Palestinians in flight, on different tracks. Mr. Habash took refuge in Syria and Mr. Hawatmeh went first to Algeria, where he stayed for nine years. Their military operations stopped in 1987, when the Palestinian focus shifted to the West Bank and Gaza, and the beginning of the intifada, the uprising against the Israeli occupation. **********Today, they run what are effectively political parties, both strongly opposed to Mr. Arafat's pursuit of what they regard as a deeply flawed peace. Their headquarters are near each other, in a largely residential neighborhood, and their dingy quarters with dated decor make it appear that time has all but stood still. **********Mr. Hawatmeh suggested that the newer Palestinian groups that still embrace violence, like Islamic Jihad, are more likely to face Syrian restrictions. **********''If there is a comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel, I think the Syrians will say frankly to these groups that they cannot continue military struggle,'' Mr. Hawatmeh said. **********In subtle ways, it appears that message is already being sent, Western diplomats and well-connected Syrians say. After a meeting last month between the Syrian Vice President, Abdelhalim Khaddam, and the leaders of some organizations, including Mr. Habash, there were news reports that Mr. Khaddam had gone so far as to call on the groups to halt armed activities in Lebanon now. **********Syrian authorities denied that, and Mr. Habash told a visitor that he had heard no such instructions. In an interview, Syria's Information Minister, Mohammed Salman, said that nothing about the roles played by the Palestinian groups in Syrian or Jordan had changed. **********''Such measures would be a reward to Barak,'' Mr. Salman said, referring to the Israeli Prime Minister. ''Why should Syria reward Barak in spite of the fact that he has done nothing yet to move the peace process forward?'' **********But Mr. Salman seemed to leave the door open to future limits on the more militant Palestinian operations. ''The Palestinian groups that exist in Syria have the right to exert political and informational activities,'' he said. **********People with knowledge of the talks said that some of the more radical Palestinian groups in Damascus, including the one led by Mr. Jibril, who is in his 60's, were working overtime to digest what they had heard as a clear signal that they would have to adjust. Mr. Khaddam, these people said, had simply observed that a Syrian-Israeli peace might come within a year. **********Damascus-based diplomats say it is unlikely that Syria would expel members of the radical groups, even after a signed peace. Such a step could tarnish Syria's claim that it, and not Mr. Arafat, is the true defender of the Palestinian cause. **********The diplomats say Syria would be more likely to close some training camps and to enforce an order for the fighters to retire. Radical leaders like Mr. Habash say they have no intention of leaving Syria at any time soon. Only if Mr. Arafat can somehow win a promise that every Palestinian refugee be allowed to return, Mr. Habash said, will he shake hands with his rival and conclude that the cause has been won. **********Mr. Hawatmeh, on the other hand, would like to visit the West Bank and Gaza. He still disagrees deeply with Mr. Arafat, but at a time when the Palestinians and Israel may be about to begin a final stage of negotiations it is his duty, he said, to make a personal appeal to the Palestinian leader not to give up too much. **********In the recent past, Palestinians far more notorious than he, including Mohammed Abbas, the mastermind of the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, have won permission from Israel to return. But despite three years of trying, Mr. Hawatmeh said, he has been unable to do so. **********The awkwardness of his position was underscored in February when a quick handshake with Israel's President, Ezer Weizman, at the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan set off a  political firestorm in Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu, then Prime Minister, acidly declared, ''Today he remains committed to the murder of the Jews.''"

Today, Mr. Salim had both a success and a setback in his effort to salvage his tottering empire. **********Salim Group announced a deal to sell its Singapore property holdings to a leading Philippine entrepreneur for $183 million. At the same time, Salim's plan to sell 60 percent of its giant food company hit a snag, when one of the two buyers, the Nissin Food Products Company of Japan, withdrew from the deal. **********The other buyer, the First Pacific Company of Hong Kong, said it still intended to acquire a 30 percent stake in the company, PT Indofoods Sukses Makmur. First Pacific said it might eventually increase the stake. **********But for now, Nissin's departure cuts the value of the deal in half, to $285 million. That is another dose of bitter medicine for the Salim Group, which was devastated by Indonesia's economic collapse and is desperately shedding assets to pay off $5 billion in debt to the Indonesian Government. **********''We have several categories of problems to solve,'' Mr. Salim, 49, said in a rare interview here today. ''For Singapore, I think this deal is milestone No. 1. And I believe we will be in good shape on the Indonesian side.'' **********Mr. Salim's progress is closely watched here as an indication of  how Indonesia's corporate sector will overcome its crushing debt burden. After months of negotiations, two major Indonesian companies, Bakrie and PT Mulia Industrindo, reached agreements this week with their banks to reorganize debts of $1.02 billion and $550 million, respectively. **********''It's not a tidal wave, but there is movement,'' said James W. Castle, the head of the Castle Group, a consulting firm here. ''Nothing had been accomplished for so long that you wondered whether anything ever would.'' **********Mr. Castle said each new deal would encourage more agreements, since banks and buyers of assets would have benchmarks from which to negotiate. No seller is under sharper scrutiny than Salim Group. **********Founded by Mr. Salim's father, Liem Sioe Liong, it grew through close ties with Indonesia's former President, Suharto, into a $20 billion colossus and a symbol of crony capitalism. **********When Mr. Suharto stepped down last May amid fierce riots and street protests, the upheaval seemed to take down his wealthiest crony as well. Angry mobs burned down Mr. Liem's house in Jakarta, and panicked depositors stormed a Salim-owned bank, Bank Central Asia, to withdraw their money. **********In seven days, Bank Central Asia lost 42 percent of its deposits. The bank run, on top of an 80 percent devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah, left Salim staggering under $5 billion in bad loans. In September, the Government took over B.C.A. and bailed out its depositors in return for stakes in hundreds of Salim companies. **********''The events in Indonesia were not by anybody's design or liking,'' Mr. Salim said. ''They just happened. It impacted the well-being of our group, and we've had to adapt ourselves accordingly.'' **********To repay the Government and perhaps repurchase B.C.A., Mr. Salim has been trying to sell stakes in his major holdings. In addition to Indofood, these include the country's largest cement producer, Indocement; its second-largest car maker, Indomobil, and the world's largest flour mill, Bogosari. **********Although analysts generally praise Salim's assets and management, the divestiture process has been full of difficulty. **********Last month, Salim agreed to sell its Singapore assets to a Hong Kong property developer, HKR International. But that deal foundered after HKR contended that the division would not achieve the profit targets that had been agreed upon as a condition of the sale. Mr. Salim said today's deal, with the Philippine entrepreneur John Gokongwei was solid and worth just as much. **********In the Indofood deal, announced in December, Mr. Salim was able to boast that he had lured a major Japanese food company as an investor. But after creditors of Indofood balked at some of the terms, Nissin grew uncomfortable. **********Now, Mr. Salim is left with a $285 million investment by First Pacific, a Hong Kong conglomerate that is 53.5 percent owned by his family and associated investors. The coziness of the arrangement has made analysts question whether one part of the Salim empire is simply bailing out another. **********''This is an attempt to ship Indofoods overseas,'' said Rosalina Lazuardi, an analyst who follows Indofoods at PT Vickers Ballas Tamara, a brokerage firm here. ''The lender of last resort is First Pacific. It's a blue-chip stock in Hong Kong, and it's got plenty of cash on hand.'' **********Executives at First Pacific, however, said they were getting a chance to invest in Indofood, the world's largest producer of instant noodles, at a 24 percent discount to its current market value. **********''From the very beginning, we said that Indofood was a great company and that we wanted to invest in it,'' said Thomas Yasuda, the managing director of First Pacific. ''We're disappointed we couldn't proceed with the Nissin deal, but we're determined to proceed on our own.'' **********For Mr. Salim, who spent today -- like every day -- engaged in financial triage, any deal that brings in cash is a step forward. ''We have to be realistic and solve the problem,'' he said. ''This is part of the solution.''"

When The Money Report first looked at these funds in early January, all but one bore European names, such as Leonardo Da Vinci, Galileo, Columbus and Mona Lisa. **********Only Musashi, the swordsman and strategist who wrote the ""Book of Five Rings,"" represented Japan among the fund names. This use of historic figures offers inexpensive, if not entirely flexible, celebrity sponsorship. **********Nobunaga, who died in 1582, about two years before Musashi was born, also is remembered as an astute strategist whose methods were both innovative and brutal. With his name, Jardine Fleming seeks to evoke his far-sighted initiatives such as replacing swords with guns, opening to foreign cultures and promoting open markets. **********In keeping with this visionary aspect, the fund aims to invest in creative companies that have emerged as leaders in the changing Japanese economy. **********Among its core holdings will be Ryohin Keikaku Inc., a diversified wholesaler and retailer; Softbank Corp., the publisher and software distributor; Hikari Tsushin Inc., a vendor of telecommunications equipment, and Bellsystem 24 Inc., a telemarketer. **********There is one caveat: Nobunaga was assassinated by one a former follower, Mitsuhide Akechi.

Ms. Minow argued that the foundations'  aversion to risk had hamstrung the company, which while actually based in Chappaqua, N.Y., has nearby Pleasantville as its postal address. Reader's Digest, she said, is years behind the rest of corporate America. **********''In a movie called 'Pleasantville,' two young people bring a black-and-white community stuck in 1958 into the world of modern reality and color,'' she said at the meeting. ''It is impossible not to think of that today as we visit Pleasantville, N.Y., to see whether it, too, will move beyond the 1950's aura in which it seems to have been floundering.'' **********The fund's proposal, however, was later rejected. Nonetheless, the effort was a perfect opportunity for Ms. Minow to marry her two careers and passions. **********By day -- or three days a week, to be exact -- she is the public face of Lens, an activist shareholder firm she co-founded in 1992 to invest in companies that are underperforming for reasons that Lens thinks it can change, such as a board that is reluctant to take drastic action because it is too cozy with management. **********Lens, flush from successes in battles with companies like Sears, Roebuck, Stone & Webster and Waste Management, has posted an average annual return of 25 percent the last six years. Lens recently doubled its size when Hermes Pensions Management of Britain announced it would join forces and invest $100 million in the fund. **********Ms. Minow is the public advocate for many of the Lens efforts in part because of her knack for sound bites. She has, for example, been known to cite the physicist Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in comparing boards to subatomic particles.''They behave differently when they are observed,'' she noted, ''and my job is to let them know that I'm observing them.'' **********She has also compared corporations to sharks: ''No malevolence, no intentional harm, just something designed with sublime efficiency for self-preservation, which is accomplished without any capacity to factor in the consequences to others.'' **********Still, Ms. Minow has managed to win the respect of many executives  of companies she has taken on. ''She is somebody who is very clear about what she wants, very logical, very reasonable, but very determined,'' said Thomas O. Ryder, the chairman of Reader's Digest. **********Ms. Minow is also known as Movie Mom. Since 1995, she has run a Web site (www.moviemom.com) on which she reviews current movies and suggests the best films for families. She has also written for magazines like Parents, Family Fun and Child. **********In April, Avon Books will publish ''The Movie Mom's Guide to Family Movies,'' which includes advice on how parents can be more involved in choosing and watching movies with their children. Among other things, she recommends a regular ''detox'' of no movies or TV for a week or two so children remain engaged, rather than numbed, by what they watch. **********For most people, holding down one job is tough enough. But Ms. Minow, 46 years old, is a rare example of someone who is pursuing two consuming interests simultaneously. And her interest in movies has helped liven up the often rarefied world of corporate governance. **********For instance, during one effort to persuade a board to see things her way, she told the directors: ''Remember that scene near the end of 'Frankenstein,' when the people from the village storm the castle carrying torches? That's what the shareholders are going to do if you keep going in this direction.'' **********She has often described chief executives who are in denial about poor performance as being like the Wizard of Oz, who says, ''Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.'' And after Sears reduced the number of its directors to rebuff an effort by  Robert A. G. Monks, the other co-founder of Lens, to join the board, she wrote a critical article about the company titled, ''Honey, I Shrunk the Board.'' **********She is also waiting -- very patiently, mind you -- for the day somebody calls her with a request to suggest movies for the ultimate corporate film festival. Her candidates include ''The Solid Gold Cadillac,'' about a woman who with just 10 shares of stock topples a corrupt management; ''Roger & Me,'' which chronicled General Motors' layoffs in Flint, Mich.; ''Wall Street'' (greed is not always good), and for its lessons on leadership for chief executives, ''The Adventures of Robin Hood.'' **********As worlds apart as her interests in movies and corporate governance may seem, there are many similarities, Ms. Minow said. Both movies and companies often start out with a grand vision, but for reasons that have long intrigued Ms. Minow, something often gets lost in the execution. So big-budget movies with brand-name stars and proven directors often flop, and boards and executive ranks are studded with well-qualified professionals who often fail to live up to their promise. **********''There actually is some consistency in my two passions in my life,'' she said, characteristically relying on a movie allusion to explain her point. In a scene from ''Inherit the Wind,'' the movie based on the Scopes trial. Spencer Tracy is cross-examining Fredric March and pins him down in his interpretation of the Bible as literal truth. The March character blusters, ''I don't think about what I don't think about.'' The Tracy character then asks him, ''Do you ever think about what you do think about?'' **********''In the book and in my interactions with companies,'' she said, ''that is the question I try to get people to answer.'' **********Ms. Minow received some early training in critical thinking from her parents. She and her two sisters were generally not allowed to watch television, but her mother and father were big movie fans and often gathered around the television on Sunday night for the weekly Disney movie. Her father, in particular, was a tough audience: Newton N. Minow, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, called television a ''vast wasteland'' in a famous speech in 1961. **********Ms. Minow's interest in movies grew exponentially when at age 16 she came down with a bad case of mononucleosis just before summer break. She spent the whole summer in bed, a great deal of it watching a varied diet of movies. **********''I had always loved movies, but I then really learned about movies,'' she said. **********She brought a television, not a stereo, to college, and began watching an average of a movie a day, a habit she would maintain for the next 16 years, until her son was born (she has since cut back to about three a week). In college, she often wrote essays with a movie playing. ''Ideally, it was a movie I've already seen once,'' she said. ''It's the perfect way to write a paper.'' **********Her career started developing two tracks. She went to law school -- ''the default protocol in my family'' -- and during summers worked in  Federal and state prosecutors' offices in Chicago. **********But she started doubting whether she wanted to be a lawyer, and sent a script to ''Days of Our Lives.'' She was offered a job as a writer, but then the boyfriend she had known since high school, David B. Apatoff, asked her to marry him and move to Washington. **********Ms. Minow worked for the Environmental Protection Agency and then the Office of Management and Budget, studying ''implementation issues,'' or why good ideas and plans become subverted. She met Mr. Monks, and he asked her to help him start Institutional Shareholder Services, or I.S.S., to advise pension funds on how to vote their corporate proxies on matters relating to shareholder rights. Ms. Minow, a new mother at the time, told him she only wanted to work a few days a week. He said fine. She kept the same arrangement when she left I.S.S. as president and joined Mr. Monks to form Lens in 1992. **********''Ironically, my decision to work three days a week has resulted in much more professional success than I would otherwise have had  because I've had to think very creatively about my career,'' she said. **********At Lens, the strategy for working with companies is fairly simple. After studying the corporation and its industry, Lens develops a plan to lift its performance. It then approaches the company with three options: deal with the Lens plan, come up with a better plan or explain what is wrong with the Lens plan. If Lens meets resistance, it will try to rally other large shareholders, using Ms. Minow's knack for sound bites to galvanize support. **********''Nell finds the exact right words, something out of contemporary culture,'' Mr. Monks said, ''that are always better than all the polysyllabic Harvard words I can manage.'' **********When many shareholders of Occidental Petroleum tried unsuccessfully to block the company and its former chairman, Armand Hammer, from using shareholders' money to build a museum, Ms. Minow wrote an article for the I.S.S. newsletter in 1990 titled, ''Please Hammer Don't Hurt Us; Delaware Court to Shareholders: You Can't Touch This.'' **********Aside from giving her the rare opportunity to make allusions to the rap star M. C. Hammer in an article about corporate governance, the episode remains fodder for a screenplay that Ms. Minow said she would like to write someday called ''Hammering Hammer.'' **********''This is what Hollywood is for,'' she said. ''I'd rewrite that one and make it a Rocky story, with the shareholders winning in the end.''"

He was 83. **********Mr. Drapeau, who left office in 1986, had been in fragile health since suffering a stroke several years ago. He had been in the hospital since July 5. **********Throughout Canada, Mr. Drapeau is remembered as the Mayor who turned Montreal from a declining, crime-beleaguered city into an international gem by bringing it a subway, a world's fair, an Olympics, a Major League Baseball team and remarkable architectural projects. **********Pierre Bourque, the current Mayor, observed that when Mr. Drapeau  became Mayor in 1954, ''parts of the city were very poor and Montreal was a divided city.'' **********''He brought Montreal into the Modern Age.'' **********Jean Chretien, Canada's Prime Minister, said Mr. Drapeau had won ''a rightful place among the ranks of the finest leaders and statesmen that Canada has ever produced.'' **********More muted, but nonetheless evident in public recollections, were mentions of some of Mr. Drapeau's  more Quixotic and extravagant projects that continued to burden the city with debt long after he left office. The most striking example of both the heady days of preening in the 1960's and 70's and the fiscal hangover that followed in the 80's is the stadium with the retractable roof that was built for the 1970 Olympics at a cost that Mr. Drapeau originally projected at $120 million. **********By 1991, when a 55-ton chunk of concrete fell from the outer wall of the stadium, forcing the Montreal Expos to find another place for their home games, the bill for its building and repair had risen to $2 billion, forcing city residents to pay a special property tax. A federal Canadian commission investigating the Olympic expenditures laid most of the blame for vast overruns on Mayor Drapeau, charging that no cost limit were ever set by him. **********For his part Mayor Drapeau dismissed such criticism by saying, ''The Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby.'' **********Toward the end of his reign, some extravagant projects reduced his popularity and criticisms sprouted. Nick Auf Der Maur, an elected Councilman and a columnist for the Montreal Gazette, who praised the Mayor for having been ''a master builder,'' scorned his go-it-alone style of governance. He said he and 56 other councilmen were being paid salaries of $22,000 a year ''to come down once every two or three months and approve two or three hundred resolutions the Mayor had put together.'' **********In an obituary today in The Montreal Gazette, Mr. Drapeau was likened to Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago as ''the last of a breed of North American big-city bosses.'' But as a boss, he had his own style, projecting the modesty of a neighborhood fellow who drove his own car, lived in the house he always lived in and retired on a city pension of $29,000 and valued his own counsel above any other. **********For most of his career the mix worked well, both to build up Montreal and its allure and to secure Mr. Drapeau's reputation, not as a great democrat, but as a man who changed the face of a great metropolis. Once, he had described his vision: ''Let Toronto be Milan and Montreal can be Rome.'' **********And indeed despite the questionable projects, there were many more  successes: the rubber-wheeled subway, the towers of Place Ville-Marie, the Habitat housing complex designed by Moshe Safdie. **********Today, Mayor Bourque noted that Mr. Drapeau also ''improved quality of life by planting trees, creating parks and opening swimming pools.'' Years ago, Mr. Drapeau had spoken of what the grandeur of a city can mean to even its poorest residents. ''People's lives do not have to be drab and dreary and wrapped in old newspapers. They deserve something for the soul and noble visions.'' **********A man of medium height with a pencil mustache and dark eyes and a presence that The New Yorker once described as ''commanding without being aggressive,'' Mr. Drapeau was a descendant of French settlers who arrived in Montreal in 1642, the year it was founded. **********In a city then known for its gangsters, bordellos and gambling, Mr. Drapeau became a crusading prosecutor, and was elected Mayor in 1954 as the candidate of the Civic Action League. In office he stressed  vigorous law enforcement and achieved a reduction in crime statistics. A passionate opera lover, he also put through his first big building project, a 3,000-seat concert hall whose financing and location had been a matter of inconclusive debate for 25 years. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Drapeau soon came into conflict with the City Council and the Quebec political machine led by Maurice Duplessis, who defeated him in 1957. Regaining the Mayor's office in 1960, he began a streak of triumphs that ended only when he stepped down 26 years later. This tenure coincided with Quebec's silent revolution, a period of French Canadian resurgence in which the power of the Catholic Church and Mr. Duplessis lessened sharply. **********Mr. Drapeau quickly found ways to reduce the prerogatives of the Council and intensified his building program. A few days after Le Metro, the transit system opened in 1966, a Mayoral election was held in which Mr. Drapeau won his fourth term by a vote that fell just short of unanimous. **********He is survived by his wife, Marie-Claire, whom he married in 1945, and his sons, Pierre, Michel and Francois."

NATO strikes destroyed it completely, putting more than 15,000 people out of work, plus an additional 40,000 who worked at 120 subcontractors. **********The Sloboda factory in Cacak made vacuum cleaners and ovens, as well as ammunition. In five NATO raids, the factory has been ruined, and 5,000 people are out of work. **********In Krusevac, the 14 Oktobar factory made heavy construction equipment and bulldozers, as well as reconditioning tank engines. NATO bombs have left it a complete ruin, putting more than 7,000 people out of their jobs, a quarter of the town's work force. **********The oil industry, a profitable part of the economy and a prime candidate for early privatization, has been almost completely devastated, with the two refineries in Yugoslavia  blasted, and most of their storage tanks exploded. **********The five-week air campaign, intended to change President Slobodan Milosevic's policies toward the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, is also destroying the country's civilian industrial capacity and public works, including its highway, rail and communications networks. **********The air war has halved economic output and thrown more than 100,000 people out of work, Western-trained and independent economists said. **********Although it is difficult to estimate the cost of replacements and repairs if the war stops today, the economists said, the damage has had greater effects on the gross domestic product than the Nazi and, then, the Allied bombing of Yugoslavia, which was a much more rural country in World War II. **********The bombing has added to the problems of the past decade like economic mismanagement, cronyism, the hyperinflation of 1992 and 1993, the Bosnian war trade embargo from 1992 to 1995, eight years of virtually no foreign investment and almost constant war. **********''Politics aside, this is an economic and humanitarian catastrophe,'' Mladjan Dinkic, a professor of economics at Belgrade University, said. ''While the Serbs won't die of hunger -- agricultural production will continue, even without fertilizers -- our industrial base will be destroyed and the size of the economy cut in half.'' **********Professor Dinkic coordinates the Group 17 of economists, some from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, who had American financing to promote a market economy. They estimate that gross domestic product per capita, $3,000 in 1989, before the economic sanctions began in May 1992, dropped to $1,650 in 1997. In view of the large black market, that figure was probably closer to $2,000, Professor Dinkic said. It will drop below $1,000 if the war stops now, he said. And unemployment, officially 27 percent last year, is quite likely to double, he added, with up to 500,000 people laid off or out of work and 100,000 or so seeking to emigrate from a country of 10 million people. **********Though he readily concedes that considerable guesswork goes into all the figures -- damage estimates range from $40 billion to $100 billion -- Professor Dinkic said however the war ended the future would be difficult. **********NATO says its raids are intended to force Mr. Milosevic to change his policies in Kosovo and to ''degrade and destroy'' the military ability to carry them out. But more and more, NATO is ignoring the civilian-military distinction. It is going after ''high value targets'' that are dear to Mr. Milosevic, his Government, his family and his friends, who control sectors like cigarette production. **********But targets like a cigarette factory in Nis that NATO recently destroyed are not essentially military, but civilian or psychological. The lines for cigarettes are now enormous in Belgrade, and that may be NATO's point. And NATO officials will be pleased with the new limits on gasoline rations, which were cut on Tuesday, from 10 gallons a month to 5. **********Although markets are still full of produce, people worry, too, about the quality of that food and the produce being grown. Fertilizer plants have been bombed, as have chemical plants that are said to be spewing toxic fumes. **********The Serbian Environment Minister, Branislav Lazic, said today that large quantities of chlorine and other noxious gases had been released into the air because of the bombing of a refinery and petrochemical plant at Pancevo, 10 miles northeast of here. **********The environmental consequences of the bombing ''knows no borders,'' Mr. Lazic said, warning that the damage may be felt in other parts of the Balkans and elsewhere in Europe. **********There is no question that ordinary people in this capital are increasingly nervous about how long the war will continue and what will remain of Yugoslavia when it ends. The Deputy Prime Minister who was discharged on Wednesday, Vuk Draskovic, spoke for many people when he urged a settlement, saying: **********''People who lead this country must say clearly where we stand. They must say what will be left of Serbia in 20 days if the bombing continues.'' **********But few here said Mr. Milosevic would feel significant pressure from executives to stop the war, because their positions depend on his. In a statement, Group 17 criticized NATO for punishing the entire nation, and not just Mr. Milosevic. The economists said destroying the civilian economy ''causes no material and even political damage to Mr. Milosevic, but only to the citizens of Yugoslavia.'' **********After the war, Professor Dinkic said, Yugoslavia will depend on imported oil and gasoline and will be unable to rebuild its industrial sector, let alone its bridges, without significant aid from the very countries of the advanced West that are now bombing it, Mr. Dinkic said. **********If the war ends with a clear NATO victory, international aid and investment will be vital for any recovery. But foreign investors will not be very likely to invest much money in a country without functioning road and rail networks, a European diplomat who specializes in economics said. **********''The roads and bridges have to come first,'' the diplomat said. But he noted that with ruined factories like 14 Oktobar, even the capacity to produce the equipment required to rebuild bridges, airports and roads has gone."

The political upheaval that vaulted him to power originated from an economic crisis. While the political drama may be over, the economic crisis rages on. **********Mark Baird, the World Bank's representative in Jakarta, likens Indonesia to a drowning swimmer who has broken the surface after a fierce struggle. ''Now they've got to swim 10 miles to shore,'' he said. **********Indonesia's economy is still the sickest in Asia, with its banks and many of its companies paralyzed by debt. Modest growth has returned, but not enough to offset the devastating effects of the recession. Inflation and interest rates have returned to earth, though few banks have any money to lend. **********Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, rose to its highest level today since last summer. But at an exchange rate of 6,800 rupiah to the dollar, it is still worth only a third of what it was before the financial crisis. **********Perhaps most disturbing to Mr. Wahid, some 20 million people have slipped under the poverty line since the crisis began two years ago, according to the World Bank. This crippling loss of wealth has left almost one-fifth of Indonesia's 200 million people living in poverty. **********''His principal economic agenda has to be domestic,'' said Eugene K. Galbraith, an economist and expert on Indonesia. ''He must sew the place together after it was rent apart over the last two years.'' **********For now Mr. Wahid, 59, has tried to allay fears that he would depart from the policies of his predecessor, B. J. Habibie. In a speech Wednesday, he pledged his fealty to open markets and the need to make Indonesia competitive. Those statements seemed aimed at the investors, and if the robust performance of the rupiah has been any guide, they hit home. **********As a practical matter, economic analysts note, Mr. Wahid has little room for maneuver. Indonesia cannot do without the $43 billion rescue package assembled by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other agencies in 1997. That money comes with strict policy prescriptions. **********''We're still very much in a straitjacket for the next year or two,'' said Umar Juoro, an economic adviser to former President Habibie. ''The new Government will have to be quite careful.'' **********Indeed, the monetary fund and the World Bank recently halted the flow of aid amid suspicions that Jakarta was trying to cover up a bank scandal. The agencies said they may soon resume the aid, following a Supreme Court ruling in Indonesia earlier this week that required the government to release the results of an outside investigation of the scandal. **********''It's not finally resolved, but this was an important step,'' said Hubert Neiss, the director of Asia-Pacific operations of the monetary fund. ''We'd have to see evidence that a legal prosecution is under way.'' **********Mr. Wahid and Ms. Megawati met on Thursday night, just after Ms. Megawati was sworn in as Vice president, to begin drawing up a cabinet. Political analysts said names could be announced on Monday. **********Given his ecumenical style, experts believe that in addition to senior officials from his own party, Mr. Wahid is likely to draw some from Ms. Megawati's party and even from Golkar, the party of Suharto and Mr. Habibie, whose patrimonial rule was abruptly terminated by the Parliament this week. **********The choice of cabinet ministers will be particularly crucial because neither Mr. Wahid nor Ms. Megawati has the aptitude or interest to delve into the nitty-gritty of policy making. **********''Both of them are essentially symbolic leaders,'' said Rizal Ramli, an economist. ''They will need a proactive cabinet to compensate.'' **********How proactive remains to be seen. Some expect Ms. Megawati's chief economic adviser, Kwik Kian Gie, to assume a senior post like finance minister. Mr. Kwik, an outspoken ethnic Chinese economist, ruffled feathers earlier this year when he suggested that Indonesia should peg the value of the rupiah to the dollar, a policy that is anathema to the monetary fund. **********Others predicted that Mr. Kwik's views would disqualify him. Indeed, in some political betting parlors yesterday, Fuad Bawazir, a Finance Minister under Mr. Suharto, was being mentioned as a possible finance minister in the new Government. **********Mr. Neiss said Mr. Wahid had expressed his support for the fund's program in a meeting with some of its top officials. Mr. Wahid has a few pet projects, like increased aid to farmers, that go beyond the existing program. But Mr. Neiss said they could be accommodated without ripping up the agreement. **********Agricultural policy is a nettlesome issue in Indonesia. Last year, the devaluation of the rupiah and a damaged distribution system caused a shortage in rice, Indonesia's staple. Skyrocketing prices led to food riots in eastern Java. While Indonesia has adequate stores of rice this year, economic analysts said Mr. Wahid was keenly aware of the danger posed by any future shortages. **********Given Indonesia's perilous finances, Mr. Wahid will not be in a position to hand out much. Under the International Monetary Fund's program, Indonesia now aims at a budget deficit no higher than 5.8 percent of its gross domestic product. But economists warn that this number will swell as the Government spends tens of billions to bail out its debt-ridden banks and corporations. **********''This is going to be their biggest headache,'' said Mari Pangestu, an economist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta. ''They've got to reduce expenditures, including some sensitive ones, like fuel subsidies.'' **********The last time Indonesia cut fuel subsidies, in May 1998, fierce riots forced the resignation of Mr. Suharto. **********Yet there has been remarkably little doomsaying in Jakarta this week -- because the elections of Mr. Wahid and Ms. Megawati produced something more precious than gold in Indonesia: a sense of stability. **********''This is the first time you've had a Government in Indonesia with such a broad base of support,'' Mr. Baird of the World Bank said. **********Stability is crucial to Indonesia both at home and abroad. Domestically, it will reassure business people, not least the ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs who spirited billions of dollars out of the country after anti-Chinese riots last year. Elsewhere, it will lure investors back in. **********It was two years ago this month that Mr. Suharto appealed to the International Monetary Fund to rescue Indonesia's hemorrhaging economy. Indonesians hope that Mr. Suharto's humbling plea and Mr. Wahid's proud ascension will come to be seen as bookends in their country's turbulent journey. **********''Let's hope they select a team that can manage the economy,'' Ms. Pangestu said. ''But let's start with law and order -- and peace on the streets.''"

Ford Motor, in an unusual stunt, is buying an estimated $10 million of commercial time on dozens of national and pan-regional TV networks -- 40 broadcast and cable channels in America alone -- to run a single, two-minute spot. **********It is believed to be the most widespread use of one commercial at one time by a giant advertiser, which will also include showing the spot on two Web sites, www.ford.com and www.broadcast.com. **********Ford's ambitious effort to present the commercial to millions of people at the same hour -- known in industry parlance as a roadblock -- is emblematic of the extraordinary steps being taken by major marketers to stand out in a cacophonous, cluttered media landscape. **********''One of the beauties of television is its massive, immediate reach,'' said Jon Mandel, co-managing director of Mediacom in New York, an agency owned by Grey Advertising that buys commercial time and advertising space for marketers like Hasbro, Mars, Oracle and Reebok. **********''But because there's now a gazillion channels to watch, reach declines further and further,'' he added. ''I'd call what Ford is doing pretty big.'' **********The emotional commercial is intended to help welcome the millennium and celebrate Ford customers for their diversity. Viewers will hear Charlotte Church, a 13-year-old soprano, sing an uplifting tune, ''Just Wave Hello,'' as they watch footage filmed in nine countries. There are scenes of people of various races and nationalities engaged in everyday activities: arguing with a lover, exercising, bidding a friend goodbye, sightseeing, dancing, working and, of course, watching TV. **********To be sure, all that loving, leaving and living -- presented in an upbeat manner reminiscent of ''It's A Small World'' or ''We Are the World'' -- takes place in the presence of Fords, vintage and contemporary. They represent the seven brands the company makes from Aston Martin to Volvo and include a Model T, pickups, a sleek Lincoln, buses, a Jaguar XK8, a 1999 Ford Mustang and a 2000 Ford Focus. **********Though the spot is the first to include all the Ford brands, its purpose is less about selling cars and trucks than it is about burnishing  Ford's image. The goal: generate warm and fuzzy feelings about Ford as part of the mission of Jacques A. Nasser, the new chief executive, to have consumers perceive Ford as the world's leading company for auto products and services. **********''We would like to think our customers and prospective customers would trust the Ford Motor Company,'' said Jim Schroer, vice president for global marketing at Ford, ''but you can't trust anybody unless you know who they are.'' **********He added: ''People know what Ford is, a big automobile manufacturer, but they don't know who Ford is. They don't know we're a company with heart, soul, a passion for their lives.'' **********Mr. Schroer discussed the global roadblock in a phone interview in advance of a news conference, scheduled for this afternoon in midtown Manhattan. He predicted that the commercial would ''reach a billion people, 300 million households, in one night.'' **********Mr. Schroer and other executives plan to disclose details about the commercial, which was created by a longtime Ford advertising agency, the Detroit office of J. Walter Thompson, a unit of WPP Group that handles assignments including the Ford division. **********''It was a mammoth task to pull it all together,'' said Ted Powell, international creative director on the Ford account at Thompson Detroit. ''We've been working on it for 10 months, getting all the countries, all the satellite stations on board.'' **********''All our research points to this being a world first,'' he added, ''though somebody may come out of the woodwork claiming otherwise.'' **********Thompson Detroit is being assisted by other Ford agencies, Mr. Powell said, like Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, also part of WPP, and Young & Rubicam Advertising. The media buying is being done by Ford Motor Media and Mindshare, a joint venture of Thompson and Ogilvy. **********Here is how the global roadblock will work. The commercial will begin running in New Zealand on the Internet, then head west around the world -- ''following the sun just like the new millennium will,'' as Mr. Schroer put it. The schedule calls for the spot to run at around 9 P.M. in each country or region. **********Pan-regional networks that will carry the commercial overseas include CNN International, Discovery, Eurosport and MTV; networks in individual countries include ITV (Britain), TF1 (France), RAI1 (Italy) and RTL (Germany). **********In this country, the spot is to run on these broadcast networks: ABC, CBS, Fox Broadcasting, NBC, Pax and WB. It will also be seen on cable networks including A&E, Animal Planet, BET, Bravo, CNN, Comedy Central, Discovery, E Entertainment Television, ESPN, FX, the History Channel, Lifetime, MSNBC, Nick at Nite, the Sci-Fi Channel, TBS, TNT, TNN, Univision, VH1 and the Weather Channel. **********The commercial is to run without a narration or voice-over announcer. Ms. Church will be heard singing the song -- commissioned by Ford and planned as the first track on her coming CD -- only in English. Carolyn Brown, a spokeswoman for Ford, attributed that to English being ''the universal language'' as well as ''the language of our home base.'' **********The global roadblock is the most recent in a series of unique television events involving Ford. **********In June 1953, ''The Ford 50th Anniversary Show'' ran simultaneously on CBS and NBC; the variety tribute featured stars like Mary Martin, Ethel Merman and Frank Sinatra. The movie ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its television debut in November 1956 as part of ''Ford Star Jubilee,'' a series of lavish monthly specials. **********In June 1997, Ford was the sole sponsor of ''Schindler's List,'' which NBC ran without commercial interruptions. And the Ford Focus is being introduced with a skein of live spots by Thompson Detroit, which began last month at the MTV Video Music Awards; those spots are being modified to be less scripted and more spontaneous. **********If an advertiser ''is saying something new and different and wants everyone to know it,'' Mr. Mandel of Mediacom said, expensive and extensive stunts like a global roadblock make sense. **********''But if it's just done for the ego,'' he added, ''save your money.'' **********An anthemic commercial running around the world has another purpose, Mr. Mandel said: ''cheerleading to yourselves,'' promoting the company to its own employees, suppliers and dealers. **********Mr. Schroer of Ford said: ''We call it our 'Global Anthem.' We're proud of our track record in the millennium we're leaving, and we're waving hello to a new millennium, a new generation.'' **********In other words, think of the commercial as the modern manifestation of the old ad slogan, ''There's a Ford in your future.''"

Rubin outlined a modest five-point American plan today for warding off the kind of financial crisis that rocked three continents over the last two years. He called for strengthened financial disclosure rules and guidelines that would ''discourage countries from taking too many risks'' when they borrow money. **********But Mr. Rubin's proposals, which President Clinton endorsed in a brief talk at the White House on Tuesday, fell well short of creating the kind of new ''global financial architecture'' that many policy makers debated in the heat of the crisis in emerging markets last fall. His ideas were chiefly modifications of existing rules, more akin to rewiring a building than reconstructing it. **********At no time in his speech here today before the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies did Mr. Rubin repeat President Clinton's frequent statement last fall that the world was facing its ''deepest economic crisis in 50 years.'' In fact, many American and European officials fear that as Asia's immediate crisis and the threat of economic contagion have receded, the political momentum for far-reaching reforms may have been lost. **********Mr. Clinton warned on Tuesday about the dangers of complacency and the Treasury chief said today that he was concerned that in financial markets ''even painful lessons recede from memory with time.'' **********Nonetheless, the proposals Mr. Rubin put forward were infused with his characteristic caution about either overregulating markets or expanding the powers of the International Monetary Fund in ways that would signal investors they could count on being saved if a nation appeared on the brink of default. The I.M.F. -- which meets along with the World Bank and the Group of Seven finance ministers early next week -- has been the prime instrument for bailing out ailing nations. **********The Secretary made no mention today of turning the I.M.F. into a ''lender of last resort'' for nations on the brink of bankruptcy, a proposal that some top officials of the fund have floated in recent months. ''There was a range of views on that within the Treasury,'' Mr. Rubin acknowledged in response to a question. But he had opposed the idea, his aides say, fearing that if countries knew that the I.M.F. stood ready to prevent defaults, they would resume the kind of reckless lending that helped Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Brazil get into trouble. **********Similarly, he rejected the imposition of any kind of capital controls, rules that would limit the amount of money countries borrow, and, in times of crisis, prevent investors from pulling their money out. Such regulations, he said, ''can be used by politicians as a substitute for real reform of their economies.'' **********Instead Mr. Rubin focused on five areas of reform, some of which are already under way: forcing lenders to pay a greater share of the cost of bailing out nations, discouraging most countries from using fixed exchange rates, encouraging nations to rely more on long-term borrowing and less on short-term, disclosing more information about outstanding debt, and protecting the poor and middle class during crises. **********The first initiative arises from the sharp criticism directed at both the United States and the I.M.F. that they bailed out banks and bondholders in Asia by insuring that they were repaid, but did far less for workers who lost their jobs. **********Mr. Rubin said today that ''market discipline will work only if creditors bear the consequences of the risks they take.'' He suggested that in future bailouts, the bankers and investors who lent money to a country would have to ''share the burden.'' But he did not say how, and acknowledged that if the rules were too harsh, lenders would steer clear of developing nations. **********He was clearer about exchange rates. ''At the center of each recent crisis,'' Mr. Rubin said, ''has been a rigid exchange-rate regime that proved ultimately unsustainable,'' a reference to the efforts by many Asian nations and Russia to peg their currencies to the dollar. He argued that the I.M.F. and individual nations should no provide money to help a country defend a fixed exchange rate, except in rare circumstances. **********Mr. Rubin cautioned countries like Argentina that are considering adopting the dollar as their currency, a step many nations see as a way to bring stability to their economies. He said they would be giving up virtually all domestic control over monetary policy, which would be set by the Federal Reserve. And he warned that the Fed would manage the dollar to fit American economic interests -- and no one else's. It would not help supervise foreign banks, he said, or change interest-rate policy to fit another country's needs simply because it had adopted the dollar. **********Mr. Rubin was particularly careful in dealing with the question of how to manage the $1.5 trillion that races around the globe each day in currency transactions, purchases and investments. Saying governments ''must do a better job of managing their own debt,'' he warned them against borrowing too much short-term cash, rather than paying more for long-term borrowing. Many nations found that, once their currencies were devalued, they could not meet the short-term debt payments. **********Mr. Rubin said that in some cases rules should be adopted to ''limit banks' foreign currency exposures.'' But he did not describe those rules. And while he warned nations against excessive borrowing, he said the best way to deal with the problem was to require countries, banks, securities houses and hedge funds to disclose more data about how much debt they are carrying. **********He suggested that Mr. Clinton's Working Group on Financial Markets, which he helps direct, would soon recommend tighter disclosure rules for hedge funds like Long-Term Capital Management, which had to be saved last fall from a multibillion-dollar default. Investigations showed the lenders to Long-Term Capital did not understand how much money the fund had quietly borrowed."

But don't waste time trying to tell those purported dinosaurs about their impending doom: They're too busy counting the money pouring in from, of all places, the very companies that are supposedly going to put them out of business. **********The rush among Internet companies to promote their brands to computer users is turning into a gold rush for television, radio, newspapers, magazines and outdoor advertising, not to mention the mainstay Madison Avenue agencies. **********''The economy is strong and advertising is good anyway,'' said Stephen B. Shepard, editor in chief of Business Week magazine in New York, published by the McGraw-Hill Companies. ''But because of technology and E-commerce, we're blowing the doors off.'' **********''Our summer issues are like April or October fat,'' he added. ''There are tons of ads from companies you didn't know a few months ago -- and in some cases, you hadn't heard of till you see the ad.'' **********How robust is the growth for the traditional media from the on-line media? While spending among all advertisers in traditional media in the first quarter of 1999 rose 4.6 percent from figures in the period a year earlier -- according to Competitive Media Reporting, a research unit of VNU N.V. -- the largest gain by far came in the category of new media: up 183.1 percent, to $284.2 million from $100.4 million. **********''It's just like when the medium of TV got turned on, and ad budgets escalated geometrically,'' said Jonathan Bond, co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, an agency that works for cyberspace clients like the DLJ Direct on-line brokerage firm and Theglobe.com at its New York and San Francisco offices. **********''It's a race,'' Mr. Bond said. ''The first one to become a brand wins.'' **********To become a brand, a product must gain awareness among consumers. But the new media still lag behind the traditional media in how many consumers they reach; for instance, about 37 million households have Internet access while about 100 million have TV sets. **********''Especially for businesses that are trying to target people who are on the fence about going on line, the traditional media are obviously the best place to reach an audience not quite there yet,'' said Patrick Keane, director for on-line advertising strategies at the consulting company Jupiter Communications in New York. **********So in addition to the hefty sums spent by the new media in the new media to advertise themselves, they must also turn to the old media, at least for the moment, to reach mass audiences to advertise their wares. **********''Right now, it's a feeding frenzy,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the industry trade association in New York. **********''It's ironic that all the 'dot coms' are using off-line media to attract people to their sites,'' he added. ''But you cannot do on the Net what you can do in a 30-second television commercial or a strong newspaper ad.'' **********Indeed, newspapers are scrambling to keep up with the additional demand for ad space. **********''The one word I would use is explosive,'' said Jyll F. Holzman, senior vice president for advertising at The New York Times. ''It's triple-digit growth.'' **********''An account that wanted to spend $2 million in eight weeks came in yesterday,'' she added, ''and it was 35 minutes from 'We're interested' to 'We'll commit.' That does not happen every day.'' **********The Times plans to run a special news section about E-commerce on Sept. 22, Ms. Holzman said, and ''it could have the most advertising of any special section ever to appear in our pages.'' **********The sibling print medium of magazines is reporting similar strength. For the first six months of 1999, new- media companies spent $111.5 million to advertise in magazines. That was 154 percent above the $44 million spent in the period a year earlier -- and almost as much as the $117 million spent during all of 1998. **********''The reports of our demise are premature,'' said Chris Miller, executive vice president for marketing at the Magazine Publishers of America, the trade association. **********''Nobody is going to kill anybody,'' she added. ''The media are all being married to each other.'' **********Even the most prosaic media are benefiting. **********''If you sit on the beach as I did last weekend,'' said F. Stone Roberts, co-chairman and chief executive at Gotham Inc. in New York, an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies that handles cyberclients like America Online and WebMD, ''half the banners you see planes towing are for 'dot com' businesses.'' **********''They had a little something different in mind when they used to talk about 'banner ads,' '' he added. **********Another form of outdoor advertising, billboards, is also thriving, particularly in what Tom Bedecarre, chairman at Citron Haligman Bedecarre/Euro RSCG in San Francisco, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, described as ''the top wired markets.'' Those are cities like Boston, Denver and San Francisco in addition to the giants like Los Angeles and New York. **********''Billboards along Highway 101 near the San Francisco airport and in Silicon Valley go for $15,000 to $25,000 a month,'' said Neil Cohen, senior vice president for business affairs at Adauction.com in San Francisco. Last week, his company auctioned several sites for an average of 35 percent more than the already high prevailing prices. **********''We started in remnant, distressed media,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''But an auction also works when something is scarce, in demand.'' **********The demand in traditional media is keeping traditional agencies busy. **********''We must get five calls a day saying, 'We've got $2 million to spend and we like your E*Trade advertising,' '' said Rich Silverstein, co-chairman and creative director at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco. ''I can't even keep track of it.'' **********''The reason they seem to need us is that we have to give them a brand, a soul,'' said Mr. Silverstein, whose agency, a unit of Omnicom Group, recently landed big ''dot com'' accounts like E*Trade, the on-line brokerage firm, and Ebay, the auction Web site. ''There isn't a lot of soul on the Internet.'' **********San Francisco is a hotbed of account activity because of its proximity to Silicon Valley. **********''We went from no 'dot com' accounts to five in the last six months,'' said Mr. Bedecarre, referring to new clients like Cnet and Women.com. ''And it will be six tomorrow; we were just hired by someone else.'' **********''We love working with these clients,'' he added, ''because there's a greater conviction in the on-line world that advertising works than in the off-line world.'' **********That feeling is fueled by cash raised in initial public offerings and from venture capitalists, who encourage ad spending to build businesses and market valuations by building brands. **********''In the old days, ad spending was funded by profits,'' Mr. Bond said, ''and no profits meant no ad spending. But now there's a paradigm shift. It's O.K. to spend money on advertising without profits; your financial strategy and your marketing strategy are intertwined.'' **********Still, Madison Avenue is less than exuberant about all the new new-media work. **********''This is the time you have to be very careful,'' Mr. Silverstein said. ''Not all these companies are going to make it.'' **********''Tell me where is Tucker, Hudson, Studebaker?'' he asked, referring to defunct car brands. ''It all sorted out to the Big Three.'' **********Mr. Bond agreed. **********''It's all risky,'' Mr. Bond said. ''I'm not bragging about our Internet assignments.'' **********''I'll be honest with you,'' he added. ''I've got to find some boring old bricks-and-mortar clients.''"

Now,...",2411,,International Herald Tribune,Business Day,,article,Kuala Lumpur May Force Investors to Sell at a Loss : Cash Offer for Frozen Shares,Kuala Lumpur May Force Investors to Sell at a Loss : Cash Offer for Frozen Shares," **********When Malaysia shocked foreign investors by imposing currency controls in September, some 170,000 Singapore-based investors were stung by the news that Kuala Lumpur would no longer recognize offshore trading in the Malaysian shares they held. **********Now, after months of recrimination and wrangling over the issue, a Malaysian company with close links to powerful government and corporate figures has made an offer to buy all the frozen shares, worth 10.5 billion ringgit ($2.8 billion), for a price that values them at about 50 percent, on average, of their closing prices Friday. **********The offer by Effective Capital Sdn. late Friday has further infuriated many of the investors in Singapore's defunct market for Malaysian shares, known as Clob International. **********The Stock Exchange of Singapore, which runs the authorized nominee company for the Clob shares, said it was studying the plan and would make a statement Monday. It is expected to criticize the offer as being unfair to holders of the Clob securities and insist that they be transferred to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange for trading there. **********Some analysts said Sunday that the Malaysian government was likely to use the uproar over the heavily discounted cash offer by Effective Capital as an opportunity to step in with a somewhat better offer of its own that would involve setting up a closed-end fund to buy the shares at a lesser discount, probably about 25 percent. **********The analysts said such a move would give the government management control or substantial leverage over 17 Malaysian companies, with interests spanning property development, finance, engineering and manufacturing. The Clob shares account for equity stakes in these firms ranging from a maximum of 61 percent to a minimum of 13 percent. **********This would enable the government of Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad to hasten plans for corporate restructuring and consolidation. **********It would also be consistent with the currency controls put in place in September by Kuala Lumpur. They were designed to ensure that all Malaysian shares were traded locally, not offshore, and to prevent speculative trading in the ringgit. **********After the September controls, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange outlined a plan to transfer the shares to Malaysia for trading. Analysts said the government vetoed the plan because it feared that the sudden release of the shares could cause a major sell-off in the Malaysian market."

But what about bidding for seats in business school courses? **********Students at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business are in the throes of such an auction this week. Students registering for elective courses log on to Wharton's course-auction Web site and bid on the ones they want. (Students sign up for core courses through the traditional registration system.) **********Each student starts with 5,000 points. An eager marketing major might place 2,000 points on a course offered by a popular marketing guru, for example, and bid 500 points each on four others. At the end of the day, computers run the numbers and match the highest bidders with the number of open seats. The seats are sold for the ''clearing price,'' the highest losing bid. ''It really puts you in charge,'' said Karin Magnuson, a second-year Wharton student. **********Other business schools have built similar systems. But Wharton's course auction adds a twist: The school runs 10 rounds of auctions each semester. After the second round, it allows students to ''sell'' courses as well as bid on them.  The result is a frenzy of speculation. After all, these are people who have come to business school to learn how to outsmart the markets or, at the very least, turn a quick buck. At semester's end, every student receives a replenishment of 1,000 points for each course completed. But students who want a bigger stash down the road buy courses with the intent of selling them at a higher price. **********Ms. Magnuson, for example, was selling a marketing course for 3,200 points on Wednesday. She insisted that she was not trying to exploit her classmates. ''I'm just trying to prepare for next semester,'' she said. **********Anjani Jain, deputy vice-dean and director of the M.B.A. program, designed the auction almost three years ago. His plan was to mimic a free market. Students cannot buy multiple seats in one class, but they are allowed to purchase seats in an unlimited number of classes, in the same time slots if they want. **********Students cannot see minute-to-minute market data, however. They can only see what price the courses demanded in the last round, put in their bids for the current round and wait until the round ends to see whether they were outbid. ''We want our students to be in the classroom instead of watching a ticker tape,'' Dr. Jain said. **********Still, many students spend much of their first few weeks watching -- and at times cursing -- the auction. Statistics from previous auctions show that by the sixth and seventh rounds, prices soar as students worry about missing out on the courses they want. Last spring, the average seat price climbed from 423 points in the first round to 1,090 points in the seventh. The bubble popped by the 10th round when the average seat price bottomed out at 172 points. **********Meanwhile, skilled bidders have not only learned about the vagaries of supply and demand, Dr. Jain said. They have first-hand experience of on-line auctions to take with them into the world of electronic commerce. ''It has actually spawned some ideas,'' he said, ''about Internet-based commerce using auctions.''   LISA GUERNSEY"

Some said it was a mistake to pull the entire mission out of Kosovo. **********''They should have kept a small core,'' said one senior officer. He pointed out that the United Nations kept a small contingent of peacekeepers in Lebanon and other dangerous places. **********''However bad it gets, our job was inside Kosovo,'' he said. Like many of his colleagues, he said NATO ground forces should now go in to halt the Serbian onslaught described by refugees and Western officials. **********For many, the frustration was heightened by a sense of guilt over the fates of 1,500 local staff members left behind, some of whom may have been shot to death for having associated with the verification mission. **********''We knew it was going to be bad, and I warned our local staff that things would get worse, but I did not think it would be this bad,'' said William Walker, the American diplomat who heads the mission. **********Though it was Mr. Walker who argued at the time of the evacuation that the monitoring mission had been rendered ineffective by Serbian violations, an aide said he had pushed to delay the withdrawal. **********The verifiers were dispatched to Kosovo to monitor a cease-fire, part of the agreement reached last October between the American envoy Richard C. Holbrooke and Mr. Milosevic. The mission was evacuated when the agreement collapsed and NATO prepared to start bombing. **********But for now, there was nothing for the verifiers, most of them soldiers from the United States, Europe, Russia and other countries in the 54-member European security organization, to do but admire the lakeside view and its backdrop of snow-dusted mountains. Their bright orange cars stood parked outside the two best hotels on the shore. Inside, hundreds of foreigners milled around the bars and lobbies. **********The verifiers agreed that the cease-fire they were sent to monitor never really took hold. As one British Army officer described it: ''There never was a cease-fire. We were fighting to keep the lid on, to stop the pot boiling over, while the politicians fiddled around.'' **********But the four months after the cease-fire agreement was reached may have been the calmest months Kosovo had enjoyed in more than a year, despite constant violations of the truce. **********The evacuation of the monitors from Kosovo freed the Yugoslav Army and the Serbian police to unleash an attack on the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, and on the civilian population. **********Mr. Walker looks weary these days. Two of his personal guards in the capital of Kosovo, Pristina, have been reported killed, and their deaths may have resulted from their connection with him and the verification mission. One was his driver and personal assistant, and the other was a local schoolteacher. Both men were married with children. **********Some 20 former employees of the European security organization are missing and have failed to keep in touch with friends and colleagues, said one of the foreign verifiers who is tracking the situation. **********''We are concerned about them,'' he said. ''There are worrying reports. One guard we know has been killed.'' That guard, the son of Bajram Kelmendi, a Pristina human rights lawyer, was abducted and killed along with his father and brother on the first night of the NATO bombing. **********His death is not thought to be connected to his work with the monitors, but rather his father's prominence. Yet there are ominous signs that anyone who was connected with the monitors or other foreigners have been targeted by Serbian paramilitary units. One of the former security guards reported that a contact in the Serbian police had told him, ''If you have any association with the O.S.C.E., you are shot on the spot.'' **********Shops and restaurants frequented by foreigners in Pristina have been looted and burned, and the owner of one popular restaurant, the Monaco, was killed. **********Some of the monitors' former workers have made it safely out of Kosovo. And several interpreters who worked for international aid organizations in Kosovo crossed into Macedonia today. The Serbian police beat them at a checkpoint, they said, and tore the passport of one of them, but allowed them to pass. Although safely out of Kosovo, they still insisted on remaining anonymous. **********Many in the verification mission expressed feelings of shame at abandoning the local staff. ''Everyone is feeling guilty,'' said one senior officer, ''and the ones who became involved with their translator are feeling particularly guilty.'' **********The former spokeswoman for the mission, Beatrice Lacoste, said, ''It was like abandoning patients in a hospital.'' Local workers in the press office told her that they knew they would be targeted by the Serbs if the monitors left Kosovo, she said. **********At the time the decision to evacuate the mission was made, Mr. Walker said the departure was necessary because the monitors were becoming less and less effective. Serbian forces were violating the October agreements more and more blatantly and were preventing the monitors from doing their work, he said. **********An aide of his said: ''We knew we were in trouble when freedom of movement stopped. Our people were threatened with weapons by the M.U.P.'' -- the Serbian police -- ''and the V.J.'' -- the Yugoslav Army. **********''The real threat was the armed civilians,'' the aide said. ''Someone was going to get killed, and we were sitting handcuffed. We felt we were being defeated, we were becoming completely ineffectual.'' **********When the evacuation was decided on, Mr. Walker said in an interview that his monitors were not prepared to sit in Kosovo and watch Mr. Milosevic slowly wipe out the villages. **********''With what is happening, he could take all summer, but he will wipe out the villages,'' Mr. Walker said at the time. ''And all we could say was that at least we stayed to the end. No, we are not going to do that.'' **********But one aide said Mr. Walker had tried to keep the monitors in place as long as he could. **********Now, outside two hotels on the lake shore, the fleet of bright orange cars stood idle. A dozen white cars and truck carrying the emblem of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees were parked at one hotel, the Bellevue. **********No one seemed to know why, during what NATO officials have described as the most alarming refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, the aid trucks were not in use. ''Bureaucracy, I suppose, or a scam,'' said one staff member of the European security organization. **********The evacuation from Kosovo last week was the death knell for the organization's Kosovo Verification Mission. People were boarding buses today to return to their home countries. The staff of 1,400 was being reduced to a core of 250 people, Mr. Walker said. In theory the mission is on standby to return and help with the reconstruction and democratization of Kosovo once a peace settlement is in place. **********In reality, senior officers admit that the mission will not be going back for weeks, if at all. ''It is up to NATO now,'' one said."

A Vodafone Airtouch spokesman said his company would not comment. **********Such a pact might have seemed unthinkable early this year, after Vodafone Group, Britain's largest wireless carrier, snatched Airtouch Communications, the largest United States cellular company, from Bell Atlantic's embrace in a two-week bidding war that Vodafone won with a $60 billion offer. Vodafone Airtouch, as the combined companies became known, emerged as the world's largest cellular telephone company. **********A better outcome, many analysts said at the time, would have been for Vodafone and Bell Atlantic to have split the spoils. Bell Atlantic, the largest land-line local telephone company in the United States and a wireless player on the East Coast, should have bought Airtouch's American wireless properties, those analysts said, with Vodafone Group taking Airtouch's international wireless operations. **********The critics' logic was that Bell Atlantic, with 14 million cellular customers, could take better advantage of the expanded national cellular footprint that Airtouch's 9.5 million United States subscribers would give it, while Vodafone might be better off concentrating on folding Airtouch's holdings in Europe into its own extensive European network. **********And now Vodafone Airtouch and Bell Atlantic, the heated bidding fury having given way to cooler reflection, have apparently concluded that those analysts were right. **********For Bell Atlantic, a joint venture with Vodafone Airtouch would give it the national cellular footprint it has craved for several years. And Vodafone Airtouch would get an expanded American presence to rival the national wireless networks of AT&T and Sprint. Vodafone Airtouch and Bell Atlantic customers would have the advantage of a coast-to-coast network, while consumers generally might benefit from the downward pressure on prices that presumably would result from greater competition. **********''This combination becomes the most credible national wireless play,'' said Richard Klugman, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. ''This all fits and very well and makes sense.'' **********When Ivan G. Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief executive, lost the Airtouch bidding in January, people close to him said he was outraged -- frustrated in part because Bell Atlantic's respectable but not stellar stock performance made it hard to engage in a bidding war with Vodafone, which as a fast-growing upstart had a high-flying stock to use as currency in the Airtouch deal. **********Mr. Seidenberg, a self-starter whose first job in the telecommunications industry was as a 19-year-old assistant telephone repairman for New York Telephone, has aspirations of building a wireless communications empire to rival both AT&T and Sprint. His announcement in the summer of 1998 of a $53 billion acquisition of GTE by Bell Atlantic, a deal that is still pending, was a step in that direction. His next move, which began late last year, was his thwarted pursuit of Airtouch. **********Even after Vodafone won the bidding battle, its chief executive, Chris Gent, said publicly that he still hoped to form some sort partnership with Bell Atlantic. And people close to the current talks say that he and Mr. Seidenberg began discussing a joint venture in July. **********Bell Atlantic and Airtouch had been partners in a joint venture called Primeco Personal Communications, which was formed in 1994 to bid on wireless licenses in metropolitan markets in the United States that neither company yet served. **********But after Airtouch became part of Vodafone, the Primeco relationship became strained, and in April Bell Atlantic dissolved the venture, leaving the partners to divide its holdings. That left Vodafone Airtouch without a cellular presence in the Eastern United States and Bell Atlantic seemingly even farther away  from its goal of building a national cellular network. **********One key player in breaking the impasse, according to people close to the current talks, has been Bell Atlantic's chief financial officer, Frederic V. Salerno. He has known Mr. Gent since the days that Mr. Salerno oversaw the international and wireless operations of the Nynex Corporation, before it was acquired by Bell Atlantic in 1997. Mr. Salerno ''always thought that it made sense'' to combine Vodafone's United States wireless operations with Bell Atlantic's, a person close to the talks said. ''He took losing Airtouch to Vodafone less personally than Ivan.'' **********Another critical diplomatic role was played by Sam Ginn, the chairman of Vodafone Airtouch, who last winter had initially favored an acquisition by Bell Atlantic, but finally elected to go with the highest bid.  People close to the talks said Mr. Ginn had encouraged Mr. Seidenberg to begin talking with Mr. Gent in July. **********Mr. Seidenberg has acknowledged that combining the United States cellular operations is a logical idea, said people close to the discussions, with one caveat: that Bell Atlantic retain control of the operations. **********People close to the talks said negotiations heated up about 10 days ago, with advisers meeting in New York  soon after Vodafone and Bell Atlantic formally split the Primeco assets. Vodafone agreed that Bell Atlantic would own about 55 percent of the combined company and Vodafone would own the rest -- with the right to sell its stake back to Bell Atlantic over the next several years. **********Mr. Gent has agreed, these people say, is that Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Bell Atlantic's president and chief operating officer, would oversee the joint venture. And it is possible the two companies could spin off the venture to the public in the future."

A simple majority was required for passage. **********''While this is a great contract, our work is far from done,'' said Bill Johnson, the president of the Seattle-area local that represents 31,000 Boeing workers. ''We need to work hard on behalf of our members to enforce this contract and continue to protect the jobs of our members.'' Workers in Spokane, Wash.; Wichita, Kan., and Portland, Ore., also participated in the vote. **********The union's leadership had strongly endorsed the proposed contract, which Boeing put forward early Saturday morning after nearly two weeks of intense bargaining at a hotel outside Seattle. Mr. Johnson and other union leaders had predicted a strike only a few hours before Boeing submitted its final offer, which included concessions to the union. **********But an opposition faction within the union campaigned against the contract, complaining that it did not secure strong enough guarantees of job security and did not win cost of living increases for retirees. In 1995, Mr. Johnson endorsed a proposed contract that was later rejected by the membership, extending a strike that eventually lasted 69 days. **********Had two-thirds of the union members voted against the contract, a walkout could have begun as early as today. **********The new contract makes Boeing workers among the best paid in the country, raising their hourly wages nearly 16 percent over three years to an average of $24.35 an hour. The contract also raises retirement benefits 25 percent and contains a one-time 10 percent bonus that amounts to an average of $4,400 per worker. **********In addition, Boeing abandoned an attempt to introduce weekend shifts that would have reduced overtime payments and it failed to get the union to agree to have its members shoulder some of the cost of health insurance. The company agreed not to lay off any workers as a result of a decision to subcontract work to third-party manufacturers, though even the union leaders admitted that the language they agreed to was not as firm as they had hoped. **********Some investors have expressed doubt that the new pact's estimated cost of $600 million will be more than made up for through increased productivity, as Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman, has said. **********But the new agreement does give the company three years to work with the union to raise profits following a production foul-up two years ago that forced it to halt production  of many of its jets resulting in Boeing's first annual loss in 50 years."

That would be possible, of course, if the tag slapped on your bag at check-in was smart enough to follow you through your plane changes. With a new ''smart label'' developed by Motorola, those little paper tags stuck on your suitcase -- and a lot of other labels, as well -- may become a lot more useful. **********Motorola's Worldwide Smartcard Solutions division recently announced its new Bi statix technology, which uses special antennas printed on paper in an identification system based on radio frequencies to track everything from packages to people. Bi statix is still being tested; the first products are expected next fall. Similar radio-frequency technology using conventional antennas is already used for such things as electronic time cards and security passes for employees and for inventory control in warehouses. **********Radio-frequency-identification technology may sound a little scary, but it just means that the label emits radio waves with identifying information and can also receive radio waves that change the information carried by the label. The label itself includes an integrated circuit that works with a special antenna; signals can be sent and received when someone approaches with a radio-frequency scanning device. **********There are already many types of digital scanning devices, like Metrocards, which have a magnetic stripe that, when passed through a scanner, admit the holder through a subway turnstile. But the magnetic stripe, as any New York subway rider can tell you, has to be swiped just so to work. A radio-frequency reader needs to be only close to the tag -- inches or feet away -- to recognize it, and the signal can be read through dirt, wind and rain. **********Unlike a traditional antenna made from a metal wire coil and a capacitor, the Bistatix  antenna is printed on paper in an inexpensive process that uses regular carbon-based ink. There are no rigid metal parts. Since the Bistatix label has both the antenna and the circuit, it can both send signals to a reader device and receive them. **********Since the tag is scanned, yielding information, Bistatix might sound like some sort of fancy new bar code process, but the two technologies are different, said Rich Krueger, director of radio-frequency-identification business development at Motorola. ''In bar code, first of all, it's a read-only technology,'' he explained. ''You can't change the information on it.'' And, he pointed out, a bar code can easily be counterfeited on a photocopier. Also, a bar code can only send information to a computer when it is scanned. A Bistatix label can also receive information, which changes the data encoded into it and can then be used to track an object. **********To scan a bar code, Mr. Krueger said, ''you need what's called a good optical angle.'' Think of all those times you've stood in line at the local grocery while the cashier tries to scan through a can of soda at the wrong angle, and you get the picture. **********''Unless you've got an extremely expensive and complex bar code scanner,'' Mr. Krueger said, ''you have to get alignment to it in order to read it.'' The new Motorola tags, however, can be scanned without any clear line of sight. **********Bistatix tags can carry more information than the average bar code label. ''That silicon can hold about 900 user bits of information, which translates into roughly 112  characters of information,'' he said. Bistatix technology can also be used with bar codes. **********Mr. Krueger said he expected the security industry to be one of the first business sectors to adopt Bistatix products, for security cards controlling access to buildings. **********They are also expected to be useful for tracking packages. The United States Postal Service began testing the Bistatix technology this month. ''For those kind of applications where you have hundreds of thousands of parcels moving on conveyors, we see the Bistatix technology as offering hands-free automatic identification of those parcels,''  Mr. Krueger said. Other possible uses for Bistatix include theme-park passes, which could be programmed to let the holders enter on certain days, and tickets for sports or theater events, which could be encoded to give discounts to season-ticket holders. **********''The other aspect that's unique about Bistatix,'' Mr. Krueger said, ''is that -- as opposed to those rigid antennas -- it's printed on paper, so you can wrap it around objects like bottles and parcels and still access it.'' **********The airline industry is another big potential customer. Three billion pieces of luggage are handled each year by airline personnel. The bar code labels used by many carriers can become scratched, torn and otherwise rendered unreadable in transit, forcing people to route more than 40 percent of the baggage. Lost or delayed luggage costs up to $10 billion a year worldwide over all, according to industry estimates. But bag tags and boarding passes made with Bi statix technology could still be read even if they are folded, scuffed or ripped. **********Mr. Krueger explained how bag tags printed at luggage check-in counters would work: ''As the bag tag goes through the printing mechanism to print the bar code and other information like 'Chicago to San Francisco,' it would be encoding the information into the silicon at the same time. And out the other end would come an electronic label, all in one basic operation.'' **********Since new information can be encoded into fields on the tags, Bistatix boarding passes could track people just as easily as their bags. ''One could reserve selected fields for the original flight information, the intervening airlines that one might transfer to in the course of that trip and then the final destination -- all tied into system locator information,'' Mr. Krueger said. **********That could result in fewer lost suitcases. But don't look for progress any time soon in those in-flight snacks."

Sales rose 61 percent, to $9.42 billion from $5.83 billion, excluding the results of the Digital Equipment Corporation, which Compaq acquired, before June 11, 1998. Compaq said sales rose 17 percent on a pro forma basis. **********Including charges related to the Digital acquisition, Compaq had a net loss of $3.63 billion, or $2.33 a share, in the second quarter of 1998. **********After Compaq warned last month that it would have a substantial loss for the recent quarter, analysts estimated the company would lose 11 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. **********Compaq released its results after the close of the market. Its shares rose 56.25 cents yesterday, to close at $25.9375. Compaq shares have lost half their value this year amid disappointing earnings and management turmoil. **********Compaq has been losing money in the face of the Dell Computer Corporation's more efficient method of selling directly to customers. Compaq is also saddled with the higher development costs of the large computer systems that it acquired with Digital and Tandem Computers Inc. **********In a statement, Michael D. Capellas,  whom Compaq promoted to president and chief executive last week from acting chief operating officer, said, ''We are aggressively taking the appropriate actions to restore the company's growth and financial performance. **********''The realignment of the company is fully under way,'' he added. ''Over all, we expect the realignment to have a positive effect on both gross margin and operating expenses going forward.'' **********The job cuts announced yesterday would bring Compaq's total employment to 59,000. Compaq, which now has 69,000 employees, still has about 2,000 jobs left to cut from an earlier reorganization that was intended to reduce the work force by 20 percent. Compaq has said it will shave $2 billion in annual costs and reorganize its business groups. **********The company said it would take a charge of $700 million to $900 million in the third quarter to cover costs of the reorganization. More details will be released as the company decides which operations are to be closed and which groups to be combined. **********Analysts said the cuts were the kind of aggressive moves that Compaq needed to return to profitability. Compaq's costs are still far too high for the company to be profitable on the relatively thin profit margins of the personal computer industry. And Compaq's efforts to retain its position as the largest PC supplier have required deep discounting that weakens those margins, they added. **********''They basically have the gross margins of a pure PC company, but they've got DEC and Tandem in the mix, which should have higher margins,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. Costs are ''all just a little bit too high; the math doesn't work,'' he said. ''For the next couple of quarters, it just doesn't look too hot for the likelihood of them making money.'' **********Yesterday, Compaq quoted reports by the International Data Corporation showing that it gained 2.2 percentage points in United States PC market share from the 1998 quarter, to 16.6 percent, and that its worldwide PC market share grew to 14.6 percent. But from the first quarter of 1999 to the second, Compaq's share grew by just one-tenth of a percentage point, while Dell's grew by eight-tenths of a percentage point and I.B.M.'s rose by three-tenths of a point, I.D.C. said. **********''At least Capellas seems to understand the magnitude of the problems,'' said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. ''Now they have to execute on solving them. They have to integrate DEC, and please customers, and prioritize on what they're going to fix first.''"

As owner of a medium-sized business, I've been successful in retaining a large percentage of my staff -- except for the techies. In the past year alone, I've had to replace my computer technician four times. Several of my colleagues have experienced similar problems. Why is there such high turnover in this field, and how can I attract and retain good help? **********A. The simple explanation for the turnover rate is supply and demand. Technology workers have the skills, and companies are desperate for them. So, more and more, keeping these employees means keeping them happy. **********Often, that isn't as easy as it sounds. Providing a strong salary and benefits package is only part of the equation, said Laurence Holt, chief executive of Quidnunc, a consulting firm in New York that helps businesses develop E-business strategies. Another important factor is the technology itself: If your company's information systems aren't keeping pace with the changing market, he warned, your employees may feel that they,  too, are at risk of being left behind. **********''Tech people are scared of ending up with a resume that locks them out of the new economy,'' he said. If your company is clinging to outdated programs and systems, ''be aware that you're making a decision that makes it tough to retain people.'' **********Burnout also poses a serious threat to technology workers' happiness, said Shawn Landgraf, chief executive of Network Connections Inc., a high-technology consulting firm in New York. ''It's very difficult for even the most dedicated workers to keep up with the changing technology and day-to-day business activities,'' he said. **********Repetitive work can exacerbate the situation. ''The type of employee who goes into the technology division gets very bored  quickly doing the same tasks over and over,'' Mr. Landgraf said. But many workers, like help-desk operators and PC technicians, end up in such situations, hurting their enthusiasm and efficiency, he added. **********Companies can take steps to ease the stress and monotony. Sometimes even little things can help -- adding minibreaks to work schedules, for example, or giving employees time to go to the health club, Mr. Landgraf said. A work space with lots of windows and bright lighting can make a big difference in morale and productivity, he added. **********Throwing in a few perks can't hurt either.  Quidnunc takes its employees -- now 150 -- on a vacation each year. Last year, the destination was northern Italy. **********''We did a lot of water sports and just hung out. It's a big investment, but we've been repaid several times over,'' Mr. Holt said, noting that Quidnunc's turnover rate is 7 percent, compared with an industry average of 20 percent. **********The bottom line is that you need to start studying your technology strategy not only for how it satisfies business needs, but also for how it satisfies your technology staff. Otherwise, Mr. Holt said, your best option may be to hire an outside firm to do the work."

R. Baron. **********The Bear Stearns clearing unit is the subject of continuing investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office, the United States Attorney for for the Southern District of New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Asked about the testimony, Bear Stearns declined to comment. The company has denied wrongdoing in its clearing business. Sterling Foster and its president, Adam Lieberman, agreed to pay $11.5 million in an S.E.C. settlement last fall without admitting or denying wrongdoing. A spokesman for the United States Attorney has said that office is continuing its investigation of Sterling Foster. In the A. R. Baron case, 14 of the firm's executives were convicted of securities fraud by the office of Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney. In all, public customers of the firm lost $75 million when it failed. **********The new case is being brought against Bear Stearns by Howard Greenberg, a customer of Sterling Foster who lost $500,000 in his dealings with the firm. Mr. Greenberg's complaint was first filed as an arbitration case before the National Association of Securities Dealers. But the N.A.S.D. panel dismissed it on Nov. 20. Mr. Greenberg's lawyer, Leslie Trager, has filed a motion to overturn the arbitration's dismissal in District Court. **********Lawyers in the Greenberg case took testimony from Keith Brigley, who was an associate director at the Bear Stearns Clearing Corporation for seven years until last year. Mr. Brigley reported to Peter Murphy, second in command in the clearing unit, headed by Richard Harriton. **********In his testimony, Mr. Brigley described behind-the-scenes dealings that took place between Bear Stearns and Mr. Lieberman of Sterling Foster surrounding an initial public offering of $7.2 million in common stock and warrants in ML Direct Inc., a marketing concern. **********The offering took place in September 1996. According to court documents, Sterling Foster aggressively sold ML Direct stock to its customers as soon as trading in the new issue began. Sterling Foster sold twice what was offered in the initial public offering. **********This created what is known as a short position in the shares of ML Direct on Sterling Foster's books, since the firm could not come up with enough shares to cover what it had sold in the open market. Such a position could create a huge problem for the firm that clears the stock trades if the share price shoots up and it must buy shares at a higher market price. That firm was Bear Stearns. **********According to Mr. Brigley's testimony, when Mr. Lieberman of Sterling Foster was asked how this potential liability would be covered, he assured Mr. Brigley that an additional 2.3 million shares would be delivered to Bear Stearns from insiders who were selling their own shares of ML Direct stock. In Wall Street parlance, these people are called selling shareholders. **********But page 2 of the ML Direct prospectus stated that selling shareholders had agreed to refrain from selling any shares for 12 months, an arrangement commonly known as a lockup. Bear Stearns's executives had copies of this prospectus. Mr. Brigley says in his testimony that he does not recall reading the lockup provision in the prospectus. **********Mr. Trager, the lawyer in the case, says Bear Stearns executives are held by law to have read the prospectus. ''The evidence showed that as a matter of law and fact, Bear Stearns knew of the material misrepresentation in the prospectus,'' Mr. Trager said. ''For it to clear what they knew was a fraudulent transaction creates a liability against them and it is rather surprising that they would do such a transaction.'' Securities laws broadly state that it is unlawful for any person to employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud. **********What the testimony describes in the ML Direct offering parallels descriptions of five other Sterling Foster offerings that were included in an indictment of Randolph Pace, former owner of the defunct broker Rooney Pace, by the United States Attorney last November. In all those offerings, which were underwritten by Sterling Foster, the United States Attorney contends that insiders had publicly stated that they would lock up their shares. In reality, according to the indictment, the selling shareholders had a secret agreement with the underwriter to sell shares during the initial offering. Mr. Pace has denied wrongdoing in the matter. **********Neither the Manhattan District Attorney nor the United States Attorney would comment on Mr. Brigley's testimony. Rob Khuzami, chief of the securities fraud unit at the United States Attorney's office, said, ''We are continuing our investigation in all of its various aspects.''"

This is the same man who opposed Spain's entry into the organization as a young Socialist opposition politician in the early 1980's. **********''I've never planned my life,'' Mr. Solana, a 56-year-old former Foreign Minister, said with a laugh in his office this week as the allied bombing of Yugoslavia entered its second week. **********''Life, and the wind of life, have taken me places I never thought I'd be,'' he mused, in fluent if sometimes heavily accented English. ''Look at me: I'm a theoretical physicist!'' he said, to prove the point. **********He looks the part, dressing casually in NATO's button-down headquarters in black loafers, with rimless glasses, and sporting a sparse, salt-and-pepper beard and mustache (but no gray hair yet). **********And indeed he has a Ph.D. in solid-state physics and, after graduate study at the University of Virginia in the 1960's, became a professor of physics at the Complutense University in Madrid in 1974. **********But politics has always been his true vocation; he likes to describe himself as a social democrat rather than a socialist. Born in Madrid on July 14, 1942, under the fascist dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, Mr. Solana quickly became a troublemaker. **********He joined Spain's underground Socialist Party in 1964, a year after being expelled from the university where he later returned to teach, because he had been active in youth organizations opposed to Franco. **********''I am a European, and I come from a country that has suffered very much in its history this century from a civil war,'' Mr. Solana said, with images of columns of Albanian civilians fleeing repression in Kosovo on the television screen in his office on the first floor of NATO headquarters, just outside Brussels. **********''We have to say very clearly that we cannot live together with people in Europe who behave in this manner at the end of the 20th century,'' he said, referring to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. ''The great frustration I've had in dealing with the Balkans is a good number of leaders are people with their heads turned to the past, not to the future.'' **********His own head firmly turned to the future, he met Felipe Gonzalez, a charismatic young Spanish Socialist leader, in the early 1970's, when the party was still a clandestine organization. When Spain established a constitutional monarchy with an elected legislature after Franco's death in 1975, Mr. Gonzalez led the Socialist opposition out into the open, with Mr. Solana at his side. **********Until Mr. Gonzalez was elected Prime Minister in 1982, Mr. Solana opposed conservative attempts to establish a close military relationship with the United States. The future leader of NATO opposed the presence of American military bases in Spain and, after a conservative Spanish Government negotiated Spain's entry into the North Atlantic Alliance just before the Socialists' election victory in 1982, he opposed that, too. **********Once in power, the Socialists changed their minds. Mr. Solana then played an important role in organizing a referendum in 1986 endorsing the participation of Spain in the alliance if it kept its forces out of NATO's integrated military structure. **********Mr. Solana's summons to Brussels came at the end of 1995, after Willy Claes, the Secretary General at the time, was indicted in a Belgian military-procurement and bribery scandal stemming from his years as a Socialist Party leader. The United States and its European allies clashed over two other candidates, and Mr. Solana was the compromise. **********As Secretary General, Mr. Solana has presided over the post-cold-war alliance transformation that had been prepared by his two immediate predecessors, Mr. Claes and the late Manfred Worner of Germany. **********So he presided over the political decisions NATO made to send 60,000 peacekeepers to Bosnia, just after he took office, and to take in three formerly Communist countries, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, at a summit meeting in 1997. **********Now Mr. Solana presides over daily and often contentious meetings of the 19-member North Atlantic Council to oversee the bombing campaign. **********The Council gave him authority at the end of January to decide, after consulting with President Clinton and other allied leaders, to give the go-ahead to NATO's top military commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark of the United States. **********He took that step on March 23. Now his main job, another military officer said, is to keep the allies in line with diplomacy and an easygoing, informal backslapping style that many NATO diplomats credit with maintaining the fragile consensus. **********If the bombing eventually succeeds in bringing peace to Kosovo, Mr. Solana will be a hero in Spain, where he could run for Prime Minister in elections that are to be held by March 2000. If it fails, he will be among the first political casualties, close behind the alliance's relationship with Moscow that he has tried to nurture despite Russia's opposition to the bombing. ''We may fail, or not achieve 100 percent,'' he said with a shrug. ''But we have shown we have the will to try.'' **********His family life, he conceded two years ago, has suffered from his work; his wife, Concepcion Gimenez, whom he met as a student in the United States, lives in Madrid, where she works, with their daughter, Vega, and son, Diego, while Mr. Solana commutes every weekend or two from Brussels. But now, he said, he lives mainly in his office."

The problem: the magazine's use of his face in a fashion spread. **********In the March 1997 issue, the magazine, a subsidiary of Capital Cities ABC, used an image of Mr. Hoffman's face from his role in ''Tootsie,'' the 1982 movie in which his character disguised himself as a woman to get an acting job. The image was superimposed on a model wearing a smashing gown and smart high heels. **********A caption for the shot, which was included in a roundup of what the stars might have worn if their big films had been made in 1997, said: ''Dustin Hoffman isn't a drag in a butter-colored silk gown by Richard Tyler and Ralph Lauren heels.'' **********The suit centers on an area of law called right of publicity, which is supposed to give celebrities the right to control the manner and circumstances under which their name and image are used for commercial purposes. That right was infringed here in a very serious and intentional manner, said Mr. Hoffman's lawyer, Charles N. Shephard. Lawyers for the magazine, who declined comment, have asserted a First Amendment right to use Mr. Hoffman's image in the shoot. **********Lawyers for the magazine would not comment on the case. Neither would Mr. Hoffman. But during his testimony last week, he expressed some apparent displeasure at having his image used as a fashion model. Mr. Hoffman testified, ''If I were to do a commercial, I hardly think it would be selling clothes, male or female.''   CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN"

Imagine how they feel about altering the initial digits of nearly every phone number in the nation. **********Booming demand for cellular phones, Internet lines, fax machines and other modern wonders is putting pressure on the supply of phone numbers in many countries. But Britain is not just adding a few new ranges of numbers: the whole numbering system must be overhauled, the authorities say. **********The part that is changing is the city code, a geographical prefix, like an American area code, that is used when dialing anywhere but the immediate vicinity. The old ones all began with 01, and varied in length from four digits to six; the new ones will start with 02. (Callers from outside Britain omit the 0.) **********For now, both the old and new prefixes both work. But come April 22, 2000 -- a date that is taking on an almost millennial urgency here -- the old codes will disappear. Among those being retired is the most desirable in the nation, 0171, the London equivalent of Manhattan's venerable 212, to be replaced mainly by an unconvincing 0207. **********Not only do the new phone numbers look  ''dodgy,'' as David Franklin, a local businessman, put it; they are wreaking havoc on most British businesses. The new codes mean that almost every phone system more than a year or two old must be modified with new software, or, in many cases, ripped out and replaced. Every business card and letterhead must be reprinted, product package corrected, billboard repainted, data base updated. No Filofax is safe. **********''No one has ever seen numbers like this before -- everyone asks if they are calling New Zealand,'' said Steven W. Blamer, chief executive of Grey Advertising in London. **********''It won't be like the world is coming to an end,'' he added, ''but we're going to have to deal with it.'' **********Grey, for one, has already started using its new prefix on promotional videotapes,  and plans to update its brochures and stationery in the next few months. Like some other businesses, Grey is using the occasion of having to modify its system to upgrade it, too, to a sophisticated wireless digital network. **********''This is the biggest and most complex overhaul of the U.K.'s number scheme,'' said Steve Brabenec, campaign manager for the Big Number, the Government agency responsible for the transition. ''We gave business users early notice so they could make important changes to phone systems and equipment.'' **********Most big businesses can shrug off transition expenses like the $160,000 that one of the country's biggest banks is said to be paying for stationery alone. But many smaller businesses with fewer resources are squawking in pain. **********''It's diabolical,'' said Mr. Franklin, whose company makes air fresheners and employs 11 people. ''All of our packaging has to be changed. We should sue for damages.'' **********Mr. Franklin has already had to replace $7,500 of packaging and may have to spend twice that again by April 22. He said his workers' profit-sharing would be severely affected. ''It's a direct loss to us,'' he said. ''How do I tell my employees that we sold even more units this year, and yet they're going to make less for no reason?'' **********While some companies are crying foul, others are reaping windfall business from the change. Prontaprint, Britain's equivalent of Kinko's, said its stationery business almost doubled over the summer from customers ranging from large multinational companies to home businesses. The company has begun an advertising campaign specifically appealing to customers who have yet to change their printed materials. And, naturally, telephone system makers, technicians and consultants are at their busiest. **********Oddly, this is the third phone number overhaul for this set-in-its-ways nation in just 10 years. And this one, by many accounts the most disruptive of the three, was never supposed to happen. **********Last time, four years ago, Don Cruickshank, then the director general of Britain's Office of Telecommunications, pledged: ''You will not have to change your number again in your lifetime.'' **********He did not foresee the explosive growth of cellular phone and Internet use that has since produced an overwhelming demand for new telephone numbers. In 1995, the Internet was not even a blip on the agency's radar screen: Internet use was taking off around that time in the United States but was not even in its infancy in Europe, officials said. That the numbering system introduced then didn't anticipate how big the surge in demand for numbers would become annoys many Britons today. **********''To change it once may be O.K.,'' Mr. Franklin said. ''A second time is dodgy. But a third time in the same decade is totally inexcusable. It's simply incompetence to the highest degree.'' **********Adding to the confusion here is the legacy of a numbering system that was never standardized. An ordinary phone number may have 5 to 11 digits, depending on where the caller is located; cell phone numbers usually have 10 or 11 digits. The new system will harmonize most of the country's phone numbers at 11 digits, including the city code prefix. **********The only unaffected part of the phone system will be toll-free numbers, whose 0800 prefix is staying -- though rising demand has forced the introduction of a second toll-free prefix, 0808. **********Most large telephone-system vendors that operate in Britain, including Lucent Technologies, the market leader, said software upgrades for the systems it sells are covered under most customers' service contracts. When they are not covered, Lucent charges a flat fee of $:150, or about $243. But some older systems, like those made by SDX, now a unit of Lucent, cannot handle the new codes correctly and cannot readily be upgraded; such old systems are becoming a frequent sight at electronics scrap dealers and salvage yards. **********And no one has yet toted up the secondary costs, like those for manually reprogramming a countryful of dial-up modems and speed-dial buttons. In typical British fashion, David Hands, a spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, would say only,  ''It'll be a bit of a hassle.''"

A British prime minister was fighting the French at a European Union summit meeting to secure a large cash rebate from the EU budget, as if inspired by his pugnacious predecessor Margaret Thatcher. **********When Britain largely got her way, angry French officials warned that the outcome would lead to ""permanent confrontation"" in the future. The British duly declared victory โ for Britain, of course, not for Europe. **********The ""victory"" achieved by Tony Blair at the EU summit meeting in Berlin last week did not hit the headlines, coinciding as it did with the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. But it did again raise one of the most intriguing questions of European politics: How genuinely pro-European is Mr. Blair? **********The answer to that question will determine how hard Mr. Blair fights to incorporate the pound into the European single currency, the euro โ as he has pledged to do ""in principle"" โ if the economic and political going gets rough in the next few years. **********At one level, Mr. Blair's performance in Berlin blended seamlessly with the traditional British practice of treating EU meetings as zero-sum games that have to be ""won"" against partners who are really opponents. **********As Hugo Young writes in a new book, ""This Blessed Plot,"" which chronicles Britain's tortured relations with Europe for the past half-century, there is no trace of any prime minister, including Mr. Blair, claiming to have supported an EU decision solely because it was best for the future of Europe. **********Unlike the Continental countries, Mr. Young says, Britain regarded her entry into Europe as a defeat โ ""a fate she had resisted, a necessity reluctantly accepted, the last resort of a once great power."" **********What's more, as Roy Denman writes in another recent book on Britain's links with Europe, ""Missed Chances,"" Britain has always had a blind spot as to the complexities of Continental European politics and the dynamics of European integration. **********Mr. Blair, however, in some ways differs from his predecessors. He has orchestrated pleasanter mood music on the theme of European unity, and he is backed by such a huge and unusual parliamentary majority that he can appear moderately pro-European in relative political safety. **********In Berlin, his officials used the French word ""communautaire,"" or community-minded, to describe his approach โ a word that implies respect for the supranational elements of European integration as it has been practiced since the 1950s, and one that could never have been applied to Lady Thatcher. **********But Mr. Blair has still not made a clean break with Britain's long history of vacillating over European integration. Like those of his predecessors, his European policies will ultimately be shaped by domestic politics, not by European idealism. **********Mr. Blair's handling of the euro issue will accordingly be dictated by short-term political considerations โ the chief of which is getting re-elected. **********Mr. Blair is a Clintonesque, not a Churchillian, politician, more interested in the cut-and-thrust of daily politics than the broad sweep of history. His efforts to ""modernize"" Britain, for example by ceding political power to Scotland and Wales and drastically reshaping the House of Lords, are not thought through. **********They have their origin in simple political calculations as to the state of Labour Party support in Scotland and the problems of facing a large block of Conservative hereditary peers in the upper chamber โ not in a coherent vision of Britain's future. **********His approach to Europe is much the same. His policy on the euro will be formed not by long-term thinking about Britain's world role or the best framework for European unity but by what seems politically and economically expedient at the time. That is partly why some perceptive Britons say that their country's widely predicted adoption of the euro is far from a foregone conclusion. **********E-mail address: Thinkahead@iht.com"

The Nasdaq market began by extending Wednesday's steep slide, only to stage an impressive rally and close up 14.49 points at 2,521.77. **********''What you're seeing is a classic'' realignment, said Charles J. Pradilla, chief strategist at S. G. Cowen Securities. ''Even though the market is hitting new highs, the rotation below the surface has been extraordinarily dramatic.'' **********In a trend that has come into focus over the last week or so, shares of producers of machinery, chemicals, paper, oil and other industrial goods are in strong demand. Chevron, Minnesota Mining and United Technologies all gained more than four points yesterday to pace the Dow blue-chip average, followed by Boeing, Exxon, International Paper and Goodyear, all up more than three points. **********Much of the impetus has come from evidence of economic revival -- or at least improved prospects -- overseas and a pickup in business at American factories. A Federal Reserve report of faster industrial growth in the Philadelphia region added to these signs yesterday. **********Some recent favorites were hammered, in the meantime, including Pfizer, down 14 5/8, to 130, after reporting first-quarter profits that matched expectations but also warning that second-quarter earnings-per-share growth would be only in the single digits. EMC slumped 9 3/16 , to 115 7/8, after Storage Technology, a chief rival in the data storage business, reported disappointing profits and the layoff of 6 percent of its work force. Storage Technology plunged 7 1/16 , to 19. **********Internet stocks slumped heavily but then rallied to finish mostly with small changes. An exception was Ebay, which gained 16, to 178 7/8, after trading as low as 152 1/2. **********''It's wild stuff,'' said Philip L. Rettew, a senior market analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''There haven't been many times that this is like -- the enormous degree of speculation,'' especially in companies that have yet to earn a dime. People have now decided, Mr. Rettew added, that even Internet stocks are to be bought, rather than fled from, on dips. **********The April 15 tax deadline, analysts said, contributed to the day's market activity, as some people added money to retirement accounts that might otherwise have gone to Washington. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, volume swelled to 1.09 billion shares from 952 million on Wednesday. Trading on Nasdaq eased from Wednesday's record-setting 1.42 billion shares to 1.23 billion, still the ninth busiest ever. **********With yesterday's gain, the Dow industrials are ahead 13.96 percent for the year. The Dow's gain briefly surpassed the Nasdaq's before that market's composite index rallied, up 15.01 percent so far in 1999. **********Boeing, up 3 3/8 on Wednesday, added an additional 3 11/16  yesterday, closing at 41 11/16 , after announcing earnings that beat expectations. **********General Motors and Ford also reported higher profits than most Wall Street analysts had forecast, but Ford edged up only 1/16 , to 62 13/16 , while G.M. fell 3 3/16 , to 86 9/16 . The decline was said to reflect G.M.'s shrinking market share, high retiree costs at the parts unit it is spinning off and the fact that profits were not as good as the most optimistic analysts hoped. **********Mattel, the toy maker, climbed 2 5/16 , to 28 1/4, after announcing that it would close plants, discharge 10 percent of its work force and form an Internet unit, part of which would be sold to the public. It also reported a loss. **********Several stock brokers were hard hit, including Charles Schwab, which gave back 14 1/4 more points, to 124, after losing 12 1/4 on Wednesday. The firm's earnings matched predictions, but analysts had hoped for faster growth of its on-line trading business. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette slumped 7 15/16 , to 85 1/16 . **********Airline stocks, sharply higher on Wednesday, fell yesterday. Delta Air Lines slumped 3 3/16 , to 68, despite stronger earnings, as analysts fretted about overcapacity and a dispute with pilots. UAL fell 4 5/16 , to 77 3/4. **********Drug stocks fell again. In addition to Pfizer's skid, Schering-Plough lost 3 1/8, to 52 1/16 , and Bristol-Myers 3, to 61 5/8. **********The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.58 points, or 42-hundredths of 1 percent. The Dow industrials and the Nasdaq, up 49-hundreths of 1 percent and 58-hundredths of 1 percent, respectively. The Russell 2000, a gauge of small-capitalization stocks, edged up nine-hundredths of 1 percent. **********Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange beat declining ones by 1,781 to 1,295; there were 74 new 52-week highs and 56 new lows. **********The Mexican Bolsa advanced 3.65 percent, but major markets in Japan, Brazil and most of Europe were down by fractions of 1 percent."

""Korea has accelerated reform progress and has moved rapidly to redress serious structural issues."" **********Such comments typified the response of visitors including representatives of the International Monetary Fund, which pieced together a rescue package of nearly $60 billion in December 1997 when the country had only several billion dollars in foreign exchange reserves and was unable to pay off short-term debts. **********South Korean officials regarded the upgrade by Moody's as a final stamp of approval showing that the country had survived the worst of the economic crisis. Both Fitch IBCA and Standard & Poor's Corp. raised their ratings in January, but officials here viewed the rating of Moody's, the oldest and most prestigious of the rating agencies, as the final international seal of approval on their efforts at resuscitating the economy. **********""We have to make the right decision to send the right signal to the investment community,"" said Thomas Byrne, Moody's lead analyst on South Korea. **********With the Moody's endorsement, officials expect to attract both equity and foreign direct investment, which is viewed as essential to fulfilling the forecasts of both the Finance Ministry and the International Monetary Fund of a 2 percent increase in the gross national product this year after a 6.8 percent decline last year. **********""Whenever they change their ratings on Korea, there's a market reaction,"" said Byun Yang Ho, director of the Finance Ministry's international finance division. ""Whenever they announce good news, the market price gets better for our government bonds."" **********But the improved ratings came with qualifications, reflecting a widespread view among experts that South Korea still has far to go, and could suffer a relapse if it fails to follow through on reforms. **********""We shouldn't be euphoric about the increase in gross national product,"" said Mr. Byrne. ""This is an economy in a recovery phase, but more people will be unemployed and income will be declining."" **********The Moody's report balanced praise for the buildup of foreign exchange reserves, stabilization of the exchange rate and the decline in interest rates with worries about rising unemployment and the failure of the country's chaebol, or conglomerates, to restructure quickly. **********""Despite the favorable outlook, domestic adjustment will be long and difficult,"" said the report, predicting that growth ""will likely be accompanied with stubbornly high unemployment and falling real wages."" **********Mr. Johnston, who took over at the OECD shortly before South Korea was admitted in 1996, cited strengthening of the banking sector, industrial restructuring and improved social welfare for the unemployed as major needs. **********But he argued against the view that South Korea was not economically strong enough to qualify for membership in the organization at the time that it joined. **********Moody's said it was raising South Korea's foreign currency country ceiling for long-term bonds and notes to Baa-3 from Ba-1 and the foreign currency country ceiling for bank deposits to Ba-2 from Caa-1. ""The outlook is positive for both foreign currency country ceilings,"" it said, while the rating for the government's won obligations was set at Baa-1 ""with a stable outlook."" **********Moody's cited South Korea's ""vastly improved external liquidity position"" as well as steps to liberalize foreign investment and ""put into place a comprehensive framework for reform and restructuring of the financial and corporate sectors."" **********Mr. Byrne, whose final review last week resulted in the upgrade, saw the sense of official optimism here as helpful in itself in improving the economy. **********""They've gone from a state of pain to feeling, 'Maybe we'll pull out of this,""' he said. ""The psychology is changing here. If people feel their jobs and income are more stable, they'll start spending again."""

It was even more grating that he did it on a shoestring budget, mostly with phone lines he leased from Telekom itself. **********But what really drove Telekom crazy was his advertising cheek. When Mr. Schmid ran ads that looked exactly as if they had come from Telekom, the company -- once a state-owned monopoly -- fired back with full-page ads of its own announcing a ''TRAP!'' And when Mr. Schmid mailed fliers promising ''to put your phone bill on a diet,'' Telekom lawyers obtained court orders to block him, arguing that not all his prices were lower than Telekom's. **********Yet none of that has stopped Mr. Schmid, 46, from becoming an overnight billionaire. As founder of Mobilcom, based in this remote hamlet in the far northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, Mr. Schmid has roared out of nowhere, turning his company into the second-largest long-distance carrier in Europe's biggest and most bruising telephone market. **********Long-distance prices have plunged by as much as 70 percent, and new price wars are breaking out in Internet-access service. Deutsche Telekom, analysts estimate, has already lost about 30 percent of its long-distance market and may lose more this year. Goldman, Sachs, which managed part of Deutsche Telekom's initial public stock offering two years ago, summed up the turmoil in a recent report: ''What is Going On in Germany?'' **********And what's happening in Germany is also happening, to a lesser degree, elsewhere in Europe. Fourteen months after the European Union ordered all 15 member countries to open their telephone markets, competition is flaring up from Austria to Spain. **********Some of the new competitors are huge consortiums, often led by power companies and railroads. Some of them are upstarts like Mobilcom that lease lines at volume discounts and resell service to customers at cut-rate prices. **********In Italy, Olivetti added a new twist this week by starting a hostile takeover attempt of the national telephone company, Telecom Italia. Olivetti owns Italy's second-biggest cellular service as well as Infostrada, the leading competitor in fixed-line phone service. [Market Place, page C6.] **********But the sudden shock has been greatest in Germany. ''No other country has seen a market share loss like the one we've seen in Germany,'' said Chris Hohre, analyst at HSBC Securities in London. ''To be fair, the Government has not made life easy for Telekom. But the bigger problem is its own cost basis. Its costs are still very high.'' **********The tide may be shifting. Alarmed by Deutsche Telekom's decline last year, German regulators softened their relentlessly hard stance and set new rules this month that will make it more expensive for rivals to enter the local telephone market. **********Just as important, Deutsche Telekom has shot back at its rivals with drastic price cuts. At the start of the year, it slashed most of its long-distance rates by more than 50 percent. The price of a daytime call on weekdays, for example, dropped from 56 pfennigs, or about 31 cents, to 24 pfennigs a minute. Earlier this month, Telekom announced plans to cut rates again in March or April. **********Indeed, Deutsche Telekom's stock has soared by about 50 percent since the New Year, partly on expectations that the worst may be over. Shares of other former monopolies, among them France Telecom and Telecom Italia, have climbed sharply as well. **********But that's nothing compared with what happened to Mobilcom, whose stock market value climbed tenfold from early 1998 to early 1999, peaking at more than $4 billion before retreating somewhat recently. That move reflects a quadrupling of its sales last year to 1.4 billion marks, or $820 million, and a ninefold increase in profits to $147 million. Mr. Schmid owns 60 percent of the stock. **********Across the rest of Europe, the impact of new competition varies considerably. Some countries, like Britain and Finland, have had open telecom markets for several years. In others, like Spain and Italy, government regulators have made life tougher for newcomers and slowed the change. In the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, competition has been brutal. **********Some of the old monopolies prepared for competition much better than others. France Telecom, for example, has lost only about 4 percent of its long-distance market, while its sales and profits have both climbed sharply. **********''The main difference is that France Telecom bit the bullet early,'' said Victoria Granger, a telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''They imposed some really heavy tariff cuts. And they spent a huge amount of money building a brand name before liberalization.'' **********Deutsche Telekom also cut its prices ahead of competition, but its prices at the beginning of 1998 were still twice as high as those in neighboring countries. According to data compiled by Phillips Tarifica Ltd., a London-based publisher of industry newsletters, a three-minute long-distance call during business hours then cost 87 cents in Germany, 47 cents in France and only 29 cents in Finland. **********That alone would have made Telekom a sitting duck. But the German Government added to the pressure by forcing the company to charge relatively low prices for interconnecting with its network. Rivals could lease lines at low prices and offer cheap service without building their own networks. **********Not surprisingly, competitors flooded into Germany. The biggest was Mannesmann Arcor, a consortium led by Mannesmann A.G. and Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway. Arcor has invested billions of dollars to build its own network, and executives do not expect the company to break even for several years. **********Two other big industrial groups have built networks as well. One is O.Tel.O, led by the industrial conglomerate Veba A.G. The third is Viag Interkom, led by the Bavarian power company Viag A.G. and British Telecommunications. **********But the most successful and improbable competitor was Mr. Schmid's Mobilcom. Blond and stocky, Mr. Schmid had been head of tourism at a health resort on the Baltic Sea in the 1980's before running marketing at Germany's biggest local rental-car agency. **********Mr. Schmid started Mobilcom in 1991 to repackage and market cellular telephone services offered by other companies. When the ordinary telephone market opened up to rivals, he saw an opportunity to resell services there, too. **********Unlike his rivals, Mr. Schmid had no intention of building his own network. ''You can build up your own infrastructure, but the start-up losses are very high,'' he said recently at the company's glass-and-steel headquarters here. ''The other strategy is to first get the customers, then get the cash flow and finally to use the cash flow to build the pipelines.'' **********The plan was childishly simple. Mobilcom leased lines from Deutsche Telekom. Customers use his service by dialing a five-digit access code, and they are billed through Telekom. **********But the real lure was pricing. Mobilcom started by charging a flat rate of 19 pfennigs, or about 11 cents, a minute around the clock -- well below Telecom's peak rate of 56 pfennigs a minute. **********''Everybody else had planned for step-by-step decreases in telephone prices,'' Mr. Schmid said. ''We thought, what would happen if we cut prices all at once by 70 percent?'' **********His model was Worldcom, the American long-distance service that began by reselling services from bigger companies and then later acquired rivals in a process that culminated last year with the takeover of MCI Communications. **********The analogy is resonant. Much as Mr. Schmid started his company in the rural state of Schleswig-Holstein, Worldcom's founder, Bernard Ebbers, built his company in the relative obscurity of Jackson, Miss. **********In any case, Mr. Schmid got an enormous response that stunned not only Telekom but also rivals like Mannesmann. Analysts estimate that Mobilcom lured about 20 million minutes of use each day by the end of last year, about 10 percent of the total volume and second only to Deutsche Telekom. Mannesmann Arcor came in next, attracting about 18 million minutes a day. **********In hindsight, Deutsche Telekom was extremely slow to respond. It cut its long-distance and international prices by an average of 4.5 percent in March 1998, and then waited another nine months before imposing much more dramatic cuts. **********Hans-Willi Hefekauser, in charge of regulation and pricing policy at Deutsche Telekom, said his company had little choice. **********''Imagine what would have happened if we had rushed in the spring or summer of 1998 with big reductions,'' he said. ''Everybody would have said you aren't giving competition any chance to evolve. Regulated companies can do a lot in regulated markets, but they can never do it first.'' **********The price war is in full swing now. Arcor cut its prices by as much as 54 percent in January and O.Tel.O dropped some of its prices by 61 percent. Mobilcom has cut its prices twice now. For customers who simply use it on a call-by-call basis, without subscribing, it dropped nighttime rates to just 8 pfennigs a minute. **********The turmoil has jolted Mobilcom's sky-high stock price. After soaring to 445 euros ($489) in late January, it fell back sharply to 357 euros today. **********Mr. Schmid says he can easily match any of Telekom's price cuts, and analysts note that his gross margin has been so high -- 55 percent -- that he should still have considerable maneuvering room. Meanwhile, Mr. Schmid began a low-cost Internet service in December that attracted 40,000 customers in its first month. **********Nevertheless, the risks are high. Only 5 percent of Mobilcom's long-distance revenues come from registered subscribers. The rest is from people who use its access code on a call-by-call basis. **********That approach makes it easy to attract customers, but it does nothing to build customer loyalty. Virtually all of the contact with customers is through Deutsche Telekom. If telephone prices draw closer together, Mobilcom customers could vanish quickly. **********At least for now, though, many investors seem content to hang on for the ride."

The Turkish Army portrays itself as a quintessentially national institution that is always ready to step in when the nation is in danger. **********But for several days after the earthquake, it maintained a remarkably low profile, leaving the rescue effort to civilian agencies and foreign volunteers. **********Spokesmen for the general staff did not respond to requests for an explanation of the army's position. One newspaper quoted an unidentified Government official as saying that civilian leaders ''had coordination and communication problems with the military for 48 hours, which were resolved on Thursday.'' Another said the military ''suffered huge logistical problems on the first day after the quake,'' but had since overcome them. **********An official close to the military said commanders feared that thrusting themselves into the spotlight would give the impression that they are running Turkey. The commanders have played a decisive role in domestic politics during the last few years, and are sensitive to assertions  that they are intruding into spheres where they do not belong. **********''There was a feeling that the military shouldn't just go in and start giving orders,'' said the official. ''Civilian institutions have to be allowed to do their jobs.'' **********Published reports said Turkish officials have reprimanded the state-owned TRT television network for broadcasting footage suggesting that Government negligence was responsible for chaos in the rescue effort. **********A coordinator of the effort, Minister of State Sukru Gurel, pledged to review complaints against contractors who built homes that did not withstand the quake. ''We will try to do our best, both in investigating and trying to overcome this structural problem in the future,'' he said. **********The chairman of the Turkish Contractors Association, Kadir Sever, issued a statement asking people not to blame all contractors for shoddy construction practices. **********''The problem is that it is too easy to be a contractor in Turkey,'' Mr. Sever said. ''There are 40,000 contractors doing business in Turkey, and most of them are unqualified.'' **********There were several minor tremors in the earthquake zone on Friday and today, and thousands of people slept outdoors in fear of more serious aftershocks. Most seismologists, though, say there is little danger of another major quake soon. **********Now that so much time has passed since Tuesday's disaster, the recovery of each survivor represents a near-miracle. At midday today an Austrian team pulled a 95-year-old woman from the wreckage of a vacation complex in the seaside town of Yalova. She told her rescuers that she thought others were still alive beneath the same pile of debris. **********Many roads in the affected area were jammed for days by well-meaning Turks who were trying to bring aid to victims, but whose presence made it difficult for ambulances and rescue teams to move. As the huge traffic jams began to ease, officials from several countries toured the area. Among them were the Belgian and Japanese Foreign Ministers, the chief medical officer of the Israeli Army, and the United States Ambassador, Mark Parris. **********''No one who visits here can help but be shocked by the level of devastation,'' Mr. Parris said. He pledged that the United States would ''do everything in its power to help Turkey deal with the tragic consequences of the earthquake.'' **********American participation in the relief effort is expected to surge in the coming days. Three warships carrying more than 3,000 sailors and marines, and equipped with operating rooms and other medical installations to tend to the more than 30,000 people estimated to be injured, are scheduled to arrive in Turkish waters during the weekend. **********The decision to assign soldiers to collect refuse was one of several steps taken to help prevent the outbreak of an epidemic. Medical teams have begun spraying disinfectants, immunizing rescue workers against typhoid and distributing chlorine tablets for water purification. Recovered bodies are being quickly photographed for future identification and then buried. In the devastated town of Adapazari, 963 bodies were interred in a mass grave. **********''There are many people, plus animals and food, under the debris,'' said Rifat Kose, an official at the health ministry. ''An epidemic could occur as they decay, but we are taking necessary measures.'' **********With dozens of countries now actively involved in the aid effort here, the President of neighboring Iraq, Saddam Hussein, declared that he was determined to provide more help than the United States. **********According to news reports from Baghdad, Mr. Hussein is ready to offer large amounts of crude oil that could be traded for relief supplies or sold to finance reconstruction."

Berber most about the new ''living wage'' ordinance in Los Angeles is the picketing at his restaurant, La Luz del Dia, during a busy lunch hour. ''The way they are dressed,'' he said, ''they give the impression they are my regular customers, very dissatisfied. It hurts me personally.'' **********The pickets are in fact community advocates who pushed for passage of the local law, which increases minimum wages at companies doing business with the city. Because Mr. Berber leases his site in a subsidized tourist zone, the ordinance requires him to pay $8.76 an hour, not the $5.75 that is standard pay for kitchen help here. The reasoning is that all his workers should benefit from the public largess that makes the quaint Olvera Street where his Mexican restaurant is situated so profitable. Mr. Berber has raised his bottom wage, but only to $6.75 an hour, without health insurance -- and the pickets are trying to get him to go the extra distance. **********''I am moving in the direction of conforming,'' he said, leaning for emphasis across a huge, cluttered desk that almost filled his small, low-ceilinged office. But to pay the full wage now, he said, would put his restaurant in the red. **********Here and elsewhere, a small but increasing number of employers who do business with government are suddenly finding themselves required by local ordinances to grant big raises and benefits to their low-wage workers. Forty cities and counties in 17 states, particularly those with large constituencies of low-wage workers, have enacted such wage laws since the movement began five years ago. **********As one follows another, lately at the rate of a new ordinance a month, the movement has begun to broaden from a simple emphasis on higher wages into a wide range of requirements involving health insurance, vacations, sick pay, job security and incentives to unionize. **********''You have to look at the living wage movement in the context of the utter failure of federal labor law, now so stacked against workers,'' said Madeline Janis-Aparicio, director of the Los Angeles Living Wage Coalition. She cited what she said was Washington's failure to raise the national minimum wage to keep pace with the needs of the working poor or to strengthen labor's bargaining power. The coalition, an amalgam of community groups, churches and unions that organized the picketing at Mr. Berber's restaurant, is out to redress the balance. **********As the ordinances spread, business opposition and complaints about higher costs and patchwork regulation are on the rise. But the vast majority of affected companies, though often ducking full compliance, have generally lived with the law rather than give up profitable contracts, subsidies and leases on choice city-owned properties like Olvera Street, three studies have found. The early evidence suggests that relatively little of the extra cost has been passed on to the cities or to consumers. Companies are absorbing the higher wages or finding ways to offset them. **********''The cost increases for companies in Los Angeles were only 1 to 1.5 percent of their total expenses,'' said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who led one of the studies. **********The ''living wage'' movement is an increasingly popular tool for improving the lot of janitors, cleaning people, restaurant and health care workers, security guards, school bus drivers, parking attendants and others who earn less than $8 an hour. That group represents 25.7 percent of the work force, or 28.5 million people. **********Yet only a fraction of these workers -- no more than 44,000, according to an analysis by Mr. Pollin, Mark Brenner and Stephanie Luce -- are covered so far by wage ordinances, the largest group being the 9,000 or so in Los Angeles. But more than 50 other cities and counties are considering such bills. One alone, in San Francisco, would nearly double the number of workers covered nationwide if the proposal now before the Board of Supervisors passes. **********The ordinances cover the companies that tap the public till through a tax abatement, for example, or a service contract to clean schools or through leases at a city airport; the companies can be cut off if they fail to raise wages. Here in Los Angeles, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have accepted the ordinance as lessees at the international airport, imposing the new wage -- $8.76 without health insurance, or $7.51 in pay and $1.25 for health insurance -- on the contractors and subcontractors who supply baggage handlers, security screeners, wheelchair attendants and the like. The airlines' own employees generally earn more in wages and benefits than the law requires. **********''United resisted the ordinance for a while and could have tied us up in court for a long time,'' said Isaac Nuru, lead organizer at the airport for the Living Wage Coalition. ''But it did the moral thing; it did not want a bad press.'' **********The ordinances have their limits. They are hard to enforce even when city officials audit corporate payrolls, as they do in Los Angeles and one or two other cities. Further, though companies like United and Delta comply with the ordinance at the city-owned airport here, workers employed by contractors at the airlines' other sites in the city are not covered. And companies do not have to comply with the ordinances in most cities until existing contracts and leases are renewed or revised, though some companies do so anyway. **********Host Marriott Services did. It runs bars and restaurants at the airport here and has applied for a revision of its lease to expand. Even before submitting the application, the company increased the pay of 700 airport workers to the levels specified in the ordinance, which took effect last January at the airport. And in a bit of horse trading, Ms. Janis-Aparicio's coalition has endorsed Host Marriott's request. **********''You monitor every lease that comes up for renewal or revision,'' she said, ''and you go to the company and say, 'We want to work with you.' '' **********Still, much of American business, once indifferent to a movement that seemed to apply to so few workers, is now fighting the effort more vigorously -- denouncing the laws as an excessive cost for business and a distortion of wages, which should be set in the marketplace, not by government. **********''When you raise the wage so much, a lot of the people you are trying to help will lose their jobs,'' said Thomas R. Larmore, a lawyer in Santa Monica. He heads a Chamber of Commerce committee formed recently to prevent passage of a wage proposal in Santa Monica that would be the first in the country to go beyond companies that benefit directly from city business. The ordinance would apply to an entire commercial district, a two-mile stretch of Pacific coast developed with public funds as a tourist mecca. **********Within this zone, which extends three blocks inland from a promenade overlooking the ocean, no company with more than 50 employees would be allowed to pay its workers less than $10.69 an hour. Other provisions, borrowed from the Los Angeles ordinance, include paid vacations, a health insurance requirement and a provision to protect workers against retaliation. **********The zone flourishes, the argument goes, because the city spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop it as a tourist and entertainment center, and limited the number of hotel rooms, to help keep room rates high, often above $300 a night. Low-wage employees, advocates say, should share more of this public bounty, or at least earn a high enough wage to live in Santa Monica. Most commute from poor Los Angeles neighborhoods. **********Mr. Larmore says such reasoning is spurious. ''It is totally backward to say that business is subsidized by the city,'' he said. ''It is business that is lifting the city,'' he added, by providing a huge flow of tax revenue that allows the city to provide many services. **********A majority on Santa Monica's seven-member City Council, which recently approved a ban on automated teller fees for nonbank customers that has been temporarily set aside by a local court, favors the ordinance. But rather than act now, the council is likely to wait while the wage issue is fought out in next year's election campaign. The Chamber of Commerce is raising money to support candidates who will oppose it. **********Wage ordinances have become a goal of such national groups as the Independent Areas Foundation and the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now that seek to bring community groups together in social action campaigns. And with increasing frequency, the ordinances are becoming big issues in local politics. **********In San Francisco's Dec. 13 runoff election for mayor, the issue divides Willie Brown, the incumbent, who has been lukewarm about a wage law, and his challenger, Tom Ammiano, president of the Board of Supervisors and chief sponsor of the  proposal. It specifies a wage of $11 an hour, surpassing the current national leader, San Jose, where an ordinance requires $9.50 with health insurance and $10.75 without. By comparison, the national minimum wage is $5.15 an hour; adjusted for inflation, that is nearly $3 less than it was in 1968. **********''If the bill is watered down too much, say to $9 an hour,'' Mr. Ammiano said, ''and nonprofit organizations are exempted and there is not enough funding for enforcement, then I would advocate taking the proposal to a referendum.'' **********The first such ordinance was enacted in Baltimore, in December 1994, largely through the efforts of a community organization called Build. Last November, Build got thousands of residents in poor neighborhoods to the polls. Most voted for the re-election of Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, who is increasingly using the city's ordinance as a model for contracts that the state makes with private companies. **********Here in Los Angeles, Mayor Richard J. Riordan tried to block the measure, but his veto was overridden by the City Council. ''I believe employers should be aware that employees who earn under $10 an hour cannot lead an independent life,'' he said. ''But I do not believe that government should dictate wages. We have seen this fail in Socialist and Communist countries. It will do irreparable harm.'' **********Mayor Riordan said, however, that he agreed with supporters of the wage ordinance that income inequality had increased in part because of the decline in union bargaining power. Several ordinances try to reverse that trend through an ''opt out'' loophole that lets companies partly off the hook if they agree to let their workers organize. **********Half of Mr. Berber's 28 employees, for example, have signed a petition seeking union recognition. If he granted recognition voluntarily, the opt out clause would allow him to negotiate a labor agreement that permits pay and benefit levels below the city's mandated wage, at least temporarily. But he would be locked into a union -- a central goal of Ms. Janis-Aparicio's coalition. **********''Whenever you rely on legislation solely, the gains can be lost,'' she said, noting that the Los Angeles City Council's current pro-labor bent could disappear in a future election. ''So we need to build union agreements that have community support and will last.'' **********While running a refugee center here, Ms. Janis-Aparicio, 39, was recruited into her present line of work in 1993 by Miguel Contreras, now the powerful executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. **********Mr. Contreras, who had worked with Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers, was mindful of the public support -- the consumer grape boycott -- that had brought such success to the farm workers. So he asked Ms. Janis-Aparicio to set up a nonprofit organization that could foster similar community support for labor. She founded the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which operates with a $1 million annual budget and 18 salaried staff members. The wage issue soon became the central cause. **********''This question of job inequities in the public sector, if we address it as a union, people say we are self-serving,'' Mr. Contreras said. ''But if it has the cloak of religious leaders and community activists, then it becomes a community issue.'' **********New York Law Covers 1,400 **********New York was one of the first cities to adopt a ''living wage'' ordinance. Overriding a veto by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the City Council enacted a law on Sept. 11, 1996, that was narrow in scope and has never been expanded. **********About 1,400 people are covered. They are employees of companies that have contracted with the city to supply security guards, food service employees, cleaning workers and temporaries. A ''trend toward paying low wages'' appears to be ''most egregious'' in these four areas, the ordinance declares. **********But rather than fix a uniform minimum, the ordinance requires the city comptroller to determine the prevailing wage for each class of workers. The wages today for most of these workers fall between $7.50 and $12 an hour."

At 26, he runs a moderately successful car-rental business. But he is unable to expand his fleet of 14 vehicles, a move that would allow him to increase his profit and hire more employees. No bank in the Czech Republic will give him a loan. **********''When I started back in 1992, it was a piece of cake,'' he says. ''All the banks asked for was a copy of the papers for my three cars as collateral. But today, if you are a small business, getting a loan is next to impossible.'' **********Like Mr. Hovorka's operation, thousands of small and medium-sized Czech businesses have a shortage of cash and nowhere to raise money. The stock market offers little hope because volume is anemic and there is little investor interest in new stock offerings. **********And the banks are keeping their vaults shut. The bankers have been burned before. The Czech central bank estimates that nonperforming loans, worth $9 billion, constitute 30 percent of all loans outstanding. Private financial analysts think that could be as high as 40 percent. **********''As long as the share of nonperforming loans in the Czech banking system comes close to 30 percent, or even exceeds this figure, the sector can in no way assume its place among developed European and world economies,'' said Petr Zahradnik, an economist at Conseq Finance, a Czech investment firm. **********The bad loans carried by banks in this country rank them below banks in Poland and Hungary, where bad loans make up less than 20 percent of loans outstanding. Czech banks are also behind in the privatization that has helped transform banking systems in other East European nations. The Czech state is still the major shareholder in the two largest banks, Komercni Banka and Ceska Sporitelna. Polish and Hungarian banks, by contrast, are already privatized. **********Many of the bad loans in the Czech Republic date from the time of post-Communist transformation in the early 90's engineered by Vaclav Klaus, who was then Prime Minister.  His voucher privatization system enabled ordinary Czechs to buy shares in state-owned companies. **********But the banks established their own investment funds, which started buying back the shares. As a result, the largely state-owned banks acquired control over a large part of the economy and continued to provide loans to the unprofitable enterprises they controlled, in essence shoring up inefficient companies that had not been much changed since Communist times. **********The privatization plan also limited the influx of foreign capital, through its reliance on domestic entrepreneurs. Only a few companies, like the car maker Skoda, now part of Volkswagen of Germany, were sold directly to a foreign investor. Although the Czech Republic has been in recession for five consecutive quarters, Skoda has been consistently profitable and remains the most successful company in the country. **********Over all, the Czech economy is not entirely a story of bad news. Incomes are higher here than in Poland or Hungary, even if growth is lower. **********At the same time, a majority of the main industrial enterprises, led by bank-appointed managers, have been sinking deeper into a financial slump. And the banks have shut off the tap for small and midsize businesses, further hurting the economy. **********The current Czech Government, led by the Social Democratic Party for a little more than a year, has declared its intention to privatize Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni Banka by mid-2000. ''The Government's approach to foreign investors has changed,'' Finance Minister Pavel Mertlik said in a recent interview. ''We know that without direct foreign investment, we couldn't solve the economic problems of this country.'' **********But the potential investors, including Erste Bank of Austria for Ceska Sporitelna and Deutsche Bank for Komercni, may not be willing to invest money unless the state assumes responsibility for the bad loans. **********Komercni Banka is the largest bank in Eastern Europe by assets, and whoever buys it will have control over a quarter of the Czech economy, the Finance Minister said. **********That may sound like a great incentive for a buyer, regardless of the risks. But some economists are skeptical. ''I think it is unrealistic to expect that the banks could be sold at real profit,'' said Evzen Kocenda of the Prague-based Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education. ''I think they should be sold as they are now, without a Government bailout, which would have to be shouldered by the taxpayers.''"

Tractors pulled trailers filled with more people, some of Kosovo's poorest Serbs, who said that the armed insurgents of the Kosovo Liberation Army were moving back into western Kosovo towns and villages. **********''It's fine now for the Albanians,'' said one man named Bojan from Djakovica, whose car was stuffed with his extended family. ''It's not safe for Serbs anymore. The K.L.A. is in the town.'' Where will he go? ''I don't know,'' he said. ''How can I know?'' **********One little white Yugo car broke down on a hill, steam exploding from the hood. Three panicked Serbs grabbed suitcases and boxes and toys from the car to throw them into a trailer ahead of them in line, fearing that the convoy would move off without them. Left behind in the back window, as they pushed the car off the road, was a doll with blond hair. One old man gave the three-fingered Serb salute, normally a gesture of defiance, but a golden cross was draped through his fingers. **********Most of the cars had license plates from Prizren, Pec and Djakovica. On the road were fresh piles of clothing that had fallen off Serbian tractors, like the filthy, rotting clothes that still line some roads as a memory of the Albanian exodus. **********As the Serbs retreated east, they passed thousands of young Albanians who never left Kosovo, who lined the road and shouted, ''NATO! NATO!'' and ''Thank you!'' at any passing military vehicle. One little boy had ''NATO'' written on his forehead. Another carried a banner with the insignia of the K.L.A. **********The Albanians clapped and threw flowers on NATO's tanks and armored personnel carriers, as the Serbs, with more desperation than hope, had thrown flowers on the Russian tanks that moved through Pristina to occupy its airport very early Saturday morning. **********Many of the Albanians were forced to leave Kosovo, and some unknown number were killed for resisting, or for being deemed supporters or members of the K.L.A. Others were driven from their homes in the villages and fled to the hills, living in the rough for the three months of this war. **********By sharp contrast, of course, no one is pushing out the Serbs, who are fleeing from fear. Some Serbs surely bear guilt for the ravaging of their Albanian neighbors and the burning of their homes and businesses. Some Gypsies who helped the Serbs are also fleeing, and even some Turks from Prizren, this elegant 14-century Turkish town, who also helped Serbian officials and security officers roust Albanians. **********It is not at all clear that any of those now fleeing will come back, although some 5,000 or so are being put up at least temporarily in and around Pristina, especially in student housing around the university, which remains shut. **********''This is like the Germans fleeing Eastern Europe after World War II,'' said a senior diplomat from a NATO country who has been working with humanitarian agencies. ''What happened to the Germans there from 1945 to 1947 was the greatest movement of people since the end of the war, not Kosovo. Millions of Germans, perhaps 40 million, fled and no one had any sympathy, because they were guilty. It's a little bit like that now.'' **********The diplomat said he was sorry for the Serbs and for ''the likelihood of an ethnically clean Kosovo.'' ''NATO was supposed to synchronize its movements with the withdrawal of the Serbs, to prevent this vacuum, and it didn't happen. While every Albanian knew they would come home one day, these Serbs know they'll never come back. I don't question that in one way, but it adds to the wave of sorrow and misery here.'' **********Albanians are showing relief, happiness and some glee. In Prizren today, the main square was full of Albanians of all ages who had never left. Many of the younger men had hidden in their apartments for nearly three months, sending women and old men out to try to buy bread. **********They sang and cheered and gave flowers to the nonplussed young German soldiers of NATO's force. One young German, riding behind a machine gun on his jeep, had flowers strewn at his feet and tears pouring from his eyes. **********When the Germans arrived in Prizren about midnight, many Albanians greeted them in their pajamas and bathrobes, said Haki Bojniku, 20, an economics student. ''You cannot write down the way I feel now,'' he said, beginning himself to cry. ''I feel free now, like a person.'' **********Bina, 23, said life in the town had felt very dangerous with Serbian aggression and NATO bombs. ''I live in the middle of town and the Serbs didn't touch us,'' she said. ''But we heard what they did in the villages. And here they stole everything they could find, and they always asked for money. We waited hours in lines for bread and oil, and sometimes they said, 'It is only for Serbs.' They said, 'NATO will give you bread. You wanted NATO, ask them.' '' **********And now that NATO is in Prizren? ''When I saw them, I finally felt I could breathe the air,'' Bina said. **********Mohammed Abdullah, 34, said he survived by helping push a neighbor in a wheelchair. ''They wouldn't touch someone like that,'' he said. **********Shpend Kume, 18, said he and his family also remained at home, hidden away. ''They wanted the young men like me,'' he said. ''We heard that they took the young men. We sent my grandmother out for food.'' **********Asked what he felt when he saw the Serbs fleeing, he said simply: ''I'm happy. The Serbs are finished here. They shot and they robbed and set houses on fire.'' **********What about the innocent Serbs, and the children? ''Of course children are children,'' said Valton, 23, breaking in. ''And their mothers are maybe innocent, too. But their fathers did everything here, and they should go.''"

Ms. Hector's uncle is a partner of the firm. **********Barbara Green, Mr. Young's lawyer, said yesterday that Mr. Young would try to appeal the decision. ''I know the court worked hard on this decision,'' she said, ''but we think it is very wrong.'' **********Neither Mr. Young nor Ms. Hector could be reached for comment. **********Seven judges on the 10-judge appeals panel ruled yesterday that the trial court that had originally heard the custody battle had been correct when it awarded primary custody of the girls to Ms. Hector. **********The majority disagreed with Mr. Young's contention that the trial court had favored awarding the children to Ms. Hector simply because she was a woman. **********Mr. Young had argued that the trial court had discriminated against him and all stay-at-home fathers. ''Dads can be moms, too,'' he had said last year. **********But last year, when the appeals panel overturned the trial court's decision, Ms. Hector had said that she believed that the three-man panel took a hard stand against her simply because she was a mother pursuing a challenging career. She insisted that despite her demanding job, she spent more time with the two girls than her former husband did. **********Last year, Ms. Hector quit her job at Steel, Hector and opened her own small firm so that she could work more flexible hours. **********Mr. Young is a senior program director at the Y.M.C.A. of Greater Miami. **********The majority on the appeals court said that the trial court was correct when it relied on evidence suggesting that Ms. Hector had been a constant and dominant influence in the children's lives, while Mr. Young had not. When the two girls were very young, Mr. Young had been away from home for months at a time, settling business matters and hunting for gold believed buried in the desert. **********But in recent years, Mr. Young had been a volunteer at the girls' school, founded a Brownie troop and coached the soccer team. **********The three judges who dissented yesterday were the same three who had ruled against Ms. Hector last year. In his dissent, Alan R. Schwartz, the chief judge of the Third District state appeals court, said, ''there was no question'' that the trial court's decision had been ''dictated by the evil of gender bias.'' **********Judge Schwartz said that if the genders of the ''hard-working and high-earning lawyer and the stay-at- home architect'' had been reversed, ''the male attorney's claim for custody would have been virtually laughed out of court.''"

It is being fought in places like the Mines Beach Resort and Spa outside Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. **********There, in a conference room not far from the ocean, representatives of 34 of the world's largest communications companies joined official delegates from 14 nations on Feb. 6 to try to forge a consensus on the next generation of wireless phones. **********That they failed was hardly surprising. For the last 18 months, the biggest players in the wireless business, both carriers and equipment makers, have been embroiled in what an AT&T spokesman describes as a financial, regulatory and political holy war for control of the wireless future. **********In six weeks, the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency that set up the meeting in Malaysia, is scheduled to start approving international standards for wireless technologies for the next decade. But that process is being threatened by a general reluctance to compromise on arcane technical standards and in particular by intransigence on the part of Ericsson of Sweden and Qualcomm Inc., of San Diego, two big communications manufacturers that have feuded for years. **********The stakes are immense for both consumers and the companies. Over the next few years, most of the world's wireless carriers intend to introduce services that could prove technically momentous. With an emphasis on bringing high-speed data services to customers wherever they are, proponents of so-called third-generation wireless technology predict that the next wave of mobile phones will incorporate World Wide Web browsing and video conferences. Billions of dollars in revenue could await the companies that manufacture and sell the equipment that will make this happen. **********At the same time, a wave of consolidations is creating bigger and broader wireless carriers. Last month, for instance, the Vodafone Group, Britain's biggest wireless company, agreed to acquire Airtouch Communications of San Francisco, another huge wireless provider, for $60 billion. **********And as carriers extend their coverage, there is rising potential for callers to be able to use one phone, with one number, almost anywhere and at rates that are widely affordable. But to make that happen, the carriers, manufacturers and, to some extent, governments would have to agree on a single standard. Many industry insiders now think that will not happen. **********''The idea of one standard or a universal standard sounds good,'' said Jim Brewington, who runs the wireless business for Lucent Technologies, North America's largest communications equipment maker and a relatively neutral party in the dispute. ''We would like to see it happen. I frankly don't think it's going to happen.'' **********Fabio Leite, a wireless counselor for the telecommunications union in Geneva, said, ''We have a lot of reasons to be pessimistic.'' And even the adversaries concede that the fight, though couched in highly technical language, is really a political struggle. **********''If you're asking me is it a political issue or a technical issue, I'll say it's a political issue,'' said Keith Paglusch, a senior vice president of Sprint PCS, a big United States wireless carrier that essentially belongs to the Qualcomm camp. ''It really is a business/political issue.'' **********The roots of the row over third-generation wireless technology were put down in the early 90's, when it became clear that the first generation of wireless phones, analog cellular, was going to be replaced by a second digital generation known as P.C.S. -- personal communications services. **********At that time, Qualcomm was basically alone in advocating a wireless approach known as C.D.M.A., for code division multiple access. This works somewhat like the Internet in that it breaks messages into small bits, which are then scattered throughout the wireless telephone spectrum and reassembled at their destination. The idea that C.D.M.A., which was originally developed for military purposes, could be adapted to civilian use was heresy to many wireless engineers and their companies. **********Perhaps the most vociferous in its criticism was Ericsson, which had built a big second-generation wireless business on a competing technology called time division multiple access. That technology uses relatively narrow batches of wireless frequencies, which it then breaks up many times a second to convey many messages. **********It is in a lot of ways similar to a third technology in the wireless alphabet soup: GSM, or global system for mobile communication, which is the dominant second-generation standard in Europe and many other areas. It is largely associated with Ericsson but is also supported by Nokia of Finland, Siemens of Germany and others. **********Despite the engineers' early doubts, C.D.M.A., which was chosen by Sprint PCS and a few other carriers, turned out to work just fine -- and perhaps better than fine. So Qualcomm was upset when in October 1996, just as C.D.M.A. was emerging, Ericsson sued Qualcomm, charging that Ericsson held patents covering parts of Qualcomm's systems. The trial is scheduled to begin in April in a Federal court in Texas. **********Not much later, development began on the wireless third generation, and both Qualcomm and Ericsson chose to use C.D.M.A. technology for transmitting digital data at high speed. **********But in developing third-generation systems, Qualcomm and Ericsson seemed to have different agendas. Qualcomm wanted the new systems to be compatible with existing C.D.M.A. systems, so that carriers would not have to scrap their investments and Qualcomm could continue to sell second-generation C.D.M.A. with the promise that it could be upgraded. **********Ericsson, with no installed base of C.D.M.A. systems, did not appear as concerned with the compatibility issue. So with European partners, it developed a technology that is not compatible with existing C.D.M.A. services. It said it simply wanted the most robust, advanced system possible. But some United States executives and officials smelled a plot after the European Union adopted a directive in December that appeared to force European carriers to use Ericsson's third-generation technology. **********Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright; Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley; Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and William E. Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, sent a letter to the Europeans expressing concern over the policy. **********Last month, the European commissioner for telecommunications, Martin Bangemann, appeared to mollify American policy makers somewhat by saying that competing standards would not be barred from Europe. But suspicion remains. **********An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ''It appears to some of us that our friends in Europe want to duplicate the conditions that allowed GSM to become the predominant global second-generation technology: Get it to market first, mandate it as a pan-European standard and make sure it's not backwards-compatible with existing wireless networks in North America.'' **********Ericsson and Qualcomm have now each claimed patent rights over each other's third-generation proposals, and the International Telecommunication Union says it cannot certify a standard until the property rights are settled. Qualcomm wants Ericsson to converge its standard with Qualcomm's in a way that grants existing C.D.M.A. operators thorough compatibility. Ericsson has so far refused, saying such convergence would yield a technically inferior standard. **********The end game may be a proliferation of multiple standards. For consumers, that could mean abandoning hope for a seamless global wireless network. Or it could mean higher prices if carriers and equipment makers have to offer many technologies to insure seamless global wireless systems."

Smith, a scout vaunted as the ''bravest of the brave'' during the Texas Revolution, lost his hearing as a result of a childhood disease. Ward, who lost a leg to a cannonball during the same revolution, went on to serve as mayor of Austin and commissioner of the General Land Office. **********For several years Ms. Pound, director of the Governor's Committee on People with Disabilities, as well as others, gathered details for the history. About two years ago, she hired a researcher to help. But all the work seemed like duplicated effort. **********Then another committee worker stumbled across the on-line version of the ''New Handbook of Texas,'' an encyclopedia of the state's history, geography and culture. The discovery opened a whole new world. **********The worker, Curtis Edmonds, soon found that he was able to search efficiently in the handbook using terms that apply to disabilities. He started coming up with material that likely would not have been uncovered in the printed version of the handbook, which has 24,000 entries in six volumes. **********''I would say that the greatest blessing for us was when the handbook went on line,'' Ms. Pound said. ''The information had been there, we just didn't have staff to read six volumes of stuff.'' **********Although state and city encyclopedias, in printed form, have gained in popularity since the publication of Kenneth T. Jackson's ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'' in 1995, only a few of the publications are on line in complete form. The historians who have helped put those works on the Web have found the on-line form offers advantages. **********''It's an endless Web,'' said John Grabowski, managing editor of the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, which has been on line since 1996 (http://ech.cwru.edu). ''It's a very plastic tool in terms of our ability to enhance it and change it. You can almost shape it anyway you want to.'' **********When the Texas State Historical Association was revising the print version of the state handbook, ''we had in mind that we wanted the text to be in electronic form so it could be updated and corrected much easier,'' said Douglas Barnett, assistant director of the association, which put the handbook on line (www.tsha.utexas.edu) with the help of the University of Texas at Austin libraries. **********Some of the corrections and updates come from other historians, but some come from ordinary citizens. In Texas, the historical association is receiving 30 to 40 E-mail messages a day from readers who send corrections or who just want to share their own experiences. **********For example, the handbook's compilers asked a California woman to write about her recollections of life in Christoval, Tex., where she moved when she was 8, after she E-mailed her thanks for an article about the town in the handbook. **********Her observations are little more than snippets from a child's life in a small Texas town in 1966; her impression of her house and swimming and fishing in a nearby creek. But developers of the handbook site see an opportunity to provide texture to the basic encyclopedia and would like in the future to link such elements to the site. **********On-line versions also offer the luxury of space. When the Cleveland work was first published in book form in 1987 (along with a companion volume, ''The Dictionary of Cleveland Biography''), 300 articles had to be cut for lack of space. But with unlimited space available for the on-line version, the articles were included, and new ones added, including an article about the city's carriage industry of the 19th century. Photographs that did not make the print version were put on line as well. **********The possibilities of on-line encyclopedias are creating interest in other cities. **********The Chicago Historical Society is currently working on an encyclopedia with the Newberry Library, which they hope to publish in 2001 or 2002. Simultaneously, they are working with Northwestern University on technologies to create an electronic version of the work, which they hope to bring out six months to a year later. **********''We have in mind an electronic encyclopedia more spectacular than the print version,'' said Douglas Greenberg, president of the society. **********Drawing on vast collections of photographs, videos and audio, researchers are working to create a ''guided tour through Chicago streets at the turn of the century,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''There will be music from the history of jazz and blues, all sorts of things from the collections in the Chicago Historical Society.'' **********One of the biggest hurdles to such projects is finding money to pay for them. Historical groups in both Texas and Cleveland have been assisted by universities, which has helped to keep costs down. Still, Mr. Barnett estimated that the two-year effort to get the Texas site running cost about $100,000. Despite the costs, Mr. Greenberg said ''I think printed encyclopedias are dinosaurs.'' **********Putting information on line makes research quick and easy. **********''Now the finding is almost instantaneous and it's the using we can give our energy to. That's the power of technology,'' he said. ''Certainly it's changed my job as head of an institution and it's changed the way I do my work as a historian.'' **********''It takes it out of the realm of that esoteric ivory tower,'' said Mr. Grabowski,  an assistant professor of history at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. ''It's like the History Channel,'' he said. ''A lot of people said that would never fly.'' **********For Ms. Pound, the on-line encyclopedia offered another advantage over the printed version. She is blind, and the book is not published in Braille. But the on-line handbook is accessible through her screen-reader software. **********''I almost flipped out,'' she said recalling a Saturday she sat down to see if she could make it work. ''Five hours later my son said, 'What's so fun?' '' **********Ms. Pound and her co-workers found all sorts of interesting people through the handbook, particularly some from the 1800's that were not in other sources. Blind Lemon Smith Jefferson is a good example. A musician credited with being one of the creators of blues, he was born blind in Coutchman, Tex., in July 1897. **********Beyond finding more people, the handbook also helped them to draw some conclusions and give a sense of where Texans with disabilities fit into history. For example, by searching the handbook they were able to establish that at least eight counties are named for people with disabilities, including Deaf Smith, Ms. Pound said. **********The committee, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in April, released its book -- ''From Isolation to Participation . . . A History of Disability in Texas'' -- as part of the celebration. The book was put on line at www.governor.state.tx.us/disabilities. **********Ms. Pound said as the committee's history of disability was getting ready to go to the printer she called Mr. Barnett at the Texas historical association to thank him for putting the encyclopedia on line. **********''I told him I'm a real life example of the kind of things that can be done because you have the handbook on line.''"

Military officers will control the military, the police and foreign affairs, he said, but some civilians will be allowed to serve, and the cabinet will draft a new constitution and pursue ''a real democracy.'' **********But the coup's leader, Gen. Robert Guei, issued a subtle warning: ''I don't find it useful to dissolve political parties,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying. ''But on the other hand, let me say that we are counting on you to avoid troubles.'' **********At the same time, he gave signals that he might be following the liberal model set recently by military officers in Nigeria and Niger: an illegal overthrow of an unpopular and authoritarian civilian government, followed by democratic reforms. **********Mr. Bedie was flown to Togo on Sunday on a French military aircraft, and French officials said he would be welcome here. But today he was reported to have gone to Nigeria to meet with President Olusegun Obasanjo. Details of their talks were not released, but Nigeria is the dominant military and economic power in the Economic Community of West African States, of which Ivory Coast is a member, and Mr. Bedie may have been exploring his chances of being restored to office. **********Nigeria already denounced the coup, which arose after looting by unhappy soldiers last Thursday. General Guei's coup was announced on Friday while the government was negotiating with the soldiers. By Saturday, when even the national police force, which Mr. Bedie had pampered and filled with members of his Baoule ethnic group, declined to fight  for him, it became clear that his government was finished. **********How spontaneous the mutiny was remains in question, because General Guei's junta is full of supporters of Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister who had hoped to run against Mr. Bedie for the presidency next year but was being excluded on the ground that he was not really a  citizen of Ivory Coast. **********Other citizens of Ivory Coast do not seem to miss Mr. Bedie much. No demonstrations demanding his restoration were reported and patrolling soldiers whose commanders had ousted him were treated in friendly fashion by civilians. **********Mr. Bedie won a power struggle in 1993 after the death of Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who ruled Ivory Coast since its independence in 1960.  But Mr. Bedie's entourage was thought to have enriched itself from aid funds at a time when the country was suffering from low prices for cocoa, cotton, coffee and other exports. Big donors like the International Monetary Fund and the European Union began suspending payments this year. **********Unemployment and crime rose, and Mr. Bedie blamed the need to repay donors for budget problems. **********Perhaps more important, he had grown more authoritarian and had promoted a nationalist doctrine -- Ivorite, or ''Ivory-ness'' -- that labeled some people non-Ivoirians based on the birthplaces of their parents or grandparents. The effect was to make southerners the only real Ivoirians while calling northern Muslims like Mr. Ouattara foreigners. **********French leaders portrayed Mr. Bedie as the first major casualty of France's new policy of nonintervention in its former African colonies. Long after England, Portugal and Belgium had given up doing so, France had been willing to use troops to thwart coups and tribal fighting, and to instruct its central bank to bolster currencies. **********Because it was relatively stable and prosperous, Ivory Coast, along with Senegal and Gabon, was viewed as a cornerstone of French policy toward its former colonies. But even though Mr. Bedie enjoyed support in the inner circle of President Jacques Chirac, there was a worry that his policies could split the country and set off a civil war. In the end, he was offered the minimum: protection from mobs, a dignified getaway and an offer of asylum in France. **********''There's no longer any question of interfering in internal political debates, no longer any question of maintaining this or that leader against the popular will,'' said Charles Josselin, the French minister of cooperation. **********This could be interpreted, he added, as ''a signal'' to African leaders ''who don't respect democratic rights.'' **********But even in its new hands-off posture, France almost inadvertently meddled in the coup. There are 550 French marines on a base near the airport in Abidjan, the economic capital; Mr. Bedie took refuge with them and they flew him out. **********Suggestions that another 350 French soldiers from Gabon and Senegal might enter Ivory Coast to ''help evacuate French nationals'' infuriated General Guei. If their real plans were to interfere with self-rule in Ivory Coast, he said, there could be a blood bath. He refused them entry."

Price an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said, ''It doesn't give you a warm comfortable feeling, when a company can't even answer the question: What is your aggregate membership base?'' **********A spokeswoman for Aetna said the company was ''disappointed with the reaction of some investors.'' The transaction ''should provide a good return on investment,'' said Joyce Oberdorf, the spokeswoman. But analysts said Aetna had rebuffed a request at the meeting for return on investment projections. **********Ms. Oberdorf said Aetna was waiting to see how many Prudential members remained loyal after higher monthly premiums take effect next year. Many Prudential members will have to decide whether to stay or switch to another health plan in the sign-up period now under way. Prudential has posted price increases of 10 to 16 percent, and employers are likely to pass some of that increase to employees. **********Ms. Oberdorf said membership results would be included when the company issued its next quarterly financial report."

Many manufacturers in North America and Europe are in the midst of a record year for vehicle sales. **********But the boom on both sides of the Atlantic might be sputtering to an end, analysts and industry officials say. Current predictions hover around a drop of 2 percent in Europe and North America, with a decline of 4 percent predicted for some countries. **********""Sentiment among carmakers is likely to be low-key, given the gloomy outlook in the industry,"" said Juergen Pieper, an auto-industry analyst at the B. Metzler Sohn & Co. bank in Frankfurt. **********""The debate is: Are we at the peak?"" said Chris Will of Lehman Brothers in London. The culprit, analysts say, is the end of the ""replacement cycle"" โ the need to replace aging vehicles. The cycle currently is at its low, which means that consumer demand for new vehicles is close to saturated. **********Demand will also abate because few best-selling mass-market models are due for launch soon, analysts say. **********As a result, North American and European car sales could fall by nearly 2 percent next year and 1 percent in 2001, according to Mr. Pieper. New car sales could fall as much as 4 percent in France and Spain next year with smaller declines in Germany and Britain, he said. **********""The uncertainty is very considerable,"" said Christian Breitsprecher, analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, who forecasts a 2.5 percent drop in European new car registrations. **********""Gloomy is a good word for it,"" said Manfred Sieg, publisher of the Bonn-based newsletter Automotive Review, of the industry mood going into the show. ""Demand will decline, but nobody knows by how much."" **********Frankfurt's biannual auto show traditionally ranks among the industry's most important events. Although not the biggest โ that honor belongs to the Detroit International Auto Show โ Frankfurt takes place in the home market of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and DaimlerChrysler AG, whose cars have kept Germans at the forefront of an increasingly global business. Germany also ranks as the world's biggest car market outside the United States. **********Auto industry doomsayers have been wrong before: As recently as last year, they predicted a downturn for 1999. Instead, the opposite happened. **********In the United States, the world's largest national market, sales of new cars and light trucks this year are almost certain to outstrip their 1986 record of 16.1 million vehicles. In Germany, registrations will hit a record 3.7 million, according to a consensus of estimates. **********Across Western Europe, new car sales rose a phenomenal 8 percent in the first six months of the year. **********The industry has its optimistic voices. ""It is not that gloomy,"" said John Lawson, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ""Prospects for the European economy have been rising. Many car companies found themselves unnecessarily pessimistic for 1999."" **********But investors clearly are nervous. **********An indication came last month when DaimlerChrysler published its second-quarter financial report. The numbers were good but did not reflect a continued boom. Sales rose 10.2 percent, but operating profit increased by a less brisk 6.6 percent. In the next three days, the stock market punished the German-American company with a brutal 15 percent stock sell-off. **********Slowdown or not, car buyers already have reason to celebrate. As car executives roll up their sleeves and devise strategies to make and sell cars in flat markets, buyers can count on some of the sweetest deals in years on a new car, analysts say. To move cars off the lot, many of the so-called volume manufacturers already have begun to lure buyers with discounts, rebates and cheap leasing and financing deals. **********The trend already is well entrenched in the hotly competitive U.S. market, where cash-back incentives are running near record levels. And European car prices, which for years have outpaced the rate of inflation, are stagnant or in some cases falling. **********""Competition has never been so severe in Europe โ never,"" said a senior executive at one of Europe's biggest vehicle makers. **********The average per-vehicle incentive at the former Chrysler Corp., now part of DaimlerChrysler, rose to $1,470 by midyear from $1,248 in the first quarter of 1999, the company said. Robert Eaton, co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler, predicts that incentives will remain at those generous levels at least for now. **********In Germany, DaimlerChrysler has cut 500 Deutsche marks ($265) from the cost of its two-seat Smart car. Speculation about price wars in Britain forced Ford Motor Co.'s British operations Friday to make an unusual and generous offer. With its ""innovative price promise,"" Ford awkwardly pledged to reimburse any customer who buys a new Ford if the company ends up cutting prices after the customer buys the car."

Music burst forth from two dozen string and wind instruments in perfect synchronization, without a conductor to summon it. **********An hour later, during a break, the business school students who had been watching the chamber orchestra rehearse had the same question: How did you all start playing at the same moment? **********''Body gestures,'' Eriko Sato, the first violinist on the piece, Telemann's ''Water Music,'' said as she shrugged her shoulders to demonstrate. The musicians watch one another closely, they explained, and as each new movement begins, they know where to look for their cue. **********This is Orpheus, the orchestra with no conductor and the ultimate flat, nonhierarchical organization. Its members had come to the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College, the only M.B.A.-granting public school in New York City, to explain how they won three Grammys this year and have become an annual fixture at Carnegie Hall without ever having an onstage boss. **********It was a compelling sight: Artists who make about $30,000 a year teaching would-be executives who will bring home twice that in their first year out of school. But Orpheus has more in common with some of America's largest companies than the casual observer might think. The group has become a living, and entertaining, microcosm of a management theory that has been transforming corporate America throughout the 1990's. **********Spurred first by the corporate downsizing that began the decade and then by the Internet explosion that is ending it, hundreds of American companies are trying to become ''flatter'' by removing management layers between top executives and people in the field. The movement began as an effort to cut costs, but it has picked up steam, even during the current economic expansion, as executives try to reshape their companies to react quickly to technological change. **********''Speed is becoming the most important criterion for growth and survival,'' said C. K. Prahalad, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has advised Citicorp and Oracle. ''That is taking decision-making and accountability to levels that are closest to the business.'' **********A 1996 survey of large companies by the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California found that 78 percent had removed at least one layer of management in the previous decade, while 14 percent reported getting rid of at least three. **********The proponents of flatter structures are some of the best-performing companies of the 1990's, like Wal-Mart and Cisco Systems. ''The more nodes in a communications link, the more likely it is that bad information goes up to the top,'' said Steven Kerr, the vice president for leadership development at General Electric, which has tried to remove management layers. At their worst, Mr. Kerr added, bureaucratic organizations can resemble the childhood game of telephone, in which children line up and pass a whispered message from one to the next, only to have the end result barely resemble the original statement. **********Orpheus -- named for a mythological Greek character whose beautiful music tamed wild beasts -- has never needed to eliminate layers because, onstage at least, it has never had any. Julian Fifer, a cellist, and a few friends founded the group in 1972 with the aim of replicating the give-and-take of small chamber music groups in the larger setting of a chamber orchestra. **********For every piece, a core group of musicians meets to decide how to play it. The first violinist, known as the concertmaster, typically leads the rehearsals, distilling the core group's plan into one voice. During pauses, other musicians call out suggestions, or objections, and hold smaller debates within their section of the orchestra. **********When disagreements arise, Orpheus members try to talk them out until they reach a consensus. Failing that, they take a vote. **********It is not always smooth sailing. Last year, Mr. Fifer, who had stopped playing with the group in 1990, stepped down as its executive director, a job in which he oversaw the group's schedule and business matters. His resignation came after he had clashed with group members who thought Orpheus was spending too much time on international tours. **********Without a conductor to make final decisions, smaller matters can be tricky, too. At the Zicklin School rehearsal, the students noticed that some musicians had spoken much more often than others and wondered whether more outgoing people had too big a say in decisions. Many of the musicians smiled, to acknowledge that this was an issue, but said they tried to speak up frequently only when they were members of the core group. **********As a whole, however, they are not shy about offering criticism. At Zicklin, for example, Nardo Poy, a violist, stood up at one point and said, ''I know it's water music, but it sounds like it's a little at sea.'' At another break, Ms. Sato politely but firmly dismissed a criticism by waving her hand and saying, ''We are working on this.'' **********In a standard orchestra, where the conductor is king, such give-and-take is virtually unheard of. Much as a corporate vice president's word can be final in a highly structured company, musicians do not question a conductor during rehearsal. One result is a message that is clear but, Orpheus members say, stifles creativity. **********Renee Jolles, a violinist who plays with the group frequently, said, ''When you play with a conductor, it's easy to sit there and do what you're told.'' Orpheus members, by contrast, are willing to lend advice to other musicians, knowing that critiquing the performance is not the job solely of one person. **********''Orpheus gives every individual the opportunity to lead,'' said Harvey Seifter, the current executive director. ''But it also creates an imperative that everyone pull together.'' **********That seeming contradiction has helped the group land consulting gigs. Earlier this year, Kraft Foods invited Orpheus to its Illinois headquarters in an attempt to teach product managers to be more honest about their disagreements, Mr. Seifter said. And over the next two years, the orchestra will hold seminars for hospital administrators in the United States and for companies in Berlin and Paris. Eventually, Mr. Seifter said, 10 percent of the orchestra's income could come from such activities. **********Companies, for their part, are hoping that shedding bureaucracy will help them replicate the connection that Orpheus members, who often devote hours to hashing out musical decisions, feel to the group. That connection can reduce employee turnover, which has become a crucial issue for businesses as the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in 29 years. **********Sturman Industries, a mechanical-valve designer in Woodland Park, Colo., might be considered the Orpheus of the corporate world. The 140-person company is split into 12 functional groups, each with a coordinator who oversees administrative functions and can make final decisions when a consensus is unreachable. Other than the coordinators and the company's president, Carol Sturman, nobody has a title. **********''It's not the easy route,'' Ms. Sturman said, because people are used to working in a more structured environment and are sometimes confused about what to do. But it has paid off: Sales at Sturman, a privately held company, are expected to increase 60 percent this year. And since moving to Colorado from California three years ago, the company said it had lost only four employees, a remarkable retention rate in the current labor market. **********The move toward flatter organizations shows little sign of abating. Management textbooks, which once extolled ''seven-by-seven'' companies that had seven levels of management and assigned seven workers to most managers, now trumpet the elimination of hierarchy. **********Business schools besides Zicklin are training their students to work in a less structured world, too. At the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, for example, Prof. Michael Useem has brought an improvisational acting group into his classroom and led a group of M.B.A.'s on trekking trips in the Himalayas, all with an eye to better understanding how less structured groups interact. **********''When you have a hierarchical structure, you can get away with having managers who get people to do things because of their position,'' said Mike Jenner, who teaches leadership at the University of Chicago. The more relevant question now, he said, is ''how can you manage the performance of others when you don't have the power over them?''"

Chinese are overwhelmingly non-Muslims, while nearly all Malays are Muslim.

""That is why the Indonesians attack the Chinese."" **********To disprove Mr. Habibie's assertion that there were no Malay officers in the Singapore military, The Straits Times of Singapore printed photographs Thursday of two such officers โ one a lieutenant colonel, the other a captain. **********In a separate editorial, it said that Indonesia's recovery was going to be an uphill struggle, both on the political and economic fronts. **********""Politically, the Habibie government lacks popular support and finds it hard to rein in the growing lawlessness that has done much to damage the country's prospects,"" the newspaper said. ""Corporate Indonesia is saddled with $70 billion in foreign debts, and some of the government's policies to create and redistribute wealth have sparked off controversy, notably the attempt to build 'a people's economy' in which small and medium-size enterprises"" owned by indigenous Indonesians ""get preferential treatment."" **********Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan of Singapore said recently that the almost daily reports from the region of demonstrations, protests, riots and violence were ""a stark reminder to Singaporeans on how internal dissension can tear a society apart and inflict almost irreparable damage on an economy."""

Its designers said that Gnome would make it possible for people who are not programmers or technicians to use Linux and the software that runs on it comfortably. **********Linux, which was developed over the last 15 years by a loosely organized movement of programmers known as GNU (the name is a Mobius strip-like acronym that stands for ''GNU's not Unix'') has been rapidly gaining ground among corporate and technical users of server computers and workstations because of its power and stability. **********But as a member of the Unix family of operating systems, it is manipulated by esoteric commands, not with the point-and-click graphical interfaces to which mouse-wielding consumers have grown accustomed. **********Gnome puts a friendly face on Linux by inserting a graphical interface between the operating system and the user, in much the way that Windows was originally an interface between users and MS-DOS. **********In the last year, the corporate world has begun to take Linux seriously, and its prospects brightened considerably with the announcement that I.B.M. would begin shipping it on some powerful server computers that manage large networks. **********The organizers of the free software movement have said, however, that they do not intend to limit Linux to corporate systems engineers. **********''This is aimed directly at the Windows desktop dominance,'' said Jean Bozeman, a research manager at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm. **********Gnome offers a set of ''themes'' that imitate the appearance of various operating systems, including  Windows and Macintosh. **********Gnome's development has been led by Miguel de Icaza, a 26-year-old Mexican programmer and systems administrator for the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. **********He predicted that the program would attract a strong international backing, noting for example that the Mexican Government was planning to distribute a million copies to schools as part of a system known as Scholarnet. **********''Gnome is not just a pretty face,'' he said. It adds to Linux a number of sophisticated and attractive technical features. **********Gnome is distributed with a word processor, spreadsheet, data base, presentation manager, Web browser and E-mail. The program's designers said they were hoping to persuade commercial software developers to convert their Windows programs to take advantage of Gnome's features. **********Today's announcement, which was made by the Free Software Foundation and Red Hat Software Inc., a Linux developer, served as evidence of progress for the Linux movement.  But it also hinted at internal tensions that have been building within GNU. **********That is because while Gnome is the most ambitious effort yet to put a simplified face on Linux, it is by no means the only effort. There are already several user interfaces available for Linux, and there has been growing concern that incompatibilities between them could handicap an operating system known for its integrity. **********Neither Windows nor the Macintosh operating system is as stable as Linux, but they are attractive to software developers because each offers a single set of rules that programmers follow when writing code. That is possible because the graphical interfaces are built in to those operating systems. Forcing programmers to write different code for each Linux interface would undermine efforts to attract third-party development for it. **********For that reason, it was notable that today's announcement received the blessing of Richard Stallman, the iconoclastic founder of the GNU movement and a Cambridge, Mass., programmer. **********Mr. Stallman told reporters that the free software movement had now achieved much of what he set out to do in the 1970's, when he began trying to liberate software programs from proprietary control. **********''Fifteen years ago they said this was impossible,'' he said. ''They said this was too large a task.''"

He spent much of today in meetings with advisers, reviewing the company's possible moves, according to one executive who spent part of the day with him. **********Executives close to the company said tonight that Mannesmann was considering whether to accelerate the previously announced sale of its automotive and engineering units and was expected to provide details of its spinoff strategy on Tuesday morning. **********Investors seemed to grow more skeptical about Vodafone's chances of success. Mannesmann shares fell 6.95 euros in Frankfurt today, to 186.15 euros (about $191.73), the second consecutive drop. The shares have fallen more than 10 percent since Friday, when Vodafone announced its stock offer -- valued at 240 euros a share. **********Shares of Vodafone fell 0.25 pence here, to 275.25 pence ($4.46). Vodafone's American depository receipts closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $44.375, down $2.625; each A.D.R. represents 10 ordinary shares. **********As details of Vodafone's bid emerged today, it became clear that if its offer for Mannesmann succeeded, Vodafone would have to take the largest corporate loan ever to finance the transaction. According to executives close to the company, Vodafone is considering borrowing about $36 billion to make the acquisition and to refinance its current debt."

A combined Bell Atlantic-GTE would control about a third of the United States local phone industry and would have major Internet and wireless phone units as well as a growing long-distance voice business. **********''This game is about having four or five or six major global players that compete against each other and hold each other at bay,'' said Charles R. Lee, chairman of GTE. ''That's what the world needs.'' **********Of the GTE votes that were cast, 96.7 percent favored the merger. But because many shares were not voted, only about 76 percent of the total shares outstanding were voted in favor, exceeding the two-thirds required to approve the deal. **********Bell Atlantic shareholders are scheduled to vote today. Assuming that they approve the deal, the main hurdle still facing it would be review by the Federal Communications Commission. The Justice Department has approved it, subject to the sale of some wireless businesses. **********The F.C.C. will consider at least two major issues. The first is that GTE has about 100,000 long-distance customers in Bell Atlantic's region, and Bell Atlantic is now barred from selling long-distance service in that territory. But the U S West-Global Crossing deal demonstrated that many people in the communications industry believe such small overlaps can be finessed, perhaps by simply selling those customers to another carrier. **********The second, and more serious, issue is that GTE, through its BBN subsidiary, runs one of the nation's most extensive data communications networks. Bell Atlantic is prohibited from selling long-distance data communications. Though GTE's overlapping long-distance voice customers could be peeled off relatively easily -- they are concentrated in Pennsylvania and Virginia -- the BBN data unit does business throughout Bell Atlantic's territory. **********Ivan G. Seidenberg, chairman of Bell Atlantic, would not say how he intended to solve that problem if Bell Atlantic could not get quick long-distance approval. But in a deft New York sports reference, he said his company would not stop fighting to keep all parts of GTE. **********''Just like Allan Houston, you've got to play the whole game,'' he said in an interview, referring to the Knicks guard who played poorly for much of the contest but then made the game-winning shot on Sunday night against the Miami Heat in a critical playoff game."

Even as one lane is used for browsing the Web and sending E-mail using a modem, the other is a route for hackers to invade home and office computers. **********In the past, only companies with deep pockets could afford the large price tag of anti-hacker software -- but the growth of small companies and home users has meant a growth in susceptible systems. Black Ice, a new anti-hacker system from Network Ice, in San Mateo, Calif., sells for around $37 per computer, a price that is affordable for small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as home users. Home and business versions of the software can be downloaded at the company's Web site at www.networkice.com. **********While the hacker is attacking a computer, Black Ice can automatically trace the hacker back to the source and display the information to the computer user. In comparison, traditional hunts for hackers, because of a quirk in the Internet protocol, require manual searches through computer log records once the hacker is long gone. **********Traditionally, networks dedicate one computer to watch all the incoming data for all the computers. However, dedicated computers cannot go out and hunt for culprits. Black Ice breaks up the system by having each computer monitor itself, which allows it simultaneously to trace perpetrators. **********Rockliffe, a Santa Clara-based Internet company, recently experienced hacker attacks from someone trying to steal copies of its product, an Internet-based mail server. **********''If this guy was to have successfully breached our security and get confidential information, there are a variety of things which could potentially cripple our company and bring us to our knees,'' said Dan Arndt, customer service manager of Rockliffe. **********Black Ice traced the attacker back to his Internet service provider in Brazil. Rockliffe contacted the I.S.P. and the I.S.P. shut down the hacker's accounts. **********''There's a danger that anybody's computer can be hacked,'' said Michael Flynn, manager for Internet and international antipiracy at the Software Information and Industry Association.

In recent months, E-commerce companies have learned that carefully aimed E-mail messages may be the best means to cut through the clutter of the medium and deliver a personalized pitch to the consumer -- not to mention profits to the retailer. **********E-commerce executives say the trend will very likely produce a glut of what is known as ''opt-in'' E-mail -- so called because, unlike unsolicited commercial messages, consumers agree to receive it. Though E-mail overload threatens to dull the effectiveness of such campaigns in the long term, for now, companies are stepping up their E-mail efforts in hopes of establishing a dialogue with customers before their rivals do. **********''Opt-in E-mail is a critical part of our marketing strategy going forward,'' said Kent Anderson, president of Macys.com, a division of Federated Department Stores, which sends 12 to 15 E-mail messages annually to each person on a customer list that he says now numbers hundreds of thousands of people. **********As is the case with most companies' mailing lists, those people signed up to receive E-mail updates and offers while they were visiting Macy's Web site, and they can unsubscribe to the list at any time. They can also stipulate that Macy's not share their E-mail addresses and other personal information with outside organizations. **********Like other executives, Mr. Anderson said E-mail's chief value was that it enabled companies to conduct direct marketing campaigns without having to pay millions of dollars for postage. ''We can take demographic elements and say, 'Give me everybody who looks like this customer,' and test different offers, so the odds are much better they'll respond,'' he said. **********Indeed, Mr. Anderson said, customers who respond to the opt-in E-mail messages by visiting Macy's Web site buy, on average, five to seven times more frequently than other visitors to the site. This so-called conversion rate of visitors to buyers ''is why everybody likes this,'' he said. **********Likewise, ''click-through'' rates, or the rate at which people visit a World Wide Web site after viewing an advertisement or a promotional message, are sharply higher for opt-in E-mail campaigns than for Web banner advertisements. **********According to Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm, such E-mail marketing messages generate click-through rates of between 10 and 20 percent. Banner advertisements, on the other hand, have seen click-through rates fall to below 1 percent in recent months. Given those numbers, it is not surprising that in a recent Forrester survey of 50 Internet companies, more than  two-thirds said they viewed opt-in E-mail messages as ''important'' or ''very important'' to their marketing efforts. **********Brian Sugar, director of new media for J. Crew, said that the company had two types of opt-in E-mail campaigns. The first is a message sent every Thursday night, giving recipients early access to the site's weekly sale items, which are posted to the public at noon on Friday. Mr. Sugar said that J. Crew had compiled a list of E-mail addresses ''in the millions'' by offering the site's visitors the opportunity to sign up for such updates. **********The second type of E-mail message is sent to distinct segments of J. Crew's mailing list, informing recipients of new products or promotions about once a month. In those mailings, Mr. Sugar said, the company sifts through customer demographic and purchase information and sends different people different offers. Or, for those who have not ordered anything on line, the company will sometimes send an E-mail coupon for $20 off a purchase of $80 or more, as it did last week. **********Mr. Sugar said that J. Crew was forecasting much better response and conversion rates from its E-mail campaigns than from its off-line direct-mailing efforts. ''With our ability to slice and dice the data,'' he said, ''we can send personalized offers to women buyers, men buyers, or men buyers who only buy black medium-sized shirts -- and the cost is so much less we can focus on more personalized offers like that.'' **********Analysts said, though, that companies with little or no direct-marketing experience could have difficulty running such programs, given the extensive data base analysis needed to send millions of E-mail messages to specific client segments -- unless the companies want to risk alienating recipients with misguided recommendations. **********For that reason, companies that conduct E-mail promotions on behalf of Internet retailers have reported brisk demand for their services in recent months. These companies, like Messagemedia and Digital Impact, take opt-in E-mail lists compiled by clients and run the mailings on their behalf, analyzing results and refining the pitches as the campaign proceeds. **********The companies maintain what they say are strict policies regarding the privacy of consumers' personal information, and offer plenty of opportunities to be removed from the mailing list. Clients typically pay these firms 2 cents to 4 cents each E-mail delivered, while maintaining complete ownership of the customers' data. **********Notably, these companies often use technology that can recognize the sophistication of the recipient's E-mail software. As a result, users who can receive more sophisticated E-mail messages -- which essentially look like a Web page -- are sent messages that include rich graphics and photos of merchandise. When recipients click on these images, they are immediately sent to a Web page where they can buy the product. **********According to Forrester, such capabilities can double the response rate of a mailing, though many Internet users can't receive such messages. **********Internet businesses can also rely on opt-in mailing lists generated by third parties like Netcreations, which solicits E-mail addresses on numerous Web sites, including Alta Vista, the Internet search service. By asking visitors if they would like to receive E-mail about various topics and products, Netcreations has gleaned close to three million E-mail addresses, said Rosalind Resnick, the company's president. **********Netcreations then sends E-mail offers to segments of that list on behalf of clients like Dell Computer and Microsoft, Ms. Resnick said. Netcreations does not disclose the recipients' names or personal information to those companies, she added. **********No matter who sends them, E-mail marketing messages will have to become more refined, analysts agree -- given the number of E-commerce sites already using E-mail to maintain relationships with customers and the growing number of companies planning to do so. **********''Most of the sites I look at understand that you have to approach the customer as a valuable asset, and you have to give them something of value,'' said Mr. Anderson of Macy's.com. ''E-mailing them just to say the sky is blue, and reminding them that Macy's is out there is a problem.''"
