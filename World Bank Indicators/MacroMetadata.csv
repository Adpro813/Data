PA.NUS.FCRF,CC BY-4.0,"Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average)",Official exchange rate refers to the exchange rate determined by national authorities or to the rate determined in the legally sanctioned exchange market. It is calculated as an annual average based on monthly averages (local currency units relative to the U.S. dollar).,"International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics.",Financial Sector: Exchange rates & prices,Annual,,"The exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another. Official exchange rates and exchange rate arrangements are established by governments. Other exchange rates recognized by governments include market rates, which are determined largely by legal market forces, and for countries with multiple exchange arrangements, principal rates, secondary rates, and tertiary rates.","In a market-based economy, household, producer, and government choices about resource allocation are influenced by relative prices, including the real exchange rate, real wages, real interest rates, and other prices in the economy. Relative prices also largely reflect these agents' choices. Thus relative prices convey vital information about the interaction of economic agents in an economy and with the rest of the world.","Official or market exchange rates are often used to convert economic statistics in local currencies to a common currency in order to make comparisons across countries. Since market rates reflect at best the relative prices of tradable goods, the volume of goods and services that a U.S. dollar buys in the United States may not correspond to what a U.S. dollar converted to another country's currency at the official exchange rate would buy in that country, particularly when nontradable goods and services account for a significant share of a country's output. An alternative exchange rate - the purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor - is preferred because it reflects differences in price levels for both tradable and nontradable goods and services and therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of real output.",https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
NY.GDP.MKTP.CD,CC BY-4.0,GDP (current US$),"GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using single year official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used.","World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.",Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: US$ at current prices: Aggregate indicators,Annual,Gap-filled total,"Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the sum of value added by all its producers. Value added is the value of the gross output of producers less the value of intermediate goods and services consumed in production, before accounting for consumption of fixed capital in production. The United Nations System of National Accounts calls for value added to be valued at either basic prices (excluding net taxes on products) or producer prices (including net taxes on products paid by producers but excluding sales or value added taxes). Both valuations exclude transport charges that are invoiced separately by producers. Total GDP is measured at purchaser prices. Value added by industry is normally measured at basic prices.",,"Gross domestic product (GDP), though widely tracked, may not always be the most relevant summary of aggregated economic performance for all economies, especially when production occurs at the expense of consuming capital stock.

While GDP estimates based on the production approach are generally more reliable than estimates compiled from the income or expenditure side, different countries use different definitions, methods, and reporting standards. World Bank staff review the quality of national accounts data and sometimes make adjustments to improve consistency with international guidelines. Nevertheless, significant discrepancies remain between international standards and actual practice. Many statistical offices, especially those in developing countries, face severe limitations in the resources, time, training, and budgets required to produce reliable and comprehensive series of national accounts statistics.

Among the difficulties faced by compilers of national accounts is the extent of unreported economic activity in the informal or secondary economy. In developing countries a large share of agricultural output is either not exchanged (because it is consumed within the household) or not exchanged for money.",https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
PA.NUS.PPP,CC BY-4.0,"PPP conversion factor, GDP (LCU per international $)","Purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter that controls for price level differences between countries, thereby allowing volume comparisons of gross domestic product (GDP) and its expenditure components. This conversion factor is for GDP.","International Comparison Program, World Bank | World Development Indicators database, World Bank | Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme.",Economic Policy & Debt: Purchasing power parity,Annual,,"PPPs are both currency conversion factors and spatial price indexes. PPPs convert different currencies to a common currency and, in the process of conversion, equalize their purchasing power by controlling differences in price levels between countries.

Typically, higher income countries have higher price levels, while lower income countries have lower price levels (Balassa-Samuelson effect). Market exchange rate-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components reflect both differences in economic outputs (volumes) and prices. Given the differences in price levels, the size of higher income countries is inflated, while the size of lower income countries is depressed in the comparison. PPP-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components only reflect differences in economic outputs (volume), as PPPs control for price level differences between the countries. Hence, the comparison reflects the real size of the countries.

The International Comparison Program (ICP) estimates PPPs for the world’s countries. The ICP is conducted as a global partnership of countries, multilateral agencies, and academia. The most recent 2021 ICP comparison covered 176 countries, including 47 Eurostat-OECD countries. For countries that have not participated in ICP comparisons, the PPP are imputed based on a regression model.

ICP estimated PPPs cover years from 2011 to 2021. WDI extrapolates 2011 PPPs for years earlier years, and 2021 PPPs for later years. Description of WDI extrapolation approach is available here: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/665452-how-do-you-extrapolate-the-ppp-conversion-factors

For the member countries of Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme, PPP conversion factors are periodically updated based on the organizations’ databases. For Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme, please refer to the following websites.
(http://www.oecd.org/sdd/prices-ppp/)
(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/purchasing-power-parities/overview)

For more information on the ICP and PPPs, please refer to the ICP website at https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp.","PPP can be used to convert national accounts data, like GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. They can also be used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.

PPPs and the PLIs and real (or PPP-adjusted) expenditures to which they give rise allow for many use-cases, but they are particularly valuable for empirical work involving comparisons of per capita consumption or levels of GDP (or other GDP aggregates) across countries and for the measurement of global poverty and global income inequality. The breadth and depth of ICP data allows its use-cases to cover other areas of economics, including empirical analyses of economic growth, productivity and trade, and even beyond, for instance, to help track global targets such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals related to health, education, energy and emissions and labor. Other applications of ICP data include their use in the construction of indexes, for example cost-of-living measures. Uses-cases can even be extended into the policymaking domain at all levels (global, regional and national) given the increased importance of cross-country benchmarking, among other possibilities.

Recommended uses of PPPs include: To make spatial comparisons of GDP and its expenditure components | To make spatial comparisons of price levels | To group countries by their per capita volume indexes and price level indexes

Recommended uses of PPPs with limitations  include: To analyze changes over time in relative GDP per capita and relative prices | To analyze price convergence | To make spatial comparisons of the cost of living | To use PPPs calculated for GDP and its expenditure components as deflators for other values.","Global PPP estimates provided by ICP are produced by the ICP Global Office and regional implementing agencies, based on data supplied by participating countries, and in accordance with the methodology recommended by the ICP Technical Advisory Group and approved by the ICP Governing Board. As such, these results are not produced by participating countries as part of their national official statistics.

PPPs are not recommended use: As a precise measure to establish strict rankings of countries | As a means of constructing national growth rates | As a measure to generate output and productivity comparisons by industry | As an indicator of the undervaluation or overvaluation of currencies | As an equilibrium exchange rate.",https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
